<h2 id="ch-----1">The four requisites</h2>
<p class="let">The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must <strong>limit his needs to a minimum</strong>. He is content with whatever is given to him, without ever asking for anything. Thus, he renounces everything that is superfluous, he avoids anything that could induce pleasure, comfort or distraction. His needs are of four kinds: <strong>nutrition</strong> (food, drinks, etc.); <strong>housing</strong> (monastery, hut, etc.); <strong>clothing</strong> (robes); and <strong>medicine</strong> (medicaments, remedies, first aid, hygienic products, etc.)</p>
<p>It is clear that everything the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> obtains must be exclusively to provide him the conditions required by his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> practice. It is only with this state of mind that the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> should use &ndash; or consume &ndash; the things at his disposal. For example, when he eats, it is only for nourishment, not for pleasure.</p>
<p>During the process of integration in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>, a new <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is told that he must henceforth go out for alms to collect his daily food, live under a tree, make his robes out of discarded cloth, and drink cow's urine as medicine. They are also told that if, on their part, the laity offer him other requisites, he is authorised to accept them (invitations for meals, lodging, new robes, medicines...)</p>
<p><strong>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must never ask for anything</strong> from anyone. If a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyaka</span> invites a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> to ask for what he needs, he could simply report his needs, but he should not under any circumstances request anything. However, a sick <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is allowed to ask for whatever he needs to be cured.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----2">The Food</h2>
<h3>Accepting and consuming food</h3>
<h4>Food collection.</h4>
<p class="let">If a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is invited for a meal or served a meal in his monastery, he can accept it. If not, he must take his bowl and go out to do his alms round (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">piṇḍapāta</span>). For this, he stops in front of the houses that he finds along his way, without entering (unless he is invited). When stopping in front of a house, he must stand still, silent, with his gaze lowered and his attention focused on the bowl. He must do nothing else than offering the laity the opportunity to cultivate merit through the food that they offer. When someone has placed food in his bowl, or after some time without anyone approaching, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> continues his way towards the next house. He does this until he reckons that he has obtained enough food.</p>
<p>During the round, there are six places where a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must avoid making a habit to go searching for food, even if he is invited: the house of a prostitute; the house of a widow; the house of an elderly celibate woman; the house of a homosexual; a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunīs</span> monastery; place of sale of alcoholic drinks. Although it is inadvisable to go frequently to these places in the daily alms round, it is however allowed to pass by them occasionally. Also, it is proper to accept the food that people from these places place in his bowl as he approaches on their path (or on the road), as well as the food that they bring to the monastery.</p>
<h4>When, what and how to accept?</h4>
<p>There are periods during which certain types of food are forbidden, or cannot be stored. See the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pācittiya</span>&nbsp;37 and 38. Also, the food can only be accepted if certain factors are respected. See the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pācittiya</span>&nbsp;40. A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must never show his preferences with respect to food. He must not even show whether he likes or not what is served to him. If a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyaka</span> offers to choose a dish or a menu for him, he must answer that <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> do not choose, that they eat whatever is given to them.</p>
<h4>The forbidden meats</h4>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must not be fastidious: he is content with what "falls into his bowl". However, he must not accept meat of an animal who has been slaughtered purposely for offering to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> or to him, or meat from ten animals considered at the time of the Buddha (and still today) as noble or sacred by a part of the population. To avoid offending those people, the Buddha forbid the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> to eat these ten kinds of meats which are: human flesh, dog, horse, elephant, leopard, tiger, lion, bear, hyena and snake.</p>
<h4>The flexibilities</h4>
<p>Concerning accepting or consuming food, there are, in special cases, certain flexibilities: in case of famine, the fruits requiring to be made authorised by a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kappiya</span> (See the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pācittiya</span>&nbsp;11) stored food, and food cooked by himself, are allowed; in case of health problems and in accordance with the needs of his medical treatment, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> can ask for a particular type of food, or eat a meal at any time &ndash; of day or night. Under normal conditions, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who has not obtained any food must fast until the next day.</p>
<h4>The frame of mind when consuming</h4>
<p>It is important to take into account the spirit in which a product is consumed; if salt or sugar are taken for a medical reason, he can store the first for life, and the second for seven days. However, if the same salt or sugar are taken for flavouring, they cannot be consumed or stored after the solar noon on the same day of their acquisition.</p>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pātimokkha</span> includes numerous rules regarding accepting and consuming food. See especially the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sekhiya</span>&nbsp;27 to 56.</p>
<h3>Conduct to observe when eating</h3>
<p>As at all other times, during his meal, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must pay attention to his smallest actions and gestures. In this way, it will be easy for him to adopt the proper manners.</p>
<p>The best places must be reserved to the more senior. All the members of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> must eat at the same time. Those who arrive first must meditate whilst waiting for others. Nobody must eat before the majority have already arrived at the table. Each <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must make an effort to arrive punctually. The conduct at the table must be based on equanimity and moderation. The dishes must not be kept close to oneself but passed around the table to allow everybody equal access. Reasonable amounts of food must be served in the bowl (or plate) to avoid leaving remainders at the end of the meal. Every <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must avoid leaving the dining room with any food. The taking and chewing of each mouthful of food must be done with attention. He must abstain from any conversation at the table, eat in silence and not make noise with the ustensils. Every <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must eat properly, using a spoon to serve himself and wash his hands before eating, especially if he eats with his hands. He must avoid spitting, coughing or sniffling. If this is unavoidable, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is required to do it discretely by turning the other way or moving away from the table. A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must not take away a cup, a spoon or any other ustensil without a good reason. If he has to do so, he must report it as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Although not obligatory, it is very important for a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> to adopt the habit of going to the village (or town) to collect his food with his bowl. This daily round is fundamental for bringing together and relate the lay world and that of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----3">The offerings</h2>
<p class="let">With regard to food, see the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pācittiya</span>&nbsp;40. With regard to the rest, if it is an object that can be carried (soap, robe, etc.), the same factors as for food, as well as the ensuing conditions, must be respected (substituting eating utensils by the appropriate ones). If, in contrast, it is an object that cannot be carried (monastery, tree, etc.), it is sufficient that the donor indicates the object and the beneficiary of his donation without ambiguity, for this to be acceptable. It is more appropriate to address large gifts to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> rather than to a single individual.</p>
<p>Remarks: A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is authorised to gather discarded cloths &ndash; to make himself a robe &ndash; without it being offered. See the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span>&nbsp;1.</p>
<h3>The five improper ways to obtain gifts</h3>
<ol>
<li>Lies: by pretending qualities that one does not have.</li>
<li>Flattery: talking in such a way as to flatter a donor.</li>
<li>Suggestion: suggesting offerings through veiled allusions.</li>
<li>Harassment: harass a donor to extract an offering.</li>
<li>Gain through gifts: give presents, or render services, with the purpose of obtaining more.</li>
</ol>
<p>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who uses an object that he has obtained incorrectly commits a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dukkaṭa</span>. This object must not be used by another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>, otherwise he too commits a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dukkaṭa</span>.</p>
<h3>Way of abandoning things</h3>
<p>Whether it is food or not, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> can abandon what is offered to him. An abandoned object can no longer be used &ndash; even by another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> &ndash; unless it is re-offered. <span class="rem">Attention:</span> food that has not been abandoned cannot be re-offered on another day. To abandon something, two factors are necessary:</p>
<ul class="lpp">
<li>the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must renounce the possession of the object by telling himself by word or thought that he abandons this object;</li>
<li>the object must be separate from the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> by a minimum distance of two cubits and one span (around 70 centimetres).</li>
</ul>
<p>When these two factors are met (in whichever order), the object is considered to be abandoned.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----4">The dāyaka and the kappiya</h2>
<h3>The dāyaka</h3>
<p class="let">A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyaka</span> is a benefactor who supports the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> materially. To do this, he provides, within the measure of his capabilities, for the needs of one or more <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>. A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> can communicate his needs to a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyaka</span> only if the latter has expressly invited him to do so. A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyaka</span> can offer food, robes, soap, lodging or books. See also "What are a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>'s means of support?"</p>
<h3>The kappiya</h3>
<p>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kappiya</span> is a person who offers to help the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> to carry out various tasks, notably, that which he is not authorised to do by the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> (open a fruit with seeds or stone, re-offer the food abandoned the night before, make payments, etc.)</p>
<p>As a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> cannot receive or handle money, if anyone wishes to offer him something but has no time to buy this, he/she can send the money needed to buy this thing to a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kappiya</span> (temporary or not). The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kappiya</span> then uses this money when paying for what was intended for the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>'s need(s). For example, a robe, transport tickets during a trip, medical consultation. After this, any remaining money must be returned to the donor. When the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> has been informed by the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kappiya</span> that money has been sent to him for the purchase of something, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> can simply say that he needs that particular thing. Under no circumstances should he ask "Buy me this. Buy me that!"</p>
<p>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kappiya</span> cannot be a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunī</span>, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇera</span> or a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇerī</span>, because these persons are also forbidden to handle money. A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must not accept anything that has been bought by another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhunī</span>, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇera</span> or a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇerī</span>. See also the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">nissaggiya</span>&nbsp;10 and the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pācittiya</span>&nbsp;11.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----5">The vassa</h2>
<p class="let">Every year, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is obliged to reside for three months at the same place; from the full moon of July (sometimes August) until that of October (sometimes November). In South Asia, this period corresponds to the rainy season, translated in Pali by the word <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span>. During the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span>, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> cannot spend a night in another place unless he has a good reason (teaching the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, visiting a sick parent, etc.) and then only for six nights in succession. At the end of these, it is enough for him to spend at least one night in the monastery where he started to observe his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span> so as to be able to absent himself again for a few nights. As soon as the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> enters the enclosure of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vihāra</span> where he observes his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span>, even if he has spent the previous night somewhere else, he is obliged to spend the following night at this <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vihāra</span>.</p>
<p>There are cases in which the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> are not at fault if they change their place of residence during the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span>. These are extreme situations in which the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> no longer have the possibility of satisfying their vital needs: the village is about to be deserted (burnt, flooded, attacked, infected); dangerous animals threaten or attack the monastery; the monastery is destroyed; access to the village becomes impossible; etc.</p>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who, for any reason, cannot observe the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span> from the full moon of July (or beginning of August), has the possibility of entering in the "second <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span>", that is, after the following full moon (August or beginning of September). He will then end his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span> a month after the others, but will not be at fault. However, he will not be able to benefit from the "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kathina</span> privileges" (see below).</p>
<h3>Taking refuge on entering the vassa</h3>
<p>The day of entering the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span>, each <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> recites a short formula indicating that he will spend the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span> at the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vihāra</span> where he is. This then implies that the latter has chosen the place where he will reside during the whole of the three months of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span>. To do this, he will say in Pali (three times in succession):</p>
<p><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">"imasmiṃ vihāre imaṃ temāsaṃ vassaṃ upemi"</span><br />
"I will reside in this <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vihāra</span> (monastery) during the three months of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span> (rains season)."</p>
<h3>Invitation at the conclusion of the vassa (pavāraṇā)</h3>
<p>On the last day of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span>, each <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> recites a formula, in Pali (three times in succession), which is an invitation to all the members of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> to make comments on the offences that he has committed:</p>
<p><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">"saṃghaṃ bhante pavāremi, diṭṭhena vā sutena vā parisaṅkāya vā, vadantu maṃ āyasmanto anukampaṃ upādāya, passanto paṭikarissāmi." " dutiyampi... tatiyampi..."</span><br />
"Venerables, if you have seen, heard or suspected any faults whatsoever in me, I invite you to admonish me as required." " For the second time... For the third time..."</p>
<h3>The kathina</h3>
<p>The period starting on the day of the full moon marking the end of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span>, until the following full moon, is called the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kathina</span>.</p>
<p><strong>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kathina</span> privileges</strong>, which are five in number, are expressed by flexibilities in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span>. These are valid during the whole month of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kathina</span>. The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who has observed his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span> without breaking it can benefit from them:</p>
<ol>
<li>he can be distanced &ndash; by about 1.20 metres or more &ndash; from his robes at dawn;</li>
<li>he can leave the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vihāra</span> after noon without asking for consent from another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>;</li>
<li>he can accept an invitation (even if addressed to more than three <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>) for a meal that has been formulated incorrectly;</li>
<li>he is authorised to keep an additional robe &ndash; not determined &ndash; for more than ten days;the "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kathina</span> robe", offered to the entire <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>, can be shared with every <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> in the monastery (this is not always obligatory, except for those who have observed the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span> right until the end.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kathina</span> takes place in a great ceremony during which the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> of the monastery gather at the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīmā</span> to proceed to the presentation of the "<strong><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kathina</span> robe</strong>". At this time, no lay person &ndash; and no <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇera</span> &ndash; is allowed in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīmā</span>. After agreement, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> presents the famous <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kathina</span> robe to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who has shown the most remarkable conduct, and who, <em>a fortiori</em>, must not have broken the observance of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vassa</span>. According to tradition, this robe will have been sewn during the night by the villagers, before being offered to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> for the occasion. The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> to whom this is presented can keep it in addition to his own robe, during the whole month of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kathina</span>. However, he will have to share it with the other <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> beneficiary of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">kathina</span> privileges.</p>

<ul class="lfl">
<li>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> are obliged to shave <strong>the head</strong> and, if present, "the hairs that the women lack", i.e. <strong>the beard</strong>. Other hairy parts are not shaved. The maximum length allowed for hair and beard is two fingers. </li>
<li>Outside the precinct of the monastery, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is not allowed to wear <strong>sandals</strong> (or shoes). When accepting an offering, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> should never have footwear on. Footwear is a sign of wealth and comfort, which the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> are supposed to renounce. Besides, this forces them to keep the sight constantly lowered, permitting them to remain always attentive and preventing them from being distracted by the surroundings. </li>
<li>Outside the precinct of the monastery, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is not allowed to carry a <strong>parasol</strong>. In case of rain, umbrellas are tolerated. </li>
<li>The Buddha strictly forbade the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> to make use of <strong>astrology</strong>, numerology, palm reading, amulets, etc. </li>
<li>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must <strong>not water</strong> a tree (or a plant) that produces ornamental flowers or edible fruits. He must not even wash himself or shower near it, hoping to water it in this way. However, he can water a tree that provides shade or which serves as a fence. </li>
<li>It is not proper for a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> to transmit <strong>messages</strong> for any person except a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sāmaṇera</span>, someone who offers food to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>, his mother, his father or those persons who carry out various tasks on behalf of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> (sweeping, table service etc.) </li>
<li>If a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> needs to acquire something and there is no <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyaka</span> in the immediate vicinity, he is authorised to do a <strong>round in the afternoon</strong>, stopping in silence in front of the houses (as during the food round in the morning). He can communicate his needs only if anyone asks him, if not, he continues his way and stands in front of another house. </li>
<li>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must avoid all forms of distraction and any futile action or word. He must watch his speech, avoiding vulgarities. In addressing anyone, he must be polite and measured in every single word. He must be vigilant to keep always a proper distance from lay people, he must not shake their hand or treat them informally. When a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> goes to the toilet, he is obliged to be restrained and silent. In anything he does, his conduct must be blameless. </li>
