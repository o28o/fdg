<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Then the brahmin Jāṇussoṇī approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Master Gotama, we brahmins give gifts and perform the memorial rites for the dead<span class="note" id="n2169"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2169] Pāli: <i>saddhāni</i>; Skt <i>śrāddhāni</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">SED</a> sv <i>śrāddha</i> says: "A ceremony in honour and for the benefit of dead relatives observed with great strictness at various fixed periods and on occasions of rejoicing as well as mourning by the surviving relatives (these ceremonies are performed by the daily offering of water and on stated occasions by the offering of <i>piṇḍas</i> or balls of rice and meal to three paternal and three maternal forefathers, i.e., to father, grandfather, and great grandfather; it should be borne in mind that a <i>śrāddha</i> is not a funeral ceremony but a supplement to such a ceremony; it is an act of reverential homage to a deceased person performed by relatives, and is moreover supposed to supply the dead with strengthening nutriment after the performance of the previous funeral ceremonies has endowed them with ethereal bodies; indeed, until those <i>anteyeṣṭi</i> or ‘funeral rites’ have been performed, and until the succeeding first <i>śrāddha</i> has been celebrated the deceased relative is a <i>preta</i> or restless, wandering ghost, and has no real body … ; it is not until the first <i>śrāddha</i> has taken place that he attains a position among the <i>pitṛs</i> or Divine Fathers in their blissful abode called <i>Pitṛ-loka</i>, and the <i>śrāddha</i> is most desirable and efficacious when performed by a son … )."</span></span></span> with the thought: ‘Let our gift be of benefit to our departed relatives and family members. Let our departed relatives and family members partake of our gift.’ Can our gift, Master Gotama, actually be of benefit to our departed relatives and family members? Can our departed relatives and family members actually partake of our gift?"</p>

<p>"On a right occasion, brahmin, it can be of benefit, not on a wrong occasion."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"But, Master Gotama, what is a right occasion and what is a wrong occasion?"</p>

<p>"Here, brahmin, someone destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, speaks divisively, speaks harshly, indulges in idle chatter; he is full of longing, has a mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in hell.<span class="note" id="n2170"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2170] It is presumably the passages on the ten unwholesome and wholesome courses of kamma that explain the inclusion of this sutta in the Tens.</span></span></span> He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of the hell-beings. This is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Someone else destroys life … and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the animal realm. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of animals. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Still another abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, from divisive <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.270"></a> speech, from harsh speech, from idle chatter; he is without longing, of good will, and holds right view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with human beings. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of human beings. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Still another abstains from the destruction of life … and holds right view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with the devas. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of devas. This, too, is a wrong occasion, when the gift is not of benefit to one living there.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Still another destroys life … and holds wrong view. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the sphere of afflicted spirits. He sustains himself and subsists there on the food of afflicted spirits, or else he sustains himself there on what his friends, companions, relatives, or family members in this world offer to him. This is a right occasion, when the gift is of benefit to one living there."</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"But, Master Gotama, who partakes of the gift if that deceased relative or family member has not been reborn in that place?"</p>

<p>"Other departed relatives or family members who have been reborn<span class="note" id="n2171"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2171] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> <i>anuppannā</i> should be corrected to <i>upapannā</i>, the reading in Be and Ee and clearly required by the context.</span></span></span> in that place partake of the gift."</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"But, Master Gotama, who partakes of the gift if neither that deceased relative or family member nor any others have been reborn in that place?"</p>

<p>"Over this long stretch of time <span class="add">in saṁsāra</span>, brahmin, it is impossible and inconceivable for that place to be devoid of <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.271"></a> one's departed relatives and family members. Further, for the donor too it is not fruitless."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Does Master Gotama posit <span class="add">the value of giving</span> even on the wrong occasion?"<span class="note" id="n2172"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2172] <i>Aṭṭhānepi bhavaṁ gotamo parikappaṁ vadati</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "(By this) he asks: ‘When it is the wrong occasion (for sharing the merit of giving), does Master Gotama proclaim the fruitfulness of giving to that relative?’ For the brahmin held the belief that the donor does not gain any fruit of a gift given thus. But the Blessed One, having acknowledged his question, shows: ‘The donor gains the fruit of his gift wherever he is reborn, in any place where he is sustained by his meritorious fruits.’"</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>"Brahmin, I posit <span class="add">the value of giving</span> even on the wrong occasion.</p>

<p>"Here, brahmin, someone destroys life, takes what is not given, engages in sexual misconduct, speaks falsehood, speaks divisively, speaks harshly, indulges in idle chatter; he is full of longing, has a mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. He gives an ascetic or a brahmin food and drink; clothing and a vehicle; garlands, scents, and unguents; bedding, dwellings, and lighting. With the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in companionship with elephants. There he gains food and drink, garlands and various ornaments.</p>
