<p><span class="parno">1</span>“Mendicants, I don’t say that intentional deeds that have been performed and accumulated are eliminated without being experienced. And that may be in the present life, or in the next life, or in some subsequent period. And I don’t say that suffering is ended without experiencing intentional deeds that have been performed and accumulated.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Now, there are three kinds of corruption and failure of bodily action that have unskillful intention, with suffering as their outcome and result. There are four kinds of corruption and failure of verbal action that have unskillful intention, with suffering as their outcome and result. There are three kinds of corruption and failure of mental action that have unskillful intention, with suffering as their outcome and result.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>And what are the three kinds of corruption and failure of bodily action? </p>

<p>It’s when a certain person kills living creatures. They’re violent, bloody-handed, a hardened killer, merciless to living beings.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>They steal. With the intention to commit theft, they take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>They commit sexual misconduct. They have sex with women who have their mother, father, both mother and father, brother, sister, relatives, or clan as guardian. They have sex with a woman who is protected on principle, or who has a husband, or whose violation is punishable by law, or even one who has been garlanded as a token of betrothal.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>These are the three kinds of corruption and failure of bodily action.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>And what are the four kinds of corruption and failure of verbal action? </p>

<p>It’s when a certain person lies. They’re summoned to a council, an assembly, a family meeting, a guild, or to the royal court, and asked to bear witness: ‘Please, mister, say what you know.’ Not knowing, they say ‘I know.’ Knowing, they say ‘I don’t know.’ Not seeing, they say ‘I see.’ And seeing, they say ‘I don’t see.’ So they deliberately lie for the sake of themselves or another, or for some trivial worldly reason.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>They speak divisively. They repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. And so they divide those who are harmonious, supporting division, delighting in division, loving division, speaking words that promote division.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>They speak harshly. They use the kinds of words that are cruel, nasty, hurtful, offensive, bordering on anger, not leading to immersion.</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>They indulge in talking nonsense. Their speech is untimely, and is neither factual nor beneficial. It has nothing to do with the teaching or the training. Their words have no value, and are untimely, unreasonable, rambling, and pointless.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>And what are the three kinds of corruption and failure of mental action? </p>

<p>It’s when someone is covetous. They covet the wealth and belongings of others: ‘Oh, if only their belongings were mine!’</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>They have ill will and hateful intentions: ‘May these sentient beings be killed, slaughtered, slain, destroyed, or annihilated!’</p>

<hr>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>They have wrong view. Their perspective is distorted: ‘There’s no meaning in giving, sacrifice, or offerings. There’s no fruit or result of good and bad deeds. There’s no afterlife. There’s no obligation to mother and father. No beings are reborn spontaneously. And there’s no ascetic or brahmin who is well attained and practiced, and who describes the afterlife after realizing it with their own insight.’</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>It’s like throwing loaded dice: they always fall the right side up. In the same way, when their body breaks up, after death, sentient beings are reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell because of these three kinds of corruption and failure of bodily action, these four kinds of corruption and failure of verbal action, or these three kinds of corruption and failure of mental action that have unskillful intention, with suffering as their outcome and result.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>And what are the three kinds of successful bodily action? </p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>They don’t steal. They don’t, with the intention to commit theft, take the wealth or belongings of others from village or wilderness.</p>
