<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>"Bhikkhus, I do not say that there is a termination of volitional kamma<span class="note" id="n2180"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2180] The text has the genitive plural <i>sañcetanikānaṁ kammānaṁ</i>. Out of deference to established English usage, I have used the singular "kamma." In view of the fact that <i>kamma</i> is by definition volitional <i>(cetanā ‘haṁ bhikkhave kammaṁ vadāmi)</i>, "volitional kamma" sounds redundant, but I follow the Pāli. Apparently the text is playing off two meanings of <i>kamma</i>, the literal meaning of "deed, action" and the extended meaning of a deed with the capacity to produce ethically determined fruits. The former meaning, perhaps, is accentuated by <i>kata</i>, "done," the latter by <i>upacita</i>, "accumulated, stored up" as well as by the reference to the time periods when it can ripen.</span></span></span> that has been done and accumulated so long as one has not experienced <span class="add">its results</span>, and that may be in this very life, or in the <span class="add">next</span> rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion. But I do not say that there is making an end of suffering so long as one has not experienced <span class="add">the results of</span> volitional kamma that has been done and accumulated.<span class="note" id="n2181"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2181] On the threefold ripening of kamma, see note <a href="an3.34.html#n372">372</a>. The Buddha’s statement that there is no termination of volitional kamma so long as one has not experienced its results seems to contradict one of the main premises of his teaching, namely, that to attain liberation—”to make an end of suffering”—one need not experience the results of all the kamma one has accumulated in the past. This tenet (at least according to the Nikāyas) was proposed by the Jains, as stated at <a href="../mn/mn14.html#p16">MN&nbsp;14.17</a>, I 92,35–93,10; <a href="../mn/mn101.html#p11">MN&nbsp;101.10</a>, II 218,1–12. However, since the cycle of rebirths is “without discoverable beginning” <i>(anamatagga saṃsāra),</i> and in this long stretch we have all accumulated an immensity of kamma, it would virtually require infinite time to exhaust such kamma by experiencing its results. The Buddha taught that the key to liberation was not the eradication of past kamma (whether by experiencing its results or by austerities) but the elimination of the defilements. Arahants, by terminating the defilements, extinguish the potential for ripening of all their past kamma beyond the residue that might ripen in their final life. Mp explains the text’s statement as having an implicit meaning: “This is intended to show that as long as saṃsāra continues, if there is kamma that has acquired the capacity to ripen <i>(paṭiladdhavipākārahakamma)</i> ‘there is no place on earth where one might escape an evil deed’” (the citation, <i>na vijjati so jagatippadeso, yatthaṭṭhito mucceyya pāpakammā,</i> is from <a href="../dhp/dhp116-128.html#p127">Dhp&nbsp;127</a>). The point, in other words, is not that all kamma created will have to ripen, but that any kamma created and accumulated retains the potential to ripen as long as one wanders on in the cycle of rebirths.

<br class="half">A Chinese parallel of <a href="../an/an10.219.html">AN10.219</a>, <a href="an0-abbr.html">MĀ 15</a> (T I 437b<small>24</small> –438b<small>11</small>), opens with a similar declaration as <a href="../an/an10.217.html">AN10.217</a>. The statement (at T I 437b<small>26 — 28</small>) reads in translation: "If one has done a past kamma, I say that one must experience its result: one experiences it either in the present life or in a future life. But if one has not done a past kamma, I say that one will not experience its result" (<img alt="" src="images/000094.jpg" class="calibre127"/>). The Chinese parallel offers only two alternatives for the time of ripening and lacks anything corresponding to the problematic assertion, "I do not say that there is making an end of suffering so long as one has not experienced (the results of) volitional kamma that has been done and accumulated."</span></span></span></p>
