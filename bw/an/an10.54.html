<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>"Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu who is not skilled in the ways of others’ minds <span class="add">should train</span>: ‘I will be skilled in the ways of my own mind.’ It is in this way that you should train yourselves.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"And how is a bhikkhu skilled in the ways of his own mind? It is just as if a woman or a man—young, youthful, and fond of ornaments—would look at her or his own facial reflection in a clean bright mirror or in a bowl of clear water. If they see any dust or blemish there, they will make an effort to remove it. But if they do not see any dust or blemish there, they will be glad about it, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.99"></a> and their wish fulfilled, they will think, ‘How fortunate for me that I’m clean!’</p>

<p>"So too, bhikkhus, self-examination is very helpful for a bhikkhu <span class="add">to grow</span> in wholesome qualities:<span class="note" id="n2063"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2063] The following self-examination is modeled on <a href="../an/an4.93.html">AN4.93</a>.</span></span></span> ‘Do I gain internal serenity of mind or not? Do I gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena or not?’</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>(1) "If, by such self-examination, a bhikkhu knows: ‘I gain internal serenity of mind but not the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,’ he should base himself on internal serenity of mind and make an effort to gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena. Then, some time later, he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>(2) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows: ‘I gain the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena but not internal serenity of mind,’ he should base himself on the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and make an effort to gain internal serenity of mind. Then, some time later, he gains both the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena and internal serenity of mind.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>(3) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows: ‘I gain neither internal serenity of mind nor the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,’ he should put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesome qualities. Just as one whose clothes or head had caught fire would put forth extraordinary desire, effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to extinguish <span class="add">the fire on</span> his clothes or head, so that bhikkhu should put forth extraordinary desire, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.100"></a> effort, zeal, enthusiasm, indefatigability, mindfulness, and clear comprehension to obtain both those wholesome qualities. Then, some time later, he gains both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>(4) "But if, by such self-examination, he knows: ‘I gain both internal serenity of mind and the higher wisdom of insight into phenomena,’ he should base himself on those same wholesome qualities and make a further effort to reach the destruction of the taints.</p>
