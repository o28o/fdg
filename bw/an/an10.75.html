<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasālā, where he sat down on the seat prepared for him. Then the female lay disciple Migasālā approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Bhante Ānanda, just how should this <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.138"></a> teaching of the Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life? My father Purāṇa was celibate, living apart, abstaining from sexual intercourse, the common person's practice. When he died, the Blessed One declared: ‘He attained to the state of a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group <span class="add">of devas</span>.’ My paternal uncle Isidatta<span class="note" id="n2092"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2092] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> <i>pettā pi yo</i>; Be <i>pitāmaho</i>, Ee <i>pettā piyo</i>. PED explains <i>pitāmahā</i> (under <i>pitar)</i> as "grandfather," which seems unlikely here. PED, under <i>pettāpiya</i> (epic Skt <i>pitṛvya)</i>, gives "father's brother, paternal uncle," which can thus support Ce and Ee if the spaces are eliminated. See too pp. 1758–59, note 1330.</span></span></span> was not celibate but lived a contented married life. When he died, the Blessed One also declared: ‘He attained to the state of a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group <span class="add">of devas</span>.’</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Bhante Ānanda, just how should this teaching of the Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life?"</p>

<p>"It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it."</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">4-7</span>Then, when the Venerable Ānanda had received almsfood at Migasālā's house, he rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Here, Bhante, in the morning, I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasālā ….<a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.139"></a> <span class="add">all as above, down to</span> … When she asked me this, I replied: ‘It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it.’"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span><span class="add">The Blessed One said:</span> "Who, indeed, is the female lay follower Migasālā, a foolish, incompetent woman with a woman's intellect? And who are those <span class="add">who have</span> the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior?<span class="note" id="n2093"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2093] I take <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> <i> –ñāṇo</i> here to be a misprint for <i> –ñāṇe</i>, which occurs in the repetition of the statement toward the end of the sutta.

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"There are, Ānanda, these ten types of persons found existing in the world. What ten?</p>

<p>(1) "Here, Ānanda, there is one person who is immoral and does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, where that immorality of his ceases without remainder.<span class="note" id="n2094"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2094] <i>Dussīlyaṁ aparisesaṁ nirujjhati</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "Here, the five kinds of immorality are abandoned by the path of stream-entry; the ten (courses of unwholesome kamma), by the path of arahantship. At the moment of fruition they are said to have been abandoned. By <i>nirujjhati</i> the text here refers to the moment of fruition. A worldling breaks virtuous behavior in five ways: by committing a <i>pārājika</i> offense, by giving up the training, by joining another sect, by reaching arahantship, and by death. The first three lead to the decline of development, the fourth to its growth, and the fifth neither to decline nor growth. But how is virtuous behavior broken by reaching arahantship? Because a worldling can have extremely wholesome virtuous behavior, but the path of arahantship leads to the destruction of wholesome and unwholesome kamma; thus it is broken in that way." This, it should be pointed out, is explained from the Abhidhamma standpoint, according to which an arahant's actions, being mere activities <i>(kiriya)</i> without kammic result, are not classified as either wholesome or unwholesome. In the language of the suttas, however, they would be described as extremely wholesome.</span></span></span> And he has not listened <span class="add">to the teachings</span>, become learned <span class="add">in them</span>, penetrated <span class="add">them</span> by view, and he does not attain temporary liberation.
