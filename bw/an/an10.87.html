<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus with reference to the bhikkhu Kalandaka:<span class="note" id="n2105"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2105] This is the name in <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a>. Ee reads <i>kālakaṁ</i>, which could also be taken as a proper name. But Be has <i>kālakataṁ</i>, which means "one who has died."</span></span></span> "Bhikkhus!"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied.</p>

<p>The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is a maker of disciplinary issues and he does not speak in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues. When a bhikkhu is a maker of disciplinary issues and does not speak in praise of the settlement of disciplinary issues, this is a quality that does not lead to affection, respect, esteem, accord, or unity.<span class="note" id="n2106"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2106] <i>Ayampi dhammo na piyatāya na garutāya na bhāvanāya na sāmaññāya na ekībhāvāya saṁvattati</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses <i><b>na sāmaññāya</b></i> with <i>na samaṇadhammabhāvāya</i> "nor to the state (or duty) of an ascetic." <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> obviously takes <i>sāmañña</i> to be derived from <i>samaṇa</i>. However, the word <i>sāmaññā</i> is also an abstract noun from <i>samāna</i>, meaning "the same" or "similar," and I believe this is the sense intended here. I translate it as "accord," which agrees well with the next word, <i>ekībhāvāya</i>. See too <a href="an8.2.html#n1623">AN8.2, n.&nbsp;1623</a>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> does not gloss <i>bhāvanāya</i>, but in commenting on <a href="../an/an8.2.html#n1623">AN8.2</a> it allows two alternatives, "meditative development" and "esteem for virtues." In this context I have taken the latter to be intended. A Chinese parallel, MĀ 94, at T I 576a<small>23–25</small>, has for <i>bhāvanāya</i> 
<img alt="" src="images/000011.jpg" class="calibre125"/>, "nor to meditative development"; and for <i>sāmaññā,</i> <img alt="" src="images/000056.jpg" class="calibre126"/>, "nor to obtaining the ascetic state." Despite this agreement between <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> and MĀ 94, I still think it possible that the words were misunderstood at an early period and prefer my rendering.</span></span></span> <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.165"></a></p>
