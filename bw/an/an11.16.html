The word for city itself is <i>nagara</i>.

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then he approached a certain bhikkhu in the Cock's Park and asked him: "Bhante, where is the Venerable Ānanda staying now? I want to see him."</p>

<p>"He is staying at Beluvagāmaka near Vesālī, householder."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>When the householder Dasama had completed his business at Pāṭaliputta, he went to the Venerable Ānanda at Beluvagāmaka near Vesālī. He paid homage to the Venerable Ānanda, sat down to one side, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.343"></a> and said to him:</p>

<p>"Bhante Ānanda, is there any one thing properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, such that if a bhikkhu dwells diligent, ardent, and resolute in it, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are destroyed, and he attains the as-yet-unattained unsurpassed security from bondage?"</p>

<p>"There is, householder."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"And what is it?"</p>

<hr>
<p>(1) "Here, householder, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. He considers this and understands it thus: ‘This first jhāna is constructed and produced by volition. But whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation.’ If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints because of that lust for the Dhamma, because of that delight in the Dhamma,<span class="note" id="n2226"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2226] <i>Ten’eva dhammarāgena dhammanandiyā</i>.

For if one is able to exhaust all desire and lust for serenity and insight, one becomes an arahant. If one cannot do so, one becomes a non-returner. Because one has not abandoned desire and lust for serenity and insight, through the volition of the fourth jhāna one is reborn in the pure abodes. This is the general explanation among the teachers."</span></span></span> then, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world.</p>

<p>"This is one thing properly expounded by the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One who knows and sees, such that if a bhikkhu dwells in it diligent, ardent, and resolute, his unliberated mind is liberated, his undestroyed taints are destroyed, and he attains the as-yet-unattained unsurpassed security from bondage. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.344"></a></p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>(2) "Again, householder, with the subsiding of thought and examination a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna … (3) … the third jhāna … (4) … the fourth jhāna …. He considers this and understands it thus: ‘This fourth jhāna is constructed and produced by volition. But whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation.’ If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints. But if he does not attain the destruction of the taints because of that lust for the Dhamma, because of that delight in the Dhamma, then, with the utter destruction of the five lower fetters, he becomes one of spontaneous birth, due to attain final nibbāna there without ever returning from that world.</p>

He considers this and understands it thus: ‘This liberation of the mind by loving-kindness is constructed and produced by volition. But whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation.’ If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints.

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>(6) "Again, householder, a bhikkhu dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion … (7) … with a mind imbued with altruistic joy … (8) … with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will.

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>(9) "Again, householder, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of forms, with the passing away of perceptions of sensory impingement, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, (perceiving) ‘space is infinite,’ a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the base of the infinity of space. He considers this and understands it thus: ‘This attainment of the base of the infinity of space is constructed and produced by volition. But whatever is constructed and produced by volition is impermanent, subject to cessation.’ If he is firm in this, he attains the destruction of the taints.

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>When this was said, the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhakanagara said to the Venerable Ānanda: "Bhante Ānanda, just as if a man seeking one entrance to a hidden treasure all at once found eleven entrances to that treasure, so too, while I was seeking one door to the deathless, I have all at once gotten to hear eleven doors to the deathless.<span class="note" id="n2228"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2228] The eleven "doors to the deathless" are the four jhānas, the four immeasurables, and the lower three formless attainments. They are used as bases to develop insight and attain arahantship.</span></span></span> Just as if a man had a house with eleven doors <a class="pts_pn" id="an.v.347"></a> and when that house caught on fire, he could flee to safety through any of these eleven doors, so I can flee to safety through any of these eleven doors to the deathless. Bhante, these members of other sects seek a fee for their teachers, so why shouldn’t I make an offering to the Venerable Ānanda?"</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Then the householder Dasama of Aṭṭhakanagara assembled the Saṅgha of bhikkhus from Pāṭaliputta and Vesālī, and with his own hands he served and satisfied them with various kinds of good food. He presented a pair of cloths to each bhikkhu and a set of three robes to the Venerable Ānanda. And he had a dwelling worth five hundred<span class="note" id="n2229"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.2229] That is, five hundred <i>kahāpaṇas</i>.</span></span></span> built for the Venerable Ānanda.</p>
