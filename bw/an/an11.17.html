<p><span class="parno">1</span>“Mendicants, a cowherd with eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle. What eleven? It’s when a cowherd doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t smoke out pests, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in pastures, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to the bulls who are fathers and leaders of the herd. A cowherd with these eleven factors can’t maintain and expand a herd of cattle.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>In the same way, a mendicant with eleven qualities can’t achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training. What eleven? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t know form, is unskilled in characteristics, doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs, doesn’t dress wounds, doesn’t smoke out pests, doesn’t know the ford, doesn’t know satisfaction, doesn’t know the trail, is not skilled in pastures, milks dry, and doesn’t show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>And how does a mendicant not know form? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand that all form is the four primary elements, or form derived from the four primary elements. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know form.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>And how is a mendicant not skilled in characteristics? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t understand that a fool is characterized by their deeds, and an astute person is characterized by their deeds. That’s how a mendicant isn’t skilled in characteristics.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>And how does a mendicant not pick out flies’ eggs? It’s when a mendicant tolerates a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen. They don’t give it up, get rid of it, eliminate it, and obliterate it. They tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen. They don’t give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t pick out flies’ eggs.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>And how does a mendicant not dress wounds? When a mendicant sees a sight with their eyes, they get caught up in the features and details. Since the faculty of sight is left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion become overwhelming. They don’t practice restraint, they don’t protect the faculty of sight, and they don’t achieve its restraint. When they hear a sound with their ears … When they smell an odor with their nose … When they taste a flavor with their tongue … When they feel a touch with their body … When they know a thought with their mind, they get caught up in the features and details. Since the faculty of the mind is left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion become overwhelming. They don’t practice restraint, they don’t protect the faculty of the mind, and they don’t achieve its restraint. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t dress wounds.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>And how does a mendicant not smoke out pests? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t teach others the Dhamma in detail as they learned and memorized it. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t smoke out pests.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>And how does a mendicant not know the ford? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t from time to time go up to those mendicants who are very learned — knowledgeable in the scriptures, who have memorized the teachings, the texts on monastic training, and the outlines — and ask them questions: ‘Why, sir, does it say this? What does that mean?’ Those venerables don’t clarify what is unclear, reveal what is obscure, and dispel doubt regarding the many doubtful matters. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know the ford.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>And how does a mendicant not know satisfaction? It’s when a mendicant, when the teaching and training proclaimed by the Realized One are being taught, finds no joy in the meaning and the teaching, and finds no joy connected with the teaching. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know satisfaction.</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>And how does a mendicant not know the trail? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand the noble eightfold path. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t know the trail.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>And how is a mendicant not skilled in pastures? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t truly understand the four kinds of mindfulness meditation. That’s how a mendicant is not skilled in pastures.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>And how does a mendicant milk dry? It’s when a mendicant is invited by a householder to accept robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick. But they don’t know moderation in accepting. That’s how a mendicant milks dry.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>And how does a mendicant not show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t consistently treat senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha with kindness by way of body, speech, and mind, both in public and in private. That’s how a mendicant doesn’t show extra respect to senior mendicants of long standing, long gone forth, fathers and leaders of the Saṅgha.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>A mendicant with these eleven qualities can’t achieve growth, improvement, or maturity in this teaching and training.</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>And how does a mendicant pick out flies’ eggs? It’s when a mendicant doesn’t tolerate a sensual, malicious, or cruel thought that has arisen, but gives it up, gets rid of it, eliminates it, and exterminates it. They don’t tolerate any bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen, but give them up, get rid of them, eliminate them, and obliterate them. That’s how a mendicant picks out flies’ eggs.</p>

If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming. For this reason, they practice restraint, protecting the faculty of sight, and achieving its restraint.
