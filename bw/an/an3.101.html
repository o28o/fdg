<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>"Bhikkhus, there are gross defilements of gold: soil, grit, and gravel. Now the soil remover or his apprentice first pours the gold into a trough and washes, rinses, and cleans it. When that has been removed and eliminated, there still remain middle-size defilements in the gold: fine grit and coarse sand.</p>

<p>The soil remover or his apprentice washes, rinses, and cleans it again. When that has been removed and eliminated, there still remain subtle defilements in the gold: fine sand and black dust.</p>

<p>So the soil remover or his apprentice washes, rinses, and cleans it again. When that has been removed and eliminated, only grains of gold remain.</p>

<p>"The goldsmith or his apprentice now pours the gold into a melting pot, and fans it, melts it, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.254"></a> and smelts it. But even when this has been done, the gold is not yet settled and the dross has not yet been entirely removed.<span class="note" id="n555"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.555] I follow <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> here: <i>dhamati sandhamati niddhamati. Taṁ hoti jātarūpaṁ dhantaṁ sandhantaṁ niddhantaṁ, anihitaṁ anikkhittakasāvaṁ.</i> Be has the same up to <i>niddhantaṁ</i>, but it then omits <i>anihitaṁ</i> and reads <i>aniddhantakasāvaṁ</i> where Ce has <i>anikkhittakasāvaṁ</i>. Ee allows a bracketed alternative: <i>dhamati sandhamati (na) niddhamati. Taṁ hoti jātarūpaṁ dhantaṁ sandhantaṁ aniddhantaṁ, anihitaṁ aninnītakasāvaṁ.</i> An older Sri Lankan edition mentioned in a note to Ce also has <i>aninnītakasāvaṁ</i>.</span></span></span> The gold is not yet malleable, wieldy, and luminous, but still brittle and not properly fit for work.</p>

<p>"But as the goldsmith or his apprentice continues to fan, melt, and smelt the gold, a time comes when the gold is settled and the dross has been entirely removed, so that the gold becomes malleable, wieldy, and luminous, pliant and properly fit for work. Then whatever kind of ornament the goldsmith wishes to make from it—whether a bracelet, earrings, a necklace, or a golden garland—he can achieve his purpose.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span><a class="me_eng" id="2"></a>"So too, bhikkhus, when a bhikkhu is devoted to the higher mind, (1) there are in him gross defilements: bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct.

When this has been done, (2) there remain in him middling defilements: sensual thoughts, thoughts of ill will, and thoughts of harming. An earnest, capable bhikkhu abandons, dispels, terminates, and obliterates them. When this has been done, (3) there remain in him subtle defilements: thoughts about his relations,<span class="note" id="n556"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.556] I read with <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> and Be <i>ñātivitakko</i>, as against Ee <i>jātivitakko</i>, "thoughts about (social) class."</span></span></span> thoughts about his country, and thoughts about his reputation.<span class="note" id="n557"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.557] <i>Anavaññattipaṭisaṁyutto vitakko</i>.

Mp says that <i>paṭippassaddhaṁ</i> and <i>paṭippassaddhi</i> are one in meaning <i>(idaṁ atthato ekaṁ)</i>, proposing two resolutions: "It is gained by the full tranquilizing of defilements, or it has gained the full tranquilization of defilements <i>(kilesapaṭippassaddhiyā laddhattā kilesapaṭippassaddhibhāvaṁ vā laddhattā)</i>, thus it is <i>paṭippassaddhiladdho</i>."</span></span></span> not attained to unification, but is reined in and checked by forcefully suppressing (the defilements).<span class="note" id="n560"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.560] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> and Ee <i>sasaṅkhāraniggayhavāritavato</i>; in place of <i> –vato</i> Be reads the termination as <i> –gato</i>. I interpret <i>sasaṅkhāra</i> as "forceful" (lit. "with exertion"); <i>niggayha</i> as "having suppressed"; <i>vārita</i> as "reined in"; and (following Ce) <i> –vato</i> as "checked." A rendering based on the Be variant might be: "but is reached when <span class="add">the defilements</span> are reined in by forcefully suppressing (them)."</span></span></span></p>

<p>"But, bhikkhus, there comes a time when his mind becomes internally steady, composed, unified, and concentrated.

Vism 376,<small>28</small> – 378,<small>2</small>, Ppn 12.14–19, explains the basis for the direct knowledges to be the concentrated mind that has acquired eight qualities: namely, it is (1) purified, (2) cleansed, (3) unblemished, (4) rid of defilement, (5) malleable, (6) wieldy, (7) steady, and (8) attained to imperturbability.
