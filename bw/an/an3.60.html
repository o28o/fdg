<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Then the brahmin Saṅgārava approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him …. Then, sitting to one side, the brahmin Saṅgārava said this to the Blessed One:</p>

<p>"Master Gotama, we brahmins sacrifice and enjoin others to offer sacrifices. Now both one who himself sacrifices and one who enjoins others to offer sacrifices engage in a meritorious practice that extends to many people, that is, one based on sacrifice. But one who leaves his family and goes forth from the household life into homelessness tames only himself, calms only himself, and leads to nibbāna only himself. In such a case, he engages in a meritorious practice that extends to only one person, that is, one based on going forth."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Well then, brahmin, I will question you about this matter. You should answer as you see fit. What do you think, brahmin? Here, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, an Enlightened One, a Blessed One. He says thus: ‘Come, this is the path, this is the way. Practicing in accordance with it, I have realized for myself with direct knowledge the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life<span class="note" id="n421"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.421] <i>Anuttaraṁ brahmacariyogadhaṁ</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "Nibbāna is ‘the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life,’ the supreme support for the spiritual life, which is the path to arahantship" <i>(arahattamaggasaṅkhātassa brahmacariyassa anuttaraṁ ogadhaṁ uttamapatiṭṭhābhūtaṁ nibbānaṁ)</i>. In <a href="../mn/mn44.html#p51">MN&nbsp;44.51</a>, I 304,<small>21–22</small>, <i>nibbānogadhaṁ</i> is used in conjunction with <i>nibbānaparāyanaṁ</i> and <i>nibbānapariyosānaṁ</i>, which suggests that the three terms are synonymous. It –a I 112,<small>11–12</small>, glosses <i>nibbānogadhagāmī</i> (the same phrase as in AN) with <i>nibbānasaṅkhātaṁ ogadhaṁ patiṭṭhaṁ pāraṁ gacchati</i> ("it goes to the far shore, the support, the culmination consisting in nibbāna"). This explanation, which is consistent with other commentaries, supports my rendering of <i>nibbānogadha</i> here as "culmination in nibbāna" rather than "the plunge into nibbāna," a rendering used by other translators. My rendering of <i>amatogadha</i> in CDB (as at <a href="../sn/sn45.139.html">SN&nbsp;45:139</a>, SN46.184, SN48.42, SN48.44, etc.) as "with the deathless as its ground" is not satisfactory. I am grateful to Vanarata for his comments on this term.</span></span></span> and make it known to others. Come, you too practice thus. Practicing in accordance with it, you too will realize for yourselves with direct knowledge the unsurpassed culmination of the spiritual life and dwell in it.’ Thus the teacher teaches this Dhamma and others <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.169"></a> practice accordingly. There are many hundreds, many thousands, many hundreds of thousands who do so.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>What do you think? When this is the case, is that act of going forth a meritorious practice that extends to one person or to many people?.</p>

<p>"When that is the case, Master Gotama, this is a meritorious practice that extends to many people, that is, one based on going forth."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the brahmin Saṅgārava: "Of these two practices, brahmin, which appeals to you more as being simpler and less harmful, and as being more fruitful and beneficial?.</p>

<p>Thereupon the brahmin Saṅgārava said to the Venerable Ānanda: "I consider Master Gotama and Master Ānanda worthy of veneration and praise."<span class="note" id="n422"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.422] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "He did not want to answer Ānanda's question, so he tried to turn the discussion aside with words of praise."</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>A second time the Venerable Ānanda said to the brahmin: "Brahmin, I am not asking you whom you consider worthy of veneration and praise. I am asking you which of those two practices appeals to you as being simpler and less harmful, and also as more fruitful and beneficial?"</p>

<p>But a second time the brahmin Saṅgārava replied: "I consider Master Gotama and Master Ānanda worthy of veneration and praise."</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>A third time the Venerable Ānanda said to the brahmin: "Brahmin, I am not asking you whom you consider worthy of veneration and praise. I am asking you which of those two practices appeals to you as being simpler and less harmful, and also as more fruitful and beneficial?.</p>

<p>But a third time the brahmin Saṅgārava replied: "I consider Master Gotama and Master Ānanda worthy of veneration and praise." <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.170"></a></p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then the Blessed One thought: "Even for a third time the brahmin Saṅgārava, on being asked a legitimate question by Ānanda, falters and does not answer. Let me release him." Then the Blessed One said to the brahmin Saṅgārava: "What conversation, brahmin, arose today among the king's retinue when they assembled and were sitting in the royal palace?"</p>

<p>"The conversation was this, Master Gotama: ‘Formerly there were fewer bhikkhus, but more who displayed superhuman wonders of psychic potency. But now there are more bhikkhus, but fewer who display superhuman wonders of psychic potency.’ This was the conversation that arose today among the king's retinue."</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"There are, brahmin, these three kinds of wonders. What three? The wonder of psychic potency, the wonder of mind-reading, and the wonder of instruction.<span class="note" id="n423"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.423] <i>Iddhipāṭihāriyaṁ ādesanāpāṭihāriyaṁ anusāsanīpāṭihāriyaṁ</i>. Also at <a href="../dn/dn11.html#p4">DN&nbsp;11.4–9</a>, I 212–14.</span></span></span></p>

<p>(1) "And what, brahmin, is the wonder of psychic potency? Here, a bhikkhu wields the various kinds of psychic potency: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world. This is called the wonder of psychic potency.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>(2) "And what, brahmin, is the wonder of mind-reading? There is one who, by means of some clue,<span class="note" id="n424"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.424] <i>Nimittena ādisati</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> explains it as if it means an unrelated clue in the environment, but it may be a gesture or facial expression—what we now call "body language"—that reveals to a skilled observer the other person's state of mind.</span></span></span> declares: ‘Your thought is thus, such is what you are thinking, your mind is in such and such a state.’ And even if he makes many declarations, they are exactly so and not otherwise.</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Again, someone does not declare <span class="add">the state of mind</span> on the basis of a clue, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.171"></a> but he hears the sound of people, spirits, or deities (speaking) and then declares: ‘Your thought is thus, such is what you are thinking, your mind is in such and such a state.’ And even if he makes many declarations, they are exactly so and not otherwise.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Again, someone does not declare <span class="add">the state of mind</span> on the basis of a mark, or by hearing the sound of people, spirits, or deities <span class="add">speaking</span>, but he hears the sound of the diffusion of thought<span class="note" id="n425"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.425] <i>Vitakkavipphārasaddaṁ sutvā</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "Having heard the sound of those muttering while asleep or oblivious, which (sound) arises by the diffusion of thought." I suspect that Mp misses the point. Since the examples in the sutta proceed from the coarser to the subtler, this one should be subtler than its predecessor. I think that what is intended is a subtle sound supposedly emanated by thought but not expressed verbally.</span></span></span> as one is thinking and examining (some matter) and then declares: ‘Your thought is thus, such is what you are thinking, your mind is in such and such a state.’ And even if he makes many declarations, they are exactly so and not otherwise.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Again, someone does not declare (the state of mind) on the basis of a mark, or by hearing the sound of people, spirits, or deities (speaking), or by hearing the sound of the diffusion of thought as one is thinking and examining (some matter), but with his own mind he encompasses the mind of one who has attained concentration without thought and examination and he understands: ‘This person's mental activities are so disposed that immediately afterward he will think this thought.’<span class="note" id="n426"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.426] This must be referring to one in the second or higher jhānas.</span></span></span> And even if he makes many declarations, they are exactly so and not otherwise. This is called the wonder of mind-reading.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>(3) "And what, brahmin, is the wonder of instruction? Here, someone instructs (others) thus: ‘Think in this way and not in that way! Attend to this and not to that! Abandon this and enter and dwell in that!’ This is called the wonder of instruction.<span class="note" id="n427"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.427] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> gives examples: "Think thoughts of desirelessness, not thoughts of sensuality, etc. Attend to the idea of impermanence, etc., not to permanence, etc. Abandon lust for sensual pleasure and enter a world-transcending path and fruit."</span></span></span></p>

<p>"These, brahmin, are the three kinds of wonders. Of these three wonders, which appeals to you as the most excellent and sublime?"</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"Among these, Master Gotama, when someone performs this wonder by which he wields the various kinds of psychic potency … exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world, only the one who performs this wonder experiences it and it occurs only to him. This wonder seems to me like a magical trick.</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"Again, Master Gotama, when someone performs this wonder by which he declares another's state of mind on the basis of a clue … by hearing the sound of people, spirits, or deities … by hearing the sound of the diffusion of thought while he is thinking and examining (some matter) … by encompassing with his own mind the mind of one who has attained concentration that is without thought and examination such that he understands: <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.172"></a> ‘This person's mental activities are so disposed that immediately afterward he will think this thought,’ and, even if he makes many declarations, they are exactly so and not otherwise—again, only the one who performs this wonder experiences it and it occurs only to him. This wonder, too, seems to me like a magical trick.</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"But, Master Gotama, when someone performs this wonder by which he instructs (others) thus: ‘Think in this way and not in that way! Attend to this and not to that! Abandon this and enter and dwell in that!’—this wonder appeals to me as the most excellent and sublime of those three wonders.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"It is astounding and amazing, Master Gotama, how well this has been stated by Master Gotama! We consider Master Gotama to be one who can perform these three wonders. For Master Gotama wields the various kinds of psychic potency … exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world. Master Gotama encompasses with his own mind the mind of one who has attained concentration that is without thought and examination such that he understands: ‘This person's mental activities are so disposed that immediately afterward he will think this thought.’ And Master Gotama instructs (others) thus: ‘Think in this way and not in that way! Attend to this and not to that! Abandon this and enter and dwell in that!’"</p>

<p id="note428"><span class="parno">18</span>"Surely, brahmin, your words are prying and intrusive.<span class="note" id="n428"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.428] <i>Āsajja upanīya vācā bhāsitā</i>. <i>Āsajja</i> usually means "having attacked," but this meaning seems too strong here. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> merely paraphrases without giving much help: "The words you spoke hit upon my virtues and intrude on the domain of my virtues" <i>(mama guṇe ghaṭṭetvā mam’eva guṇānaṁ santikaṁ upanītā vācā bhāsitā)</i>. I therefore assume that the words, without being insulting, are considered inappropriate because they are making a personal inquiry.</span></span></span> Nevertheless, I will answer you. I do wield the various kinds of psychic potency … exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahmā world. I do encompass with my own mind the mind of one who has attained a state of concentration that is without thought and examination such that I understand: ‘This person's mental activities are so disposed that immediately afterward he will think this thought.’ And I do instruct (others) thus: ‘Think in this way and not in that way! Attend to this and not to that! Abandon this and enter and dwell in that!’"</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"But, Master Gotama, is there even one other bhikkhu apart from Master Gotama who can perform these three wonders?.</p>

<p>"There is not just one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, four hundred, or five hundred bhikkhus, but even more who can perform these three wonders..</p>

<p>"But where are those bhikkhus presently dwelling?" <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.173"></a></p>

<p>"Right here, brahmin, in this Saṅgha of bhikkhus."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"Excellent, Master Gotama! … Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."</p>
