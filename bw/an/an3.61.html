<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>"Bhikkhus, there are these three sectarian tenets<span class="note" id="n429"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.429] "Sectarian tenets" renders <i>titthāyatanāni</i>, lit. "bases of sects." The word <i>tittha</i> (Skt <i>tīrtha)</i>, which originally meant a ford in a river, was used to designate religious teachings, probably in the sense that these teachings provide a "ford" for crossing the stream of defilements and reaching the far shore of liberation (see <a href="../../mn34.html">MN&nbsp;34</a>, where this metaphor governs a short discourse). <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> explains that the sects <i>(tittha)</i> are the sixty-two views (see <a href="../dn/dn1.html#p53">DN&nbsp;1.1.29–3.29</a>, I 12–39); the founders of the sects <i>(titthakara)</i> are those who formulate those views; and the followers of the sects <i>(titthiya)</i> are those who approve of the views. The great teachers in Jainism are called in Skt <i>tīrthankara</i>.</span></span></span> which, when questioned, interrogated, and cross-examined by the wise, and taken to their conclusion, will eventuate in non-doing.<span class="note" id="n430"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.430] <i>Parampi gantvā akiriyāya saṇṭhahanti</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses <i>paraṁ</i> with <i>paramparā</i>, "lineage": "Even if they have gone to one of the three kinds of lineage, the lineage of teachers, the lineage of beliefs, and the lineage of (one's) individual existences" <i>(ācariyaparamparā laddhiparamparā attabhāvaparamparā ti etesu yaṁkiñci paramparaṁ gantvā pi)</i>. It is hard to see how this has any relevance to the context. Since <i>paraṁ</i> can also mean "later, further, afterward," it seems the point being conveyed is that these positions, if extended further, eventuate in non-doing. On the basis of this understanding, I render <i>parampi gantvā</i> as "taken to their conclusion." <i>Saṇṭhahanti</i> is, more literally, "stop at."</span></span></span> What are the three.</p>

<p>(1) "There are, bhikkhus, some ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: ‘Whatever this person experiences—whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure—all that is caused by what was done in the past.’ (2) There are other ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: ‘Whatever this person experiences—whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure—all that is caused by God's creative activity.’ (3) And there are still other ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: ‘Whatever this person experiences—whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure—all that occurs without a cause or condition.’<span class="note" id="n431"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.431] These are respectively the doctrines of the Jains, the theists, and non-causality, a doctrine elsewhere ascribed to Makkhali Gosāla (see <a href="../an/an1.319.html">AN1.319</a>, <a href="../an/an3.137.html">AN3.137</a>).</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>(1) "Bhikkhus, I approached those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view as this: ‘Whatever this person experiences—whether pleasure, pain, or neither-pain-nor-pleasure—all that is caused by past deeds,’<span class="note" id="n432"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.432] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "They hold that one experiences feelings exclusively because of kamma created in the past." In this connection, see SN <a >36:21</a>, IV 230–31, where the Buddha explains eight causes for illness or affliction, only one of which is the ripening of past kamma. Brahmāli writes: "The point here seems to be that each of these unwholesome ways of acting is related to particular feelings, and that those feelings (or experiences) can only be experienced through those acts. It follows that if your kamma is such that you have to experience the feelings connected with those bad acts, then you will have to perform them." The same point, with suitable changes, applies to the following two tenets, that of God's creative activity and non-causality. In each case, agents escape responsibility for their actions.</span></span></span> and I said to them: ‘Is it true that you venerable ones hold such a doctrine and view?’ When I ask them this, they affirm it. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.174"></a> Then I say to them: ‘In such a case, it is due to past deeds that you might destroy life, take what is not given, indulge in sexual activity, speak falsehood, utter divisive speech, speak harshly, indulge in idle chatter; that you might be full of longing, have a mind of ill will, and hold wrong view.’<span class="note" id="n433"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.433] At <a href="../mn/mn14.html#p14">MN&nbsp;14.14–16</a>, I 92–93, and <a href="../mn/mn101.html">MN&nbsp;101</a>, II 214–28, the Buddha challenges the Nigaṇṭhas with other arguments against their thesis that all feeling is due to past kamma.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Those who fall back on past deeds as the essential truth have no desire <span class="add">to do</span> what should be done and <span class="add">to avoid doing</span> what should not be done, nor do they make an effort in this respect. Since they do not apprehend as true and valid anything that should be done or should not be done, they are muddle-minded, they do not guard themselves, and even the personal designation ‘ascetic’ could not be legitimately applied to them. This was my first legitimate refutation of those ascetics and brahmins who hold such a doctrine and view.</p>

There are these six bases for contact: the eye as a base for contact, the ear as a base for contact, the nose as a base for contact, the tongue as a base for contact, the body as a base for contact, and the mind as a base for contact. When it was said: ‘"These are the six bases for contact": this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted … uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins,’ it is because of this that this was said.</p>

The word "feet" <i>(pāda)</i> is used here because <i>vicāra</i> originally meant "traveling around."</span></span></span> Having seen a form with the eye, one examines a form that is a basis for joy; one examines a form that is a basis for dejection; one examines a form that is a basis for equanimity. Having heard a sound with the ear … Having smelled an odour with the nose … Having tasted a taste with the tongue … Having felt a tactile object with the body … Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, one examines a mental phenomenon that is a basis for joy; one examines a mental phenomenon that is a basis for dejection; one examines a mental phenomenon that is a basis for equanimity. When it was said: ‘"These are the eighteen mental examinations": this, bhikkhus, is the Dhamma taught by me that is unrefuted … uncensured by wise ascetics and brahmins,’ it is because of this that this was said.</p>

In dependence on the six elements the descent of a <span class="add">future</span> embryo occurs.<span class="note" id="n437"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.437] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "Why does he begin in this way? For ease of understanding. For the Tathāgata wants to explain the revolving of the twelve conditions, so he shows the round by the term ‘descent of a (future) embryo’ <i>(gabbhassāvakkanti)</i>. For when the round has been shown by the descent of a <span class="add">future</span> embryo, what follows will be easy to understand. Whose six elements serve as the condition, the mother's or the father's? It is neither, but descent of a <span class="add">future</span> embryo occurs conditioned by the six elements of the being taking rebirth." Mp cites <a href="../mn/mn38.html#p92">MN&nbsp;38.92</a>, I 265,<small>35</small> –66,<small>6</small> (see too <a href="../mn/mn93.html#p21">MN&nbsp;93.21</a>, II 156,<small>30</small> –57,<small>3</small>).</span></span></span> When the descent takes place, there is name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, there are the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, there is contact; with contact as condition, there is feeling. Now it is for one who feels that I proclaim: ‘This is suffering,’ and ‘This is the origin of suffering,’ and ‘This is the cessation of suffering,’ and ‘This is the way leading to the cessation of suffering.’</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of suffering? Birth is suffering, old age is suffering, illness is suffering, death <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.177"></a> is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, dejection, and anguish are suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging are suffering.

At SN <a >12:43</a>, II 72–73, the origination <i>(samudaya)</i> of suffering is explained by way of the links from consciousness through craving; its passing away <i>(atthaṅgama)</i>, by way of the cessation of the links from craving through old age and death. In the Chinese parallel, MĀ 13 (at T I 435a<small>24</small> –436a<small>10</small>), the second and third truths are not explained by way of dependent origination but according to the stock formulations as found in SN <a >56:11</a>, V 421, and elsewhere.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering?
