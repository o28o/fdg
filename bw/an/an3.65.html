<section class="raw_sutta">

<p><span class="parno">1</span>So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kālāmas named Kesamutta. The Kālāmas of Kesamutta heard: </p>

<p>“It seems the ascetic Gotama — a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family — has arrived at Kesamutta. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha …’ It’s good to see such perfected ones.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the Kālāmas went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. Seated to one side the Kālāmas said to the Buddha: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>“There are, sir, some ascetics and brahmins who come to Kesamutta. They explain and promote only their own doctrine, while they attack, badmouth, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others. Then some other ascetics and brahmins come to Kesamutta. They too explain and promote only their own doctrine, while they attack, badmouth, disparage, and smear the doctrines of others. So, sir, we’re doubting and uncertain: ‘I wonder who of these respected ascetics and brahmins speaks the truth, and who speaks falsehood?’”</p>

<p>“It is enough, Kālāmas, for you to be doubting and uncertain. Doubt has come up in you about an uncertain matter.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Please, Kālāmas, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think ‘The ascetic is our respected teacher.’ But when you know for yourselves: ‘These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering’, then you should give them up.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>What do you think, Kālāmas? Does greed come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>“Harm, sir.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>“A greedy individual, overcome by greed, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>“What do you think, Kālāmas? Does hate come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>“Harm, sir.”</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>“A hateful individual, overcome by hate, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>“What do you think, Kālāmas? Does delusion come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>“Harm, sir.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>“A deluded individual, overcome by delusion, kills living creatures, steals, commits adultery, lies, and encourages others to do the same. Is that for their lasting harm and suffering?”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>“What do you think, Kālāmas, are these things skillful or unskillful?”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>“So, Kālāmas, when I said: ‘Please, don’t go by oral transmission, don’t go by lineage, don’t go by testament, don’t go by canonical authority, don’t rely on logic, don’t rely on inference, don’t go by reasoned contemplation, don’t go by the acceptance of a view after consideration, don’t go by the appearance of competence, and don’t think “The ascetic is our respected teacher.” But when you know for yourselves: “These things are unskillful, blameworthy, criticized by sensible people, and when you undertake them, they lead to harm and suffering”, then you should give them up.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>What do you think, Kālāmas? Does contentment come up in a person for their welfare or harm?”</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>“An individual who is content, not overcome by greed, doesn’t kill living creatures, steal, commit adultery, lie, or encourage others to do the same. Is that for their lasting welfare and happiness?”</p>
