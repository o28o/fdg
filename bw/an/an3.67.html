<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>"Bhikkhus, there are these three bases of talk. What three? (1) Referring to the past, one would say: ‘So it was in the past.’ (2) Referring to the future, one would say: ‘So it will be in the future.’ (3) Referring to the present, one would say: ‘So it is now, at present.’</p>

<p id="note464"><span class="parno">2</span>"It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person may be understood as either fit to talk or unfit to talk. If this person is asked a question that should be answered categorically and he does not answer it categorically; <span class="add">if he is asked</span> a question that should be answered after making a distinction and he answers it without making a distinction; <span class="add">if he is asked</span> a question that should be answered with a counter-question and he answers it without asking a counter-question; <span class="add">if he is asked</span> a question that should be set aside and he does not set it aside, in such a case this person is unfit to talk.<span class="note" id="n464"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.464] These are the four methods of formulating questions; see <a href="../an/an4.42.html">AN4.42</a>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "(1) A <i>question that should be answered categorically</i> <i>(ekaṁsavyākaṇanīya pañha)</i> is, for example, ‘Is the eye impermanent?’ which should be answered categorically with ‘Yes, it is impermanent.’ (2) A <i>question that should be answered after making a distinction</i> <i>(vibhajjavyākaraṇīya pañha)</i> is, for example, ‘Is the impermanent the eye?’ which should be answered by making a distinction: ‘Not only the eye, but the ear, nose, etc., are also impermanent.’ (3) A question that should be answered with a counter-question <i>(paṭipucchāvyākaraṇīya pañha)</i> is, for example, ‘Does the eye have the same nature as the ear?’ One should answer this by asking, ‘With respect to what?’ If they reply, ‘With respect to seeing,’ one should answer no. If they reply, ‘With respect to impermanence,’ one should answer yes. (4) A question that should be set aside <i>(ṭhapanīya pañha)</i> is, for example, ‘Is the soul the same as the body?’ This should be set aside without answering it, saying, ‘This has not been declared by the Tathāgata.’" In my opinion, better examples of "a question that should be answered after making a distinction" are the Buddha’s response to Subha at <a href="../mn/mn99.html#p4">MN&nbsp;99.4</a>, II 197,<small>9–18</small>; his response to the brahmin Ujjaya at <a href="../an/an4.39.html">AN4.39</a>, II 42,<small>14–28</small>; and the householder Vajjiyamāhita's response to the wanderers at <a href="../an/an10.94.html">AN10.94</a>, V 190,<small>14–20</small>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person should be understood as either fit to talk or unfit to talk. If this person is asked a question and he does not stand firm in regard to his position and the opposing position; if he does not stand firm in his stratagem; if he does not <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.198"></a> stand firm in an assertion about what is known; if he does not stand firm in the procedure, in such a case this person is unfit to talk.<span class="note" id="n465"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.465] "<i>He does not stand firm in the procedure</i> <i>(paṭipadāya na saṇṭhāti)</i>: Not having understood the rule <i>(vattaṁ ajānitvā)</i>, he asks under circumstances when a question should not be asked. If a question is asked in the courtyard of a memorial shrine <i>(cetiyangana)</i>, one should not answer it. So too, <span class="add">one should not answer</span> on the way to the alms round; when walking for alms in the village; when sitting in the meeting hall; when sitting and taking porridge or a meal; when sitting after the meal; and when going to the place where one passes the day. However, when one is sitting in one's day quarters, if someone asks permission and then poses a question, it should be answered; but one should not answer if they do not ask permission. Such is what is meant by: ‘Asking a question without having understood the rule, he does not stand firm in the procedure.’"</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"It is in relation to talk, bhikkhus, that a person should be understood as either having a supporting condition or not having a supporting condition. One who does not lend an ear does not have a supporting condition; one who lends an ear has a supporting condition. One who has a supporting condition directly knows one thing, fully understands one thing, abandons one thing, and realizes one thing. Directly knowing one thing, fully understanding one thing, abandoning one thing, and realizing one thing, he reaches right liberation.<span class="note" id="n467"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.467] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "He directly knows one thing, a wholesome Dhamma, the noble path. He fully understands one thing, the truth of suffering. He abandons one thing, all unwholesome qualities. He realizes one thing, the fruit of arahantship or <span class="add">the truth of</span> cessation. By means of knowledge he reaches right liberation, emancipation by the fruit of arahantship."</span></span></span></p>

<p>"This, bhikkhus, is the goal of talk, the goal of discussion, the goal of a supporting condition, the goal of lending an ear, that is, the emancipation of the mind through non-clinging." <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.199"></a></p>

<p class="verse" id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Those who speak with quarrelsome intent,
<br>settled in their opinions, swollen with pride,
<br>ignoble, having assailed virtues,<span class="note" id="n468"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.468] <i>Anariyaguṇam āsajja</i>. The line is problematic. As printed, it would be translated: "Having attacked ignoble qualities." But <i>guṇa</i> usually means virtuous qualities. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> gives an unconvincing explanation: "They give a talk using ignoble qualities to attack qualities." I translate on the supposition that the correct reading of the line should be <i>anariyā guṇam āsajja</i>, "the ignoble ones assail (good) qualities." A Chinese parallel, MĀ 119 at T I 609a<small>8</small> –b<small>29</small>, closely matches the Pāli in regard to the verses, and the corresponding line (609b<small>15</small>) accords with my interpretation: <img alt="" src="images/000054.jpg" class="calibre68"/> ("ignoble, they criticize (each others’) virtues").</span></span></span>
<br>look for openings <span class="add">to attack</span> one another.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>They mutually delight when their opponent
<br>speaks badly and makes a mistake,
<br><span class="add">they rejoice</span> in his bewilderment and defeat;
<br>but noble ones don’t engage in such talk.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>If a wise person wants to talk,
<br>having known the time is right,
<br>without quarrelsomeness or pride,
<br>the sagely person should utter
<br>the speech that the noble ones practice,
<br>which is connected with the Dhamma and meaning.<span class="note" id="n469"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.469] <i>Dhammaṭṭhapaṭisaṁyuttā yā ariyācaritā kathā</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> explains <i>dhammaṭṭhapaṭisaṁyuttā</i> thus: "The talk is made by one established in the Dhamma, thus it is established in the Dhamma; and (the talk) is connected with the Dhamma, so it is established in and connected with the Dhamma." Mp thus takes <i>dhammaṭṭha</i> to be a compound of <i>dhamme ṭhita</i>. I translate, however, on the assumption that <i>dhammaṭṭhapaṭisaṁyuttā</i> contains a <i>dvanda</i> compound that should be resolved <i>dhammena ca aṭṭhena ca paṭisaṁyuttā</i>. In explanations of right speech, it is often said that the virtuous person is <i>atthavādī dhammavādī</i>, "one who speaks what is beneficial (or ‘meaningful’), one who speaks on the Dhamma"; see <a href="../an/an3.69.html">AN3.69</a>, I 204,<small>4</small>; <a href="../an/an10.176.html">AN10.176</a> §7, V 267,<small>22</small>. It is unusual—but not exceptional—to find <i>aṭṭha</i> in place of <i>attha</i> with the sense of "meaning" or "benefit"; it would be more unusual to find the termination <i>ṭha</i> embedded inside a compound and followed by a past participle. The Chinese parallel, which I discovered only after I had made my translation, supports my understanding here. At T I 609b<small>19</small> we read: <img alt="" src="images/000062.jpg" class="calibre69"/> "talk that has Dhamma and that has meaning: all the talk of the noble ones is like this." The character <img alt="" src="images/000066.jpg" class="calibre70"/>, like Pāli <i>attha</i>, means both "good" and "meaning," and <img alt="" src="images/000068.jpg" class="calibre71"/> can mean either "beneficial" or "meaningful."</span></span></span></p>

<p class="verse" id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>Not being insolent or aggressive,
<br>with a mind not elated,<span class="note" id="n470"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.470] I read here with Be <i>anunnatena manasā</i>, as against Ce and Ee <i>anupādinnena manasā</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> (both Ce and Be) glosses with <i>anuddhatena cetasā</i>, which supports <i>anunnatena manasā</i>.</span></span></span>
<br>he speaks free from envy
<br>on the basis of right knowledge.
<br>He should approve of what is well expressed
<br>but should not attack what is badly stated.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">12-13</span>He should not train in faultfinding
<br>nor seize on the other's mistakes;
<br>he should not overwhelm and crush his opponent,
<br>nor speak mendacious words.
<br>Truly, a discussion among the good
<br>is for the sake of knowledge and confidence.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Such is the way the noble discuss things;
<br>this is the discussion of the noble ones.
<br>Having understood this, the wise person
<br>should not swell up but should discuss things.</p>
