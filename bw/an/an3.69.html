When a greedy person, overcome by greed, with mind obsessed by it, inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretext<span class="note" id="n472"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.472] <i>Asatā dukkhaṁ upadahati.</i> <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> Ce: "He creates suffering by falsehood, by what is non-existent, having spoken about an unreal fault" <i>(abhūtena avijjamānena yaṁ kiñci tassa abhūtaṁ dosaṁ vatvā dukkhaṁ uppādeti)</i>. Note that Mp takes <i>asatā</i> to be synonymous with <i>abhūtena</i>. In both text and <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp,</a> Be reads <i>uppādayati</i> whereas Ce and Ee have <i>upadahati</i>.</span></span></span>—by killing, imprisonment, confiscation, censure, or banishment—(thinking): ‘I am powerful, I want power,’ that too is unwholesome. Thus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of greed, caused by greed, arisen from greed, conditioned by greed.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>(2) "Whatever hatred occurs is unwholesome. Whatever (deed) a person full of hate performs by body, speech, and mind is also unwholesome. When a person full of hate, overcome by hatred, with mind obsessed by it, inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretext … (thinking): ‘I am powerful, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.202"></a> I want power,’ that too is unwholesome. Thus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of hatred, caused by hatred, arisen from hatred, conditioned by hatred.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>(3) "Whatever delusion occurs is unwholesome. Whatever (deed) a deluded person performs by body, speech, and mind is also unwholesome. When a deluded person, overcome by delusion, with mind obsessed by it, inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretext … (thinking): ‘I am powerful, I want power,’ that too is unwholesome. Thus numerous bad unwholesome qualities originate in him born of delusion, caused by delusion, arisen from delusion, conditioned by delusion."Such a person, bhikkhus, is called one who speaks at an improper time, who speaks falsely, who speaks what is unbeneficial, who speaks non-Dhamma, who speaks non-discipline. </p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>And why is such a person called one who speaks at an improper time … who speaks non-discipline?</p>

<p>This person inflicts suffering upon another under a false pretext—by killing, imprisonment, confiscation, censure, or banishment—thinking: ‘I am powerful, I want power.’ Thus when spoken to in accordance with fact, he despises (the one who reproaches him); he does not admit (his faults). When spoken to contrary to fact, he does not make an effort to unravel what is said to him: ‘For such and such a reason this is untrue; for such and such a reason this is contrary to fact.’ Therefore such a person is called one who speaks at an improper time, who speaks falsely, who speaks what is unbeneficial, who speaks non-Dhamma, who speaks non-discipline.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6-7</span>"Such a person, overcome by bad unwholesome qualities born of greed … born of hatred … born of delusion, with his mind obsessed by them, dwells in suffering in this very life, with distress, anguish, and fever, and with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination can be expected for him.</p>

<p>"Suppose a tree<span class="note" id="n473"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.473] Here and below the text mentions three kinds of trees: the <i>sāla</i>, the <i>dhava</i>, and the <i>phandana</i>.</span></span></span> was choked and enveloped by three <i>māluvā</i> creepers. It would meet with calamity, with disaster, with calamity and disaster. So too, such a person overcome by bad unwholesome qualities born of greed <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.203"></a> … </p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>… born of hatred … born of delusion, with his mind obsessed by them, dwells in suffering in this very life, with distress, anguish, and fever, and with the breakup of the body, after death, a bad destination can be expected for him. These are the three unwholesome roots.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"There are, bhikkhus, these three wholesome roots. What three? The wholesome root, non-greed; the wholesome root, non-hatred; and the wholesome root, non-delusion.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>(1) "Whatever non-greed occurs, bhikkhus, is wholesome. Whatever (deed) one without greed performs by body, speech, and mind is also wholesome. When one without greed, not overcome by greed, with mind not obsessed by it, does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretext—by killing, imprisonment, confiscation, censure, or banishment—thinking: ‘I am powerful, I want power,’ that too is wholesome. Thus numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of non-greed, caused by non-greed, arisen from non-greed, conditioned by non-greed.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>(2) "Whatever non-hatred occurs is wholesome. Whatever (deed) one without hate performs by body, speech, and mind is also wholesome. When one without hate, not overcome by hatred, with mind not obsessed by it, does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretext … that too is wholesome. Thus numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of non-hatred, caused by non-hatred, arisen from non-hatred, conditioned by non-hatred.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>(3) "Whatever non-delusion occurs is wholesome. Whatever (deed) one who is undeluded performs by body, speech, and mind is also wholesome. When one who is undeluded, not overcome by delusion, with mind not obsessed by it, does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretext … that too is wholesome. Thus <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.204"></a> numerous wholesome qualities originate in him born of non-delusion, caused by non-delusion, arisen from non-delusion, conditioned by non-delusion.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"Such a person, bhikkhus, is called one who speaks at the proper time, who speaks in accordance with fact, who speaks what is beneficial, who speaks Dhamma, who speaks discipline. And why is such a person called one who speaks at the proper time … who speaks discipline? This person does not inflict suffering upon another under a false pretext—by killing, imprisonment, confiscation, censure, or banishment—thinking: ‘I am powerful, I want power.’ Thus when spoken to in accordance with fact, he admits (his faults); he does not despise (the one who reproaches him). When spoken to contrary to fact, he makes an effort to unravel what is said to him: ‘For such and such a reason this is untrue; for such and such a reason this is contrary to fact.’ Therefore such a person is called one who speaks at the proper time, who speaks in accordance with fact, who speaks what is beneficial, who speaks Dhamma, who speaks discipline.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p14-15"><span class="parno">14-15</span>"Such a person has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities born of greed … born of hatred … born of delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. He dwells happily in this very life, without distress, anguish, or fever, and in this very life he attains nibbāna.</p>

<p>" Suppose a tree was choked and enveloped by three <i>māluvā</i> creepers. Then a man would come along bringing a shovel and a basket. He would cut down the creepers at their roots, dig them up, and pull out the roots, even the fine rootlets and root-fiber. He would cut the creepers into pieces, split the pieces, and reduce them to slivers. Then he would dry the slivers in the wind and sun, burn them in a fire, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.205"></a> reduce them to ashes, and winnow the ashes in a strong wind or let them be carried away by the swift current of a river. In this way, those <i>māluvā</i> creepers would be cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated so that they are no more subject to future arising.</p>

<hr>
<p>"So too, bhikkhus, such a person has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities born of greed … </p>

<hr>
<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>… born of hatred … born of delusion, cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising.
