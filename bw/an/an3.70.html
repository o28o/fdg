<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park. Then Visākhā Migāramātā, on the day of the uposatha, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to her.</p>

<p>"Why, Visākhā, have you come in the middle of the day?.</p>

<p>"Today, Bhante, I am observing the uposatha."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"There are, Visākhā, three kinds of uposathas. What three? The cowherds’ uposatha, the Nigaṇṭhas’ uposatha,<span class="note" id="n474"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.474] The Nigaṇṭhas are the Jain ascetics, followers of Mahāvīra, the best known teacher of Jainism, known in the Nikāyas as the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta (Nāthaputta, Ñātaputta). He was a contemporary of the Buddha and is included among the six rival teachers (see <a href="../dn/dn2.html#p30">DN&nbsp;2.30</a>, I 52–59). It will be noted how, whenever the Nikāyas discuss the Jains, their tone becomes derisive if not acerbic. The compliments, of course, were returned by the Jains. This can be readily understood from the fact that the Buddhists and Jains originally flourished in the same territories and, as mendicant orders, they must have been in competition for supporters from the same communities.</span></span></span> and the noble ones’ uposatha.</p>

<p>(1) "And how, Visākhā, is the cowherds’ uposatha observed? Suppose, Visākhā, in the evening a cowherd returns the cows to their owners. He reflects thus: ‘Today the cows grazed in such and such a place and drank water in such and such a place. Tomorrow the cows will graze in such and such a place and drink water in such and such a place.’ So too, someone here observing the uposatha reflects thus: ‘Today I ate this and that food; today I ate a meal of this and that kind. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.206"></a> Tomorrow I will eat this and that food; tomorrow I will eat a meal of this and that kind.’ He thereby passes the day with greed and longing in his mind. It is in such a way that the cowherds’ uposatha is observed. The cowherds’ uposatha, thus observed, is not of great fruit and benefit, nor is it extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>(2) "And how, Visākhā, is the Nigaṇṭhas’ uposatha observed? There are, Visākhā, ascetics called Nigaṇṭhas. They enjoin their disciples thus: ‘Come, good man, lay down the rod toward living beings dwelling more than a hundred <i>yojanas</i>’ distance in the eastern quarter.<span class="note" id="n475"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.475] <i>Ye puratthimāya disāya pāṇā paraṁ yojanasataṁ tesu daṇḍaṁ nikkhipāhi.</i> <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses: "Lay down the rod and be nonviolent toward those living beings dwelling in regions farther than a hundred <i>yojanas</i>" <i>(tesu yojanasatato parabhāgesu ṭhitesu sattesu daṇḍaṁ nikkhipa</i>, <i>nikkhittadaṇḍo hohi)</i>. A <i>yojana</i> is between seven and nine miles. Thus the Jains are depicted as saying, "It's only toward beings living far away from you that you should be nonviolent," as if they were permitted to be violent against those living close by. This, it seems, is contrary to the Jain teaching, which enjoins strict nonviolence <i>(ahiṁsā)</i> in regard to all beings under all conditions. See <a href="http://www.jainworld.com/philosophy/ahimsa.asp">http://www.jainworld.com/philosophy/ahimsa.asp</a>.</span></span></span> Lay down the rod toward living beings dwelling more than a hundred <i>yojanas</i>’ distance in the western quarter. Lay down the rod toward living beings dwelling more than a hundred <i>yojanas</i>’ distance in the northern quarter. Lay down the rod toward living beings dwelling more than a hundred <i>yojanas</i>’ distance in the southern quarter.’ Thus they enjoin them to be sympathetic and compassionate toward some living beings, but not to others. On the uposatha day, they enjoin their disciples thus: ‘Come, good man, having laid aside all clothes, recite: ‘I am not anywhere the belonging of anyone, nor is there anywhere anything in any place that is mine.’<span class="note" id="n476"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.476] <i>Nāhaṁ kvacana</i>, <i>kassaci kiñcanatasmiṁ</i>, <i>na ca mama kvacana</i>, <i>katthaci kiñcanatātthi</i>. Ce, Be, and Ee differ slightly among themselves in their reading of this formula. I follow Ce here and later at <a href="../an/an4.185.html">AN4.185</a>. The purpose of the formula, according to this text, is to instill an attitude of non-possessiveness, one of the basic Jain virtues. The Buddha also taught this formula—which may have been in circulation among various contemplative communities—using it as a means to eliminate "I-making" and "mine-making." For further discussion of the formula, see <a href="an4.185.html#n896">AN4.185, n.&nbsp;896</a>.</span></span></span> However, his parents know: ‘This is our son.’ And he knows: ‘These are my parents.’ His wife and children know: ‘He is our supporter.’ And he knows: ‘These are my wife and children.’ His slaves, workers, and servants know: ‘He is our master.’ And he knows: ‘These are my slaves, workers, and servants.’ Thus on an occasion when they should be enjoined in truthfulness, (the Nigaṇṭhas) enjoin them in false speech. This, I say, is false speech. When that night has passed, he makes use of possessions that have not been given. This, I say, is taking what has not been given. It is in such a way that the Nigaṇṭhas’ uposatha is observed. When one has observed the uposatha in the way of the Nigaṇṭhas, the uposatha is not of great fruit and benefit, nor is it extraordinarily brilliant and pervasive.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>(3) "And how, Visākhā, is the noble ones’ uposatha observed? <a class="pts_pn" id="an.i.207"></a> The defiled mind is cleansed by exertion.<span class="note" id="n477"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.477] <i>Upakkiliṭṭhassa visākhe cittassa upakkamena pariyodapanā hoti</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "Why does he say this? Because the uposatha is not very fruitful if one observes it with a defiled mind, but becomes very fruitful if it is observed with a purified mind. He thus makes this statement to introduce the meditation subjects to be used for purifying the mind." What follows here are five of the standard six recollections <i>(cha anussati</i>yo; see <a href="../an/an6.10.html">AN6.10</a>, etc.). For some reason, the sixth recollection, of generosity <i>(cāgānussati)</i>, is omitted. The omission would seem, at first blush, to result from a fault in transmission. However, the Chinese parallel, MĀ 202 (at T I 770a<small>16</small> –773a<small>1</small>), also lacks this recollection, which suggests that the omission—whether accidental or deliberate—preceded the split between the Vibhajjavādins (the ancestors of the Theravāda) and the Sarvāstivādins. Interestingly, in MĀ 202 the eight precepts <i>precede</i> the five recollections, while the Pāli has the sets in reverse. The sequence of the Chinese version is more consistent with other Buddhist teachings, which treat virtuous conduct as the basis for meditation.</span></span></span> And how is the defiled mind cleansed by exertion? Here, Visākhā, a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata thus: ‘The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, his mind becomes placid, joy arises, and the defilements of the mind are abandoned in the same way that one's head, when dirty, is cleansed by exertion.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"And how, Visākhā, does one cleanse a dirty head by exertion? By means of cleansing paste, clay, water, and the appropriate effort by the person.

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"And how, Visākhā, does one cleanse a dirty body by exertion? By means of a bathing brush, lime powder, water, and the appropriate effort by the person.
