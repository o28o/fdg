<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Bhoganagara near the Ānanda Shrine. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus!"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, I will teach you these four great references.<span class="note" id="n892"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.892] <i>Mahāpadese</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses as <i>mahā-okāse</i> (apparently as if the compound could be resolved <i>mahā</i> + <i>padese)</i> and as <i>mahā-apadese</i>, the latter explained as "great reasons stated with reference to such great ones as the Buddha and others" <i>(buddhādayo mahante mahante apadisitvā vuttāni mahākāraṇāni)</i>. This second resolution is certainly to be preferred. DOP gives, among the meanings of <i>apadesa</i>, "designation, pointing out, reference, witness, authority." <i>Cattāro mahāpadesā</i> is sometimes rendered "four great authorities" but the sutta actually specifies only two authorities, the suttas and the Vinaya. Walshe, in LDB, renders it as "four criteria." I understand the term to mean "four great references," the four provenances of a teaching.</span></span></span> <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.168"></a> Listen and attend closely; I will speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p>(1) "Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu might say: ‘In the presence of the Blessed One I heard this; in his presence I learned this: "This is the Dhamma; this is the discipline; this is the Teacher's teaching!"’ That bhikkhu's statement should neither be approved nor rejected. Without approving or rejecting it, you should thoroughly learn those words and phrases and then check for them in the discourses and seek them in the discipline.<span class="note" id="n893"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.893] <i>Tāni padabyañjanāni</i> … <i>sutte otāretabbāni vinaye sandassetabbāni</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> gives various meanings of <i>sutte</i> and <i>vinaye</i> here, some improbable. Clearly, this instruction presupposes that there already existed a body of discourses and a systematic Vinaya that could be used to evaluate other texts proposed for inclusion as authentic utterances of the Buddha. <i>Otāretabbāni</i> is gerundive plural of <i>otārenti</i>, "make descend, put down or put into," and <i>otaranti</i>, just below, means "descend, come down, go into." My renderings, respectively, as "check for them" and "are included among" are adapted to the context. <i>Sandassetabbāni</i> is gerundive plural of <i>sandassenti</i>, "show, make seen," and <i>sandissanti</i> means "are seen."</span></span></span> If, when you check for them in the discourses and seek them in the discipline, (you find that) they are not included among the discourses and are not to be seen in the discipline, you should draw the conclusion: ‘Surely, this is not the word of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. It has been badly learned by this bhikkhu.’ Thus you should discard it.</p>

<p>"These, bhikkhus, are the four great references."<span class="note" id="n894"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.894] The clearer of the two Chinese parallels is in <a href="an0-abbr.html">DĀ</a> 2, at T I 17b<small>29</small> –18a<small>22</small>. Here <i>cattāro mahāpadesā</i> is rendered <img alt="" src="images/000089.jpg" class="calibre92"/>, "four great teaching <i>dhammas</i>." I translate the first declaration (T I 17c<small>2–13</small>) as follows: "If there is a bhikkhu who claims: ‘Venerable ones, in that village, city, country, I personally heard (this) from the Buddha, I personally received this teaching,’ you should not disbelieve what you hear from him, nor should you reject it, but through the suttas determine whether it is true or false; based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, probe it thoroughly. If what he says is not the sutta, not the Vinaya, not the Dhamma, then you should say to him: ‘The Buddha did not say this. What you have received is mistaken! (Or: You have received it erroneously!) For what reason? Because based on the suttas, based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, we (find) that what you said deviates from the Dhamma. Venerable one, you should not uphold this, you should not report it to people, but should discard it.’ But if what he says is based on the suttas, based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, then you should say to him: ‘What you said was truly spoken by the Buddha. For what reason? Because based on the suttas, based on the Vinaya, based on the Dhamma, we (find) that what you said accords with the Dhamma. Venerable one, you should uphold this, you should widely report it to people; you should not discard it.’ This is the first great teaching <i>dhamma</i>."</span></span></span></p>
