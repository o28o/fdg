<hr>
<p>(1) "By dwelling together their virtuous behavior can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.</p>

<p>(2) "By dealing <span class="add">with them</span> their integrity can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.</p>

<p>(3) "In misfortune their fortitude can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.</p>

<p>(4) "By conversation their wisdom can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>(1) "It was said: ‘By dwelling together their virtuous behavior can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.’ On account of what was this said?</p>

<p>"Here, bhikkhus, by dwelling together with another person, one comes to know him thus: ‘For a long time this venerable one's conduct has been broken, flawed, blemished, and blotched, and he does not consistently observe and follow virtuous behavior. This venerable one is immoral, not virtuous.’</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"But in another case, by dwelling together with another person, one comes to know him thus: ‘For a long time this venerable one's conduct has been unbroken, flawless, unblemished, and unblotched, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.188"></a> and he consistently observes and follows virtuous behavior. This venerable one is virtuous, not immoral.’</p>

<p>"It was on account of this that it was said: ‘By dwelling together their virtuous behavior can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.’</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>(2) "Further it was said: ‘By dealing <span class="add">with them</span> their integrity can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.’ On account of what was this said?</p>

<p>"Here, bhikkhus, when dealing with a person, one comes to know him thus: ‘This venerable one deals with one person in one way, in another way if he deals with two, in still another way if he deals with three, and in still another way if he deals with many. His dealings in one case deviate from his dealings in another.<span class="note" id="n905"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.905] Here and just below, I read with <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> and Be <i>purimavohārā pacchimavohāraṁ</i>.</span></span></span> This venerable one is impure in his dealings with others, not pure in such dealings.’</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"But in another case, when dealing with a person, one comes to know him thus: ‘In the same way as he deals with one, he deals with two, three, or many. His dealings in one case do not deviate from his dealings in another. This venerable one is pure in his dealings with others, not impure in such dealings.’</p>

<p>"It was on account of this that it was said: ‘By dealing <span class="add">with them</span> their integrity can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.’</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>(3) "Further it was said: ‘In misfortune their fortitude can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.’ On account of what was this said?</p>

<p>"Here, bhikkhus, someone is afflicted with the loss of relatives, wealth, or health, but he does not reflect thus: ‘Human life in the world is of such a nature<span class="note" id="n906"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.906] I render this freely to conform to ordinary English diction. The Pāli <i>tathābhūto kho ayaṁ lokasannivāso tathābhūto ayaṁ attabhāvapaṭilābho</i> literally means: "This dwelling in the world is of such a nature, this obtaining of individual existence is of such a nature …." <i>Lokasannivāso</i> is also in <a href="../an/an3.40.html">AN3.40</a> §2.</span></span></span> that the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions, namely, gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.’ Thus when afflicted with loss of relatives, wealth, or health, he sorrows, languishes, and laments; he weeps beating his breast and becomes confused.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"But in another case, someone is afflicted with the loss of relatives, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.189"></a> wealth, or health, but he does reflect thus: ‘Human life in the world is such that the eight worldly conditions revolve around the world, and the world revolves around these eight worldly conditions, namely, gain and loss, disrepute and fame, blame and praise, and pleasure and pain.’ Thus when afflicted with the loss of relatives, wealth, or health, he does not sorrow, languish, and lament; he does not weep beating his breast and become confused.</p>

<p>"It was on account of this that it was said: ‘In misfortune their fortitude can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.’</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>(4) "Further it was said: ‘By conversation their wisdom can be known, and this only after a long time, not casually; by one who is attentive, not by one who is inattentive; and by one who is wise, not by one who is unwise.’ On account of what was this said?</p>

<p>"Here, bhikkhus, when conversing with someone, one comes to know: ‘Judging from the way this venerable one initiates, formulates, and poses a question, he is unwise, not wise. For what reason? This venerable one does not speak about matters that are deep, peaceful, sublime, beyond the sphere of reasoning, subtle, comprehensible to the wise. When this venerable one speaks on the Dhamma, he is not able to explain, teach, describe, establish, reveal, analyze, and explicate its meaning either briefly or in detail. This venerable one is unwise, not wise.’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Just as if a man with good sight, standing on the bank of a pond, were to see a small fish emerging, he would think: ‘Judging from the way this fish emerges, from the ripples it makes, and from its force, this is a small fish, not a big one,’ so too, when conversing with a person, one comes to know: ‘Judging from the way this venerable one initiates, formulates, and poses a question, he is unwise, not wise.’</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"But in another case, when conversing with someone, one comes to know: ‘Judging from the way this venerable one initiates, formulates, and poses a question, he is wise, not unwise.
