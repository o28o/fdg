<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then Bhaddiya the Licchavi approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Bhante, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a magician who knows a converting magic by which he converts the disciples of teachers of other sects.’ Do those who speak thus state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact? Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma so that they do not incur any reasonable criticism or ground for censure? For we do not want to misrepresent the Blessed One."<span class="note" id="n907"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.907] This charge is also at SN <a >42:13</a>, IV 340,<small>23–29</small>. According to <a href="../mn/mn56.html#p33">MN&nbsp;56.33</a>, I 375,<small>24–26</small>, it originated among the Jains.</span></span></span> <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.191"></a></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Come, Bhaddiya, do not go by oral tradition, by lineage of teaching, by hearsay, by a collection of scriptures, by logical reasoning, by inferential reasoning, by reasoned cogitation, by the acceptance of a view after pondering it, by the seeming competence <span class="add">of a speaker</span>, or because you think: ‘The ascetic is our guru.’ But when you know for yourself: ‘These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to harm and suffering,’ then you should abandon them.<span class="note" id="n908"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.908] This is the Buddha’s advice to the Kālāmas at <a href="../an/an3.65.html">AN3.65</a>.

<p>"Bhaddiya, a greedy person, overcome by greed, with mind obsessed by it, destroys life, takes what is not given, transgresses with another's wife, and speaks falsehood; and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>(2) "What do you think, Bhaddiya?

Since the sutta speaks about <i>sārambha</i> as occurring through body, speech, and mind, I settle for "vehemence."</span></span></span></p>

<p>"For his harm, Bhante."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Bhaddiya, a vehement person, overcome and with mind obsessed by vehemence, destroys life … and he encourages others to do likewise. Will that lead to his harm and suffering for a long time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"What do you think, Bhaddiya? Are these things wholesome or unwholesome?" – "Unwholesome, Bhante." – "Blameworthy or blameless?" – "Blameworthy, Bhante." – "Censured or praised by the wise?" – "Censured by the wise, Bhante." – "Accepted and undertaken, do they lead to harm and suffering or not, or how do you take it?" – "Accepted and undertaken, these things lead to harm and suffering. So we take it."</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Thus, Bhaddiya, when we said: ‘Come, Bhaddiya, do not go by oral tradition … <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.192"></a> … But when you know for yourself: "These things are unwholesome; these things are blameworthy; these things are censured by the wise; these things, if undertaken and practiced, lead to harm and suffering," then you should abandon them,’ it is because of this that this was said.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>(1) "What do you think, Bhaddiya? When non-greed arises in a person, is it for his welfare or for his harm?"</p>

<p>"Bhaddiya, a person without greed, not overcome by greed, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life, take what is not given, transgress with another's wife, or speak falsehood; nor does he encourage others to do likewise.

<p>"Bhaddiya, a non-vehement person, not overcome by vehemence, his mind not obsessed by it, does not destroy life … nor does he encourage others to do likewise. Will that lead to his welfare and happiness for a long time?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"What do you think, Bhaddiya?

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Thus, Bhaddiya, when we said: ‘Come, Bhaddiya, do not go by oral tradition … But when you know for yourself: "These things are wholesome; these things are blameless; these things are praised by the wise; these things, if accepted and undertaken, lead to welfare and happiness," then you should live in accordance with them,’ it is because of this that this was said.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"Bhaddiya, the good persons in the world encourage their disciples thus: ‘Come, good man, you should constantly remove greed.<span class="note" id="n910"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.910] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> reads <i>lobhaṁ vineyya vineyya viharanto</i>, and so in relation to <i>dosa, moha</i>, and <i>sārambha</i>. I try to capture this sense with "constantly," though "repeatedly" might also have been used. Be and Ee read simply <i>lobhaṁ vineyya viharanto</i>.</span></span></span> When you constantly remove greed, you will not do any action born of greed, whether by body, speech, or mind. You should constantly remove hatred. When you constantly remove hatred, you will not do any action born of hatred, whether by body, speech, or mind. You should constantly remove delusion. When you constantly remove delusion, you will not do any action born of delusion, whether by body, speech, or mind. You should constantly remove vehemence. When you constantly remove vehemence, you will not do any action born of vehemence, whether by body, speech, or mind.’"</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>When this was said, Bhaddiya the Licchavi said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Bhante! … Let the Blessed One consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"Now, Bhaddiya, did I say to you: ‘Come, Bhaddiya, be my disciple and I will be your teacher?’"</p>

<p>"Surely not, Bhante."</p>

<hr>
<p>"But, Bhaddiya, though I speak thus and declare <span class="add">my teaching</span> in such a way, some ascetics and brahmins untruthfully, baselessly, falsely, and wrongly misrepresent me when they say: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a magician who knows a converting magic by which he converts the disciples of teachers of other sects.’" <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.194"></a></p>

<p>"Excellent is that converting magic, Bhante! Good is that converting magic! If my beloved relatives and family members would be converted by this conversion, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all khattiyas would be converted by this conversion, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all brahmins … vessas … suddas would be converted by this conversion, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time."<span class="note" id="n911"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.911] See <a href="../mn/mn56.html#p74">MN&nbsp;56.74</a>, II 383,<small>32</small> –384,<small>7</small>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"So it is, Bhaddiya, so it is! If all khattiyas would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If all brahmins … vessas … suddas would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time. If the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long time. If these great sal trees would be converted by this conversion toward the abandoning of unwholesome qualities and the acquisition of wholesome qualities, that would lead to the welfare and happiness even of these great sal trees for a long time, if they could choose.<span class="note" id="n912"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.912] The words <i>sace ceteyyuṁ</i> are in <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> and Ee, but not Be.</span></span></span> How much more then for a human being!"</p>
