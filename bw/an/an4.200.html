<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>(1) "And how, bhikkhus, is affection born from affection? Here, one person is desirable, lovable, and agreeable to another. Others treat that person in a way that is desirable, lovable, and agreeable. It occurs to the latter: ‘Others treat that person who is desirable, lovable, and agreeable to me in a way that is desirable, lovable, and agreeable.’ He thus feels affection for them. It is in this way that affection is born from affection.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>(2) "And how is hatred born from affection? Here, one person is desirable, lovable, and agreeable to another. Others treat that person in a way that is undesirable, unlovable, and disagreeable. It occurs to the latter: ‘Others treat that person who is desirable, lovable, and agreeable to me in a way that is undesirable, unlovable, and disagreeable.’ He thus feels hatred for them. It is in this way that hatred is born from affection.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"When, secluded from sensual pleasures … a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, on that occasion affection born from affection does not exist in him, hatred born from affection does not exist in him, affection born from hatred does not exist in him, and hatred born from hatred does not exist in him.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"When, with the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna … the third jhāna … the fourth jhāna, on that occasion affection born from affection does not exist in him, hatred born from affection does not exist in him, affection born from hatred does not exist in him, and hatred born from hatred does not exist in him.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"When, with the destruction of the taints, a bhikkhu has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it, then he has abandoned affection born from affection, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; he has abandoned hatred born from affection, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; he has abandoned affection born from hatred, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising; and he has abandoned hatred born from hatred, cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising.</p>

<p>"This is called a bhikkhu who neither picks up nor pushes away, who does not fume, does not blaze, and does not ruminate.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"And how does a bhikkhu pick up?<span class="note" id="n937"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.937] <a href="an0-abbr.html">DOP</a> defines the verb <i>usseneti</i> as "forms an association (with), is involved," but <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses it with <i>ukkhipati</i>, which DOP says can mean "throws up; raises; lifts up, picks up, holds up; raises up, extols." What follows are the twenty modes of personal-existence view <i>(sakkāyadiṭṭhi)</i>, the view of a real self existing in relation to the five aggregates. There are four modes in relation to each of the five aggregates.</span></span></span> Here, a bhikkhu regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form. He regards feeling as self … <a class="pts_pn" id="an.ii.215"></a> … perception as self … volitional activities as self … consciousness as self, or self as possessing consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. It is in this way that a bhikkhu picks up.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"And how does a bhikkhu push away? Here, a bhikkhu insults one who insults him, scolds one who scolds him, and argues with one who picks an argument with him. It is in this way that a bhikkhu pushes away.</p>
