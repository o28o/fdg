<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n1102"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1102] The opening story, together with the discourse on the five kinds of teachers, is at Vin II 185–87.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambī in Ghosita's Park. Now on that occasion Kakudha the Koliyan son, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna's attendant, had recently died and been reborn among a certain group of mind-made <span class="add">deities</span>.<span class="note" id="n1103"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1103] <i>Manomayaṁ kāyaṁ upapanno</i>. The mind-made deities are those reborn in the form realm through the power of their past attainment of the jhānas.</span></span></span> His body was two or three times the size of the fields of a Magadhan village, but he did not obstruct either himself or others with that body.<span class="note" id="n1104"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1104] On the size of his body, the text reads <i>dve vā tīṇi vā māgadhikāni gāmakkhettāni</i>. On <i>gāmakkhetta</i> Brahmāli writes: "This word also occurs at MN&nbsp;III 10,<small>11</small>: <i>ekaṁ gāmakkhettaṁ upanissāya viharāma</i>, and at MN&nbsp;II 167,<small>27</small>: <i>amhākaṁ gāmakkhettaṁ āgacchanti</i>. From these passages it seems quite clear to me that <i>gāmakkhetta</i> refers to a village <i>together with all</i> its fields" (private communication). The figures for length given by <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> suggest that his body was 3–4.5 miles or 5–7 km tall.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the young deva Kakudha approached the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.123"></a> said to him: "Bhante, such a desire arose in Devadatta: ‘I will take charge of the Saṅgha of bhikkhus.’ And together with the arising of this thought, Devadatta lost that psychic potency."<span class="note" id="n1105"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1105] The text says <i>tassā iddhiyā</i>, "that psychic potency," not <i>tassa iddhiyā</i>, "his psychic potency." The pronoun refers to a psychic power already mentioned, yet the sutta does not make clear what it is. The context is provided by Vin II 184,<small>33</small> –185,<small>21</small>, where Devadatta exercises the psychic power of transforming himself into a young boy wearing a girdle of snakes. He used this power to impress Prince Ajātasattu and win his support. Thereupon Devadatta thought to wrest control of the Saṅgha from the Buddha, whereupon he lost <i>that</i> psychic potency.</span></span></span> This is what the young deva Kakudha said. He then paid homage to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">3-4</span>Then the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported all that had happened. <span class="add">The Blessed One said:</span></p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"But, Moggallāna, have you encompassed his mind with your mind and understood of the young deva Kakudha: ‘Whatever the young deva Kakudha says is all true and not otherwise’?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante."</p>

<p>"Take note of this statement, Moggallāna! Now that foolish man will, of his own accord, expose himself.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"There are, Moggallāna, these five kinds of teachers found in the world. What five? <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.124"></a></p>

<p>(1) "Here, some teacher whose behavior is unpurified claims: ‘I am one whose behavior is purified. My behavior is purified, cleansed, undefiled.’ His disciples know him thus: ‘This honorable teacher, though of unpurified behavior, claims: "I am one whose behavior is purified. My behavior is purified, cleansed, undefiled." Now he would not like it if we were to report this to the laypeople. How can we treat him in a way that he would not like? Further, he is honored with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick. A person will be known by what he himself does.’<span class="note" id="n1106"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1106] <i>Yaṁ tumo karissati tumo’va tena paññāyissati</i>. PED explains the stem <i>tuma</i> as "most likely apostrophe form of <i>ātuma</i> = <i>attā</i>, Skt <i>ātman</i> self." <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> paraphrases: "One will be known by the action that one does" <i>(yaṁ esa karissati, eso’va tena kammena pākaṭo bhavissati)</i>.</span></span></span> His disciples cover up such a teacher with respect to his behavior, and such a teacher expects to be covered up by his disciples with respect to his behavior.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>(2) "Again, some teacher whose livelihood is unpurified claims: ‘I am one whose livelihood is purified.

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>(5) "Again, some teacher whose knowledge and vision are unpurified claims: ‘I am one whose knowledge and vision are purified.
