<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Then the brahmin Doṇa approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When he had concluded his greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"I have heard, Master Gotama: ‘The ascetic Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat.’<span class="note" id="n1183"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1183] This seems to have been a common criticism of the Buddha. See too <a href="../an/an4.22.html">AN4.22</a> and <a href="../an/an8.11.html">AN8.11</a>.</span></span></span> This is indeed true, for Master Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is not proper, Master Gotama."</p>

<p>"Do you too claim to be a brahmin, Doṇa?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Master Gotama, if one could rightly say of anyone: ‘He is a brahmin well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation; he is a reciter and preserver of the hymns, a master of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he is fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a great man’—it is precisely of me that one might say this. For I, Master Gotama, am a brahmin well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth as far back as the seventh paternal generation. I am a reciter and preserver of the hymns, a master of the three Vedas with their vocabularies, ritual, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, I am fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a great man."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Doṇa, the ancient <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.224"></a> seers among the brahmin—that is, Aṭṭhaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Angīrasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāseṭṭha, Kassapa, and Bhagu—were the creators of the hymns and the composers of the hymns, and it is their ancient hymns, formerly chanted, declared, and compiled, that the brahmins nowadays still chant and repeat, repeating what was spoken, reciting what was recited, and teaching what was taught. Those ancient seers described these five kinds of brahmins: the one similar to Brahmā, the one similar to a deva, the one who remains within the boundary, the one who has crossed the boundary, and the caṇḍāḷa of a brahmin as the fifth. Which of these are you, Doṇa?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"We do not know these five kinds of brahmins, Master Gotama. All we know is <span class="add">the word</span> ‘brahmins.’ Please, let Master Gotama teach me the Dhamma in such a way that I might know these five kinds of brahmins."</p>

<p>"Then listen, brahmin, and attend closely. I will speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir," the brahmin Doṇa replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

While marriage later became the norm for brahmins during the prime of life, it seems that in this period some brahmins, after completing their training, chose to renounce secular life even in their youth and maintained their renunciant status throughout their lives. On celibate brahmin ascetics, see Samuel 2008:122–23, 154–65.</span></span></span> When he has gone forth, he dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will. He dwells pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion … with a mind imbued with altruistic joy … with a mind imbued with equanimity, likewise the second quarter, the third quarter, and the fourth quarter. Thus above, below, across, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he dwells pervading the entire world with a mind imbued with equanimity, vast, exalted, measureless, without enmity, without ill will.

This is one of the few places in the Nikāyas where the word <i>brahmavihāra</i> is used to designate these four meditations collectively. Wherever the word is used in the Nikāyas, it immediately precedes the practitioner's rebirth in the brahmā world.</span></span></span> with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in the brahmā world. In this way a brahmin is similar to Brahmā.</p>

He does not couple with a pregnant woman, nor with a woman who is nursing, nor with a woman out of season.</p>

<p>"And why, Doṇa, doesn’t the brahmin couple with a pregnant woman? Because, if he were to couple with a pregnant woman, the little boy or girl would be born in excessive filth; therefore he does not couple with a pregnant woman.</p>

<hr>
<p>And why doesn’t he couple with a woman who is nursing?

This reading, it seems, joins the premise of the hypothetical to the consequence of the alternative (that is, when the brahmin has relations with his wife only when she is in season). I follow Brahmāli's suggestion to delete <i>sace doṇa brāhmaṇo anutuniṁ gacchati</i>, which leaves a text that makes good sense. Be does not have the question about why the brahmin couples with a woman only when she is in season, but follows the statement that he does not couple with a nursing woman with the words: <i>tassa sā hoti brāhmaṇī n’eva kāmatthā na davatthā na ratatthā, pajatthāva brāhmaṇassa brāhmaṇī hoti</i>. It seems that, in this reading, a clause has been lost.</span></span></span> When he has engaged in sexual activity, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on ochre robes, and goes forth from the household life into homelessness.</p>

Having developed these four jhānas, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.227"></a> with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world. In this way a brahmin is similar to a deva.</p>
