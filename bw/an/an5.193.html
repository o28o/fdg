In relation to the hindrance of sensual desire, escape by suppression <i>(vikkhambhananissaraṇa)</i> occurs through the first jhāna based on the unattractive nature of the body, escape in a particular respect <i>(tadaṅganissaraṇa)</i> through insight, and escape by eradication <i>(samucchedanissaraṇa)</i> through the path of arahantship (broadly interpreting <i>kāmacchanda</i> as craving for any object). (ii) The escape from <i>ill will</i> occurs by suppression through the first jhāna based on loving-kindness, and by eradication through the path of the non-returner. (iii) The escape from <i>dullness and drowsiness</i> occurs by suppression through the perception of light (the visualization of a bright light) and by eradication through the path of arahantship. (iv) The escape from <i>restlessness and remorse</i> occurs by suppression through serenity—<i>remorse</i> being then eradicated through the path of the non-returner and <i>restlessness</i> through the path of arahantship. And (v) the escape from <i>doubt</i> occurs by suppression through the defining of phenomena <i>(dhammavavatthāna</i>; see Vism 587–93, Ppn 18.3–24) and by eradication through the path of stream-entry. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> does not apply "escape in a particular respect" to the last four hindrances, but Mp-ṭ says it occurs in that the hindrances can be dispelled by reflection <i>(paṭisaṅkhānavasena tassa vinodetabbatāya tadaṅganissaraṇampi labbhat’eva)</i>.</span></span></span> on that occasion one does not know and see as it really is one's own good, the good of others, and the good of both.<span class="note" id="n1193"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1193] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> interprets these terms from a monastic perspective.
