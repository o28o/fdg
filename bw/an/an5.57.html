<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>"Bhikkhus, there are these five themes that should often be reflected upon by a woman or a man, by a householder or one gone forth.<span class="note" id="n1058"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1058] The first three themes echo <a href="../an/an3.39.html">AN3.39</a>, with which this sutta has much in common.</span></span></span> What five? (1) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.’ (2) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness.’ (3) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death.’ (4) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.72"></a> thus: ‘I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me.’<span class="note" id="n1059"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1059] <i>Sabbehi me piyehi manāpehi</i>. I use "everyone and everything" to cover both persons and possessions. The Pāli implies both, but in English we need two words to span both objects.</span></span></span> (5) A woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.’</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>(1) "For the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age’? In their youth beings are intoxicated with their youth, and when they are intoxicated with their youth they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with youth is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to old age; I am not exempt from old age.’</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>(2) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness’? In a state of health beings are intoxicated with their health, and when they are intoxicated with their health they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with health is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to illness; I am not exempt from illness.’</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>(3) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death’? During their lives beings are intoxicated with life, and when they are intoxicated with life they engage in misconduct by body, speech, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.73"></a> and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the intoxication with life is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am subject to death; I am not exempt from death.’</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>(4) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: ‘I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me’? Beings have desire and lust in regard to those people and things that are dear and agreeable, and excited by this lust, they engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, the desire and lust in regard to everyone and everything dear and agreeable is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I must be parted and separated from everyone and everything dear and agreeable to me.’</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>(5) "And for the sake of what benefit should a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, often reflect thus: ‘I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do’? People engage in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. But when one often reflects upon this theme, such misconduct is either completely abandoned or diminished. It is for the sake of this benefit that a woman or a man, a householder or one gone forth, should often reflect thus: ‘I am the owner of my kamma, the heir of my kamma; I have kamma as my origin, kamma as my relative, kamma as my resort; I will be the heir of whatever kamma, good or bad, that I do.’</p>

All beings that come and go, that pass away and undergo rebirth, are subject to old age; none are exempt from old age.’ As he often reflects on this theme, the path is generated. He pursues this path, develops it, and cultivates it. As he does so, the fetters are entirely abandoned and the underlying tendencies are uprooted.<span class="note" id="n1060"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1060] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "<i>The path is generated</i> <i>(maggo sañjāyati)</i>: the world-transcending path is generated. <i>The fetters are entirely abandoned</i> <i>(saṁyojanāni sabbaso pahīyanti)</i>: the ten fetters are entirely abandoned (see <a href="../an/an10.13.html">AN10.13</a>). <i>The underlying tendencies are uprooted</i> <i>(anusayā byantīhonti)</i>: the seven underlying tendencies are removed, cut off, terminated (see <a href="../an/an7.11.html">AN7.11</a>).

<p class="verse" id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Worldlings subject to illness,<span class="note" id="n1061"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1061] These verses are also at <a href="../an/an3.39.html">AN3.39</a>. They seem to be a self-reproach spoken by the bodhisatta prior to his enlightenment and thus fit better there. The line below—"while I am dwelling thus" <i>(mama evaṁ vihārino)</i>—suggests that this is the bodhisatta speaking with reference to his struggle for enlightenment. In pāda c I read with <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> <i>yathādhammā tathāsantā</i>, as against Be and Ee <i>yathā dhammā tathā sattā</i> (though they both concur with Ce in their reading of the earlier sutta).</span></span></span>
