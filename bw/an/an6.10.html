<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in the Banyan Tree Park. Then Mahānāma the Sakyan approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to the Blessed One:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Mahānāma, a noble disciple <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.285"></a> who has arrived at the fruit and understood the teaching often dwells in this way:<span class="note" id="n1257"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1257] The six recollections to follow are commented on in detail in Vism chap. 7.</span></span></span></p>

<p>(1) "Here, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata thus: ‘The Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in true knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Tathāgata, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Tathāgata. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population,<span class="note" id="n1258"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1258] <i>Visamagatāya pajāya samappatto</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "Among beings who have become unbalanced <i>(visamagatesu)</i> through lust, hatred, and delusion, he has attained peace and calmness <i>(samaṁ upasamaṁ patto hutv</i>ā)." From this, it is obvious that <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> takes Pāli <i>sama</i> to be equivalent to Skt <i>śama</i>, peace. But since the text establishes a contrast between <i>visama</i>, the imbalance (or unrighteousness) in which ordinary people live, and the <i>sama</i> that the noble disciple has attained, it is more likely that Pāli <i>sama</i> corresponds to Skt <i>sama</i>. Two Chinese parallels support this supposition. SĀ² 156, at T II 432c<small>15–16</small>, has <img alt="" src="images/000097.jpg" class="calibre93"/> ("Whether his enemies or his relatives, toward these two types of people he has no thought of hostility but his mind is balanced"). The other, T 1537.8 at T XXVI 492c<small>13–15</small>, has <img alt="" src="images/000080.jpg" class="calibre94"/> ("Amid unbalanced sentient beings, he obtains balance; among afflicted sentient beings he dwells without affliction"). Though contradicting the interpretation of <i>sama</i> offered by <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp,</a> this confirms the evident meaning of the sutta.</span></span></span> who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma,<span class="note" id="n1259"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1259] <i>Dhammasotaṁ samāpanno</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "He has entered the stream of the Dhamma consisting in insight." Since the Pāli expression can easily be contracted to <i>sotāpanna</i>, I do not see why <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> interprets <i>dhammasota</i> as insight <i>(vipassanā)</i> rather than the noble path <i>(ariyamagga)</i>. In SN <a href="../sn/sn55.5.html">55:5</a>, at V 347,<small>24–25</small>, <i>sota</i> is used as a metaphor for the noble eightfold path.</span></span></span> he develops recollection of the Buddha.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>(2) "Again, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma thus: ‘The Dhamma is well expounded by the Blessed One, directly visible, immediate, inviting one to come and see, applicable, to be personally experienced by the wise.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Dhamma, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Dhamma. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.286"></a> As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of the Dhamma.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>(3) "Again, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha thus: ‘The Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples is practicing the good way, practicing the straight way, practicing the true way, practicing the proper way; that is, the four pairs of persons, the eight types of individuals—this Saṅgha of the Blessed One's disciples is worthy of gifts, worthy of hospitality, worthy of offerings, worthy of reverential salutation, the unsurpassed field of merit for the world.’ When a noble disciple recollects the Saṅgha, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the Saṅgha. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of the Saṅgha.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>(4) "Again, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects his own virtuous behavior as unbroken, flawless, unblemished, unblotched, freeing, praised by the wise, ungrasped, leading to concentration. When a noble disciple recollects his virtuous behavior, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on virtuous behavior. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.287"></a> This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of virtuous behavior.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>(5) "Again, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects his own generosity thus: ‘It is truly my good fortune and gain that in a population obsessed by the stain of miserliness, I dwell at home with a mind devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing.’ When a noble disciple recollects his generosity, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on generosity. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population. As one who has entered the stream of the Dhamma, he develops recollection of generosity.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>(6) "Again, Mahānāma, a noble disciple recollects the deities thus: ‘There are devas <span class="add">ruled by</span> the four great kings, Tāvatiṁsa devas, Yāma devas, Tusita devas, devas who delight in creation, devas who control what is created by others, devas of Brahmā's company, and devas still higher than these.<span class="note" id="n1260"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1260] The first six are the deities of the six sense-sphere heavens. The devas of Brahmā's company <i>(brahmakāyikā devā)</i> are the deities of the brahmā world. The "devas still higher than these" are the higher devas in the form and formless realms.</span></span></span> There exists in me too such faith as those deities possessed because of which, when they passed away here, they were reborn there; there exists in me too such virtuous behavior … such learning … such generosity … such wisdom as those deities possessed because of which, when they passed away here, they were reborn there.’ When <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.288"></a> a noble disciple recollects the faith, virtuous behavior, learning, generosity, and wisdom in himself and in those deities, on that occasion his mind is not obsessed by lust, hatred, or delusion; on that occasion his mind is simply straight, based on the deities. A noble disciple whose mind is straight gains inspiration in the meaning, gains inspiration in the Dhamma, gains joy connected with the Dhamma. When he is joyful, rapture arises. For one with a rapturous mind, the body becomes tranquil. One tranquil in body feels pleasure. For one feeling pleasure, the mind becomes concentrated. This is called a noble disciple who dwells in balance amid an unbalanced population, who dwells unafflicted amid an afflicted population.
