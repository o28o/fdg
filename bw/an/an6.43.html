<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Sāvatthī for alms. When he had walked for alms in Sāvatthī, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "Come, Ānanda, let us go to Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.345"></a> to pass the day."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the Blessed One, together with the Venerable Ānanda, went to Migāramātā's Mansion in the Eastern Park.</p>

<p>Then in the evening the Blessed One emerged from seclusion and addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "Come, Ānanda, let us go to the eastern gate to bathe."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied.</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One, together with the Venerable Ānanda, went to the eastern gate to bathe. Having bathed at the eastern gate and come out, he stood in one robe drying himself.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>On that occasion, King Pasenadi of Kosala's bull elephant<span class="note" id="n1316"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1316] The various applications of the word <i>nāga</i> will be explained just below. King's Pasenadi's bull elephant was called "Seta" ("White") because its body was white.</span></span></span> named "Seta" was coming out through the eastern gate to the accompaniment of instrumental music and drumming. People saw him and said: "The king's bull elephant is handsome! The king's bull elephant is beautiful! The king's bull elephant is graceful! The king's bull elephant is massive! He's a nāga, truly a nāga."</p>

<p>When this was said, the Venerable Udāyī said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, is it only when people see an elephant possessed of a large massive body that they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ or do people also say this when they see (other) things possessed of a large massive body?"</p>

<p>"(1) Udāyī, when people see an elephant possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (2) When people see a horse possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (3) When people see a bull possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (4) When people see a serpent possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (5) When people see a tree <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.346"></a> possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ (6) When people see a human being possessed of a large massive body, they say: ‘A nāga, truly a nāga!’ But, Udāyī, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I call one a nāga who does no evil by body, speech, and mind."<span class="note" id="n1317"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1317] A pun is intended here. The Buddha’s statement—<i>āguṁ na karoti</i>—playfully derives the word <i>nāga</i> from <i>na</i> + <i>āguṁ</i>, "no evil." <i>Nāga</i> thus becomes an epithet for the Buddha, or, more broadly, for any arahant. See Sn<i>Āguṁ na karoti kiñci loke</i> … <i>nāgo tādi pavuccate tathattā</i> ("One who does no evil in the world … the stable one is for such a reason called a nāga"). See too <a href="../tha/tha21.html#p1249">Th&nbsp;1249</a> (= SN <a href="../sn/sn8.8.html">8:8</a>, I 192,<small>34</small>): <i>Nāganāmo'si bhagavā</i> ("You are named Nāga, O Blessed One").</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"It's astounding and amazing, Bhante, how well this was stated by the Blessed One: ‘But, Udāyī, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I call one a nāga who does no evil by body, speech, and mind.’ I rejoice, Bhante, in this good statement of the Blessed One with these verses:<span class="note" id="n1318"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1318] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> identifies this Udāyī with Kāludāyī. However, the same verses at <a href="../tha/tha15.html#p689">Th&nbsp;689–704</a> are ascribed simply to Udāyī, while a different set of verses in Th (527–36) is ascribed to Kāludāyī. This proves that Mp's identification of the poet cannot be correct. There is a Chinese parallel of this sutta, MĀ 118 (at T I 608b<small>2</small> –609a<small>3</small>), which at several points proved helpful in my reading of the Pāli verses.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="verse" id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"A human being who is fully enlightened,
<br>self-tamed and concentrated,
<br>traveling on the path of brahmā,
<br>he takes delight in peace of mind.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"I have heard from the Arahant
<br>that even the devas pay homage to him,

<br>the one who has gone beyond everything.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"He has transcended all fetters

Ce and Ee have <i>nibbānam</i> in place of <i>nibbanam</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> draws out the word play: "From the jungle of defilements, he has come to a clearing; he has reached nibbāna, devoid of the jungle of defilements" <i>(kilesavanato nibbanaṁ kilesavanarahitaṁ nibbānaṁ āgataṁ sampattaṁ)</i>. It seems that Ce and Ee have transposed <i>nibbāna</i> from the gloss into the text itself. The Chinese at T I 608c<small>2</small> has "from the woods he has left the woods <img alt="" src="images/000069.jpg" class="calibre96"/>," which supports the Be reading.</span></span></span>
<br>delighting in renunciation of sensual pleasures,
<br>he is like pure gold freed from its ore.</p>

<p class="verse" id="note1320"><span class="parno">8</span>"He is the nāga who outshines all,
<br>like the Himalayas amid the other mountains.
<br>Among all things named nāga,

The Chinese (at T I 608c<small>7</small>) has <img alt="" src="images/000095.jpg" class="calibre97"/>, "he is the nāga among all nāgas, in truth the nāga who is unsurpassed."</span></span></span></p>

<p class="verse" id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"I will extol for you the nāga:
<br>indeed, he does no evil.
<br>Mildness and harmlessness
<br>are two feet of the nāga.</p>

<br>Faith is the great nāga's trunk,
<br>and equanimity his ivory tusks.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Mindfulness is his neck, his head is wisdom,
<br>investigation, and reflection on phenomena.<span class="note" id="n1322"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1322] <i>Sati gīvā siro paññā vīmaṁsā dhammacintanā</i>. I translate the terms quite literally. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp,</a> however, says: "The tip of the elephant's trunk is called investigation <i>(vīmaṁsā)</i> because (it investigates) things to determine whether they are hard or soft, edible or inedible, etc. He then rejects whatever should be rejected and takes whatever should be taken. So, for the Buddha-nāga, <i>reflection on phenomena</i> <i>(dhammacintanā)</i>—referring to his knowledge that determines the classes of phenomena—is his (means of) investigation. With this knowledge he knows who is capable and who incapable." The Chinese at 608c<small>11</small> renders the line in a more straightforward way: <img alt="" src="images/000093.jpg" class="calibre98"/>, "wisdom is his head, reflection on and discrimination of phenomena."</span></span></span>
<br>Dhamma is the balanced heat of his belly,
<br>and seclusion is his tail.<span class="note" id="n1323"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1323] In pāda c I read <i>samātapo</i> with Be and Ee, as against Ce <i>samāvāpo</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "It is the concentration of the fourth jhāna that is here called <i>dhamma</i>. For it is on this basis that the supernormal powers succeed. Therefore it is called <i>balanced heat of the belly</i> <i>(kucchisamātapo)</i>. <i>Seclusion</i> <i>(viveka)</i> refers to bodily seclusion, mental seclusion, and seclusion from the acquisitions <i>(kāyacittaupadhiviveko)</i>. As the elephant uses its tail to ward off mosquitoes, so the Tathāgata resorts to seclusion to ward off householders and monks." The Chinese reads the couplet (at 608c<small>12</small>) as <img  alt="" src="images/000032.jpg" class="calibre99"/>, "upholding dharmas is his belly, and delight in seclusion is his pair of arms." Apparently in this transmission, <i>vāladhi</i> of the Pāli came down as <i>bāhūni</i>.</span></span></span></p>

The reading is also found at <a href="../tha/tha15.html#p702">Th&nbsp;702</a>. Vanarata points out that "the whole verse <i>is</i> the simile and <i>nibbuto</i> (meaning both an extinguished fire and a person who has attained nibbāna) refers to the fire." The Chinese (at 608c<small>27</small>), in agreement with Th and the Burmese manuscripts, has <img alt="" src="images/000051.jpg" class="calibre100"/>, "Without firewood, the fire does not continue.
