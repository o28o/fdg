<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Then, in the morning, the Venerable Ānanda dressed, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasālā, where he sat down on the seat prepared for him. Then the female lay disciple Migasālā approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:</p>

Confusion of <i>s</i> and <i>p</i> is not unusual in Sinhalascript manuscripts. However, the gloss in <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp,</a> <i>sakadāgāmipuggalo hutvā</i>, suggests that the commentator used a text with the reading <i>sakadāgāmī satto</i>. It is not impossible that the corruption (if it is one) dates back before the age of the commentaries.</span></span></span> and has been reborn in the Tusita group (of devas).’ My paternal uncle<span class="note" id="n1330"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1330] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> and Be <i>petteyyopi</i>; Ee <i>petteyyo piyo</i>. The only meaning PED assigns <i>petteyya</i> is "showing filial piety toward one's father," which does not fit here. We should probably read here <i>pettāpiyo</i>, which PED defines as "father's brother, paternal uncle." In the version at <a href="../an/an10.75.html">AN10.75</a>, Ce has <i>pettā pi yo</i> and Ee <i>pettā piyo</i>, which, by closing the spaces, would both give the desired reading. In <a href="../mn/mn89.html#p10">MN89</a>, Purāṇa and Isidatta are said to have been in the employment of King Pasenadi of Kosala but to have shown greater respect toward the Buddha than toward the king. Their love for the Buddha is expressed in <a href="../sn/sn55.6.html">SN55:6</a>.</span></span></span> Isidatta was not celibate but lived a contented married life. When he died, the Blessed One also declared: ‘He attained to the state of a once-returner and has been reborn in the Tusita group <span class="add">of devas</span>.’ Bhante Ānanda, just how should this teaching of the Blessed One be understood, where one who is celibate and one who is not celibate both have exactly the same destination in their future life?"</p>

<p>"It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it."<span class="note" id="n1331"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1331] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "Ānanda said this because he did not know the reason." Brahmāli writes: "I understand Ānanda to simply be saying that it should be understood just as the Buddha explained it," and he suggests rendering the sentence: "Just so, sister, as this was declared by the Blessed One." However, at this point the Buddha’s pronouncements on their destiny have not yet been explained. The explanation comes only at the end of the sutta, when the Buddha extols the respective strong points of the two deceased lay disciples.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p3-4"><span class="parno">3-4</span>Then, when the Venerable Ānanda had received almsfood at Migasālā's house, he rose from his seat and departed. After his meal, on returning from his alms round, he went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Here, Bhante, in the morning, I dressed, took my bowl and robe, and went to the house of the female lay follower Migasālā … <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.349"></a> <span class="add">all as above, down to</span> … When she asked me this, I replied: ‘It was just in this way, sister, that the Blessed One declared it.’"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span><span class="add">The Blessed One said:</span> "Who, indeed, is the female lay follower Migasālā, a foolish, incompetent woman with a woman's intellect?<span class="note" id="n1332"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1332] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> <i>ambakapaññā;</i> Be here has <i>ammakasaññā,</i> "a woman's perception" or "a woman's idea," but the Be text of <a href="../an/an10.75.html">AN10.75</a> reads <i>ammakapaññā</i>. Ee has <i>ambakasaññā</i> here but <i>ambakapaññā</i> in the concluding paragraph. Apparently Ee's former reading is a typographical error for the latter, since on the first occurrence <i>saññā</i> is cited as a variant in the notes. Again, the common <i>s</i>/<i>p</i> confusion must lie behind the variants. <i>Ambaka</i> in Ce and Ee (or Be <i>ammaka)</i> is derived from <i>ammā</i>, "mother," but with the more general meaning of women. Mp-ṭ explains: "<i>Ammakā</i> (or <i>ambakā)</i> means women (lit., the class of mothers). This is a metaphorical term. That is, mothers, the class of mothers, maternal parents, are found among women" <i>(Ammakāti mātugāmo. Upacāravacanañh’etaṁ. Itthīsu yadidaṁ ammakā mātugāmo jananī janikā)</i>. SED sv <i>ambā</i> has "a mother, good woman (as a title of respect)." And under <i>ambikā</i>: "mother, good woman (as a term of respect)." The Chinese parallel at T II 258c<small>8–9</small>, does not include the derogatory generalization about women, but states the matter with reference to Migasālā as an individual: "The lay follower Migasālā is foolish and has little wisdom" (<img alt="" src="images/000087.jpg" class="calibre103"/>).</span></span></span> And who are those <span class="add">who have</span> the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior?<span class="note" id="n1333"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1333] The juxtaposition of nominative <i>ke</i> with locative <i> –ñāṇe</i> is puzzling. I take the sense to be that those referred to by <i>ke</i> are established <i>in</i> this knowledge. Perhaps, though, <i> –ñāṇe</i> is a residual eastern form, a nominative plural in agreement with <i>ke</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> does not attempt to resolve this problem, but when commenting on "in the knowledge of other persons as superior and inferior" <i>(purisapuggalaparopariyañāṇe)</i>, it explains this knowledge as "the knowledge of other persons’ superior and inferior faculties by way of their sharpness or dullness" <i>(purisapuggalānaṁ tikkhamuduvasena indriyaparopariyañāṇaṁ)</i>.</span></span></span></p>
