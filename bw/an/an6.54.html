<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. On that occasion the Venerable Dhammika was the resident monk in his native district, in all the seven monasteries in his native district.<span class="note" id="n1359"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1359] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> does not give information about him and he does not appear elsewhere in the Nikāyas.</span></span></span> There the Venerable Dhammika insulted visiting bhikkhus, reviled them, harmed them, attacked them, and scolded them, and then those visiting bhikkhus left. They did not settle down but vacated the monastery.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then it occurred to the lay followers of the native district: "We serve the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, but the visiting bhikkhus leave. They do not settle down but vacate the monastery. Why is that so?"</p>

<p>Then it occurred to them: "This Venerable Dhammika insults visiting bhikkhus, reviles them, harms them, attacks them, and scolds them, and then those visiting bhikkhus leave. They do not settle down but vacate the monastery. Let's banish the Venerable Dhammika."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then the lay followers went to the Venerable Dhammika and said to him: "Bhante, leave this monastery. You’ve stayed here long enough."</p>

<p>The Venerable Dhammika then went from that monastery to another one, where again he insulted visiting bhikkhus, reviled them, harmed them, attacked them, and scolded them. And then those visiting bhikkhus left. They did not settle down <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.367"></a> but vacated the monastery.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">4-5</span>Then it occurred to the lay followers … <span class="add">all as above</span> … and said to him: "Bhante, leave this monastery. You’ve stayed here long enough."</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Venerable Dhammika went from that monastery to still another one, where again he insulted visiting bhikkhus …. They did not settle down but vacated the monastery.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Then it occurred to the lay followers: "We serve the Saṅgha of bhikkhus with robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, but the visiting bhikkhus leave. They do not settle down but vacate the monastery. Why is that so?"</p>

<p>Then it occurred to the lay followers: "This Venerable Dhammika insults visiting bhikkhus …. They do not settle down <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.368"></a> but vacate the monastery. Let's banish the Venerable Dhammika from all the seven monasteries in the native district."</p>

<p>Then the lay followers of the native district went to the Venerable Dhammika and said to him: "Bhante, depart from all the seven monasteries in the native district."</p>

<p>The Venerable Dhammika then thought: "I am banished by the lay followers from all seven monasteries here. Where shall I go?"</p>

<p>It then occurred to him: "Let me go to the Blessed One."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then the Venerable Dhammika took his bowl and robe and left for Rājagaha. Gradually he reached Rājagaha, and then went to Mount Vulture Peak, where he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then asked him: "Where are you coming from, Brahmin Dhammika?"<span class="note" id="n1360"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1360] Strangely, neither <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> nor Mp-ṭ explains why the Buddha refers to Dhammika as <i>brāhmaṇa</i>. This may be the only place in the Nikāyas where the Buddha refers to a bhikkhu as a brahmin followed by his personal name.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Bhante, the lay followers of my native district have banished me from all seven monasteries there."</p>

<p>"Enough, Brahmin Dhammika! Now that you’ve come to me, why be concerned that you have been banished from those places?</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>In the past, Brahmin Dhammika, some seafaring merchants set out to sea in a ship, taking along a land-spotting bird. When the ship had still not caught sight of land they released the bird. It went to the east, the west, the north, the south, upward, and to the intermediate directions. If it saw land anywhere, it went straight for it. But if it didn’t see land, it returned to the ship. In the same way, when you have been banished from those places, you’ve come to me." <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.369"></a></p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"In the past, Brahmin Dhammika, King Koravya had a royal banyan tree named ‘Well Grounded,’ which had five branches, cast a cool shade, and gave delight. Its canopy extended for twelve <i>yojanas</i>; its network of roots for five <i>yojanas</i>. Its fruits were as large as cooking pots and as sweet as pure honey. The king and his harem made use of one section of the tree, the army used another section, the townfolk and countryfolk used still another, ascetics and brahmins used still another, and the beasts and birds used still another. No one guarded the tree's fruits, yet no one took another's fruits.</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Then, Brahmin Dhammika, a certain man ate as much as he wanted of the tree's fruits, broke off a branch, and left. It occurred to the deity who lived in the tree: ‘It's astounding and amazing how evil this man is! He ate as much as he wanted of the tree's fruits, broke off a branch, and left! Let me see to it that in the future the royal banyan tree does not yield fruit.’ Then in the future the royal banyan tree did not yield fruit.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Thereupon <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.370"></a> King Koravya approached Sakka the ruler of the devas and said to him: ‘Listen, respected sir, you should know that the royal banyan tree does not yield fruit.’</p>

<p>"Then Sakka the ruler of the devas performed a feat of psychic potency such that a violent rainstorm came and twisted<span class="note" id="n1361"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1361] Reading with Ce and Be <i>pavattesi</i>, as against Ee <i>pātesi</i>, "felled," also cited as a variant in Ce and Be. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses <i>pavattesi</i> with <i>parivattesi</i>.</span></span></span> and uprooted the royal banyan tree.</p>

<p>"Then, Brahmin Dhammika, the deity that lived in the tree stood to one side, sad and miserable, weeping with a tearful face.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>Sakka approached this deity and said: ‘Why, deity, do you stand to one side, sad and miserable, weeping with a tearful face?’ – ‘It is, sir, because a violent rainstorm came and twisted and uprooted my dwelling.’ – ‘But, deity, were you following the duty of a tree when the violent rainstorm came and twisted and uprooted your dwelling?’ – ‘But how, sir, does a tree follow the duty of a tree?’ – ‘Here, deity, those who need roots take its roots; those who need bark take its bark; those who need leaves take its leaves; those who need flowers take its flowers; and those who need fruit take its fruit. Yet because of this the deity does not become displeased or discontent. That's how a tree follows the duty of a tree.’ – ‘Sir, I wasn’t following the duty of a tree when the violent rainstorm came and twisted and uprooted my dwelling.’ – ‘If, deity, you would follow the duty of a tree, your dwelling might return to its former state.’ – ‘I will, sir, follow <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.371"></a> the duty of a tree. Let my dwelling be as before.’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"Then, Brahmin Dhammika, Sakka the ruler of the devas performed such a feat of psychic potency that a violent rainstorm came and turned upright the royal banyan tree and its roots were covered with bark. So too, Brahmin Dhammika, were you following the duty of an ascetic when the lay followers of the native district banished you from all seven monasteries?"</p>

<p>"But how, Bhante, does an ascetic follow the duty of an ascetic?"</p>

<p>"Here, Brahmin Dhammika, an ascetic does not insult one who insults him, does not scold one who scolds him, and does not argue with one who argues with him. That is how an ascetic follows the duty of an ascetic."</p>

<p>"Bhante, I wasn’t following the duty of an ascetic when the lay followers banished me from all seven monasteries."</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>(1) "In the past, Brahmin Dhammika, there was a teacher named Sunetta, the founder of a spiritual sect, one without lust for sensual pleasures.

Sv II 670,<small>13–14</small> says: "‘He taught the path to disciples for companionship with the brahmā world’: that is, he explained the path to fellowship with Brahmā in the brahmā world" <i>(sāvakānañca brahmalokasahabyatāya maggaṁ desesī ti brahmaloke brahmunā sahabhāvāya maggaṁ kathesi)</i>.</span></span></span> When he was teaching such a Dhamma, those who did not place confidence in him were, with the breakup of the body, after death, reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but those who placed confidence in him were reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world.</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"What do you think, Brahmin Dhammika?

<p>"Yes, Bhante."</p>

<p>"If, with a mind of hatred, one had insulted and reviled these six teachers together with their communities of disciples, one would have generated much demerit.

I say, Brahmin Dhammika, there is no injury<span class="note" id="n1364"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1364] Brahmāli called my attention to an entry in DOP (p. 744) for a noun <i>khanti<sup>2</sup></i>, meaning "hurt, injury," presumably derived from the verb <i>khaṇati<sup>1</sup></i>, "hurts, injures, impairs." This word is <i>not</i> the Pāli equivalent of Skt <i>kṣānti</i> (DOP <i>khanti<sup>1</sup>)</i>, "patience" or "acceptance." <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses <i>khanti</i> here as "digging up one's own virtues" <i>(attano guṇakhaṇanaṁ)</i>, but DOP points out that the commentaries tend to conflate <i>khaṇati<sup>1</sup></i>, "injures," with <i>khaṇati<sup>2</sup></i>, "digs up." The Skt equivalent of <i>khanti<sup>2</sup></i> may be <i>kṣhati</i>, from <i>kṣaṇoti</i>, "hurts, injures, wounds"; see SED sv <i>kshan</i>.</span></span></span> against outsiders<span class="note" id="n1365"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1365] <i>Ito bahiddhā</i>. That is, those outside the Buddhist community.</span></span></span> like that against <span class="add">your</span> fellow monks. Therefore, Brahmin Dhammika, you should train yourself thus: ‘We will not let hatred arise in our minds toward our fellow monks.’<span class="note" id="n1366"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1366] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> <i>na no āmasabrahmacārisu</i>, Be <i>na no samasabrahmacārisu</i>, Ee <i>na no sabrahmacārisu</i>. DOP sv <i>āma<sup>3</sup></i> has "in or of the same house; belonging to the same house" and cites <i>āmasabrahmacāri</i><i>(n)</i> as meaning "a fellow religious student belonging to the same house or community." However, it gives this passage as the sole reference, and the term does not seem to occur elsewhere in the Nikāyas. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> Ce accepts the unusual reading and says: <i>Na no āmasabrahmacārīsū ti ettha āmajano</i> [Be: <i>samajano</i>] <i>nāma sakajano vuccati</i>. <i>Tasmā na no sakesu samānabrahmacārīsu cittāni paduṭṭhāni bhavissantī ti ayamettha attho</i> ("<i>Toward our fellow monks of the same house</i>: Here, it is one's own people that are called ‘people of the same house.’ Therefore the meaning here is: ‘There should be no thoughts of hatred toward one's own fellow monks.’"). The passage recurs at <a href="../an/an7.73.html">AN7.73</a>, but with the unaugmented <i>sabrahmacārisu</i>. I suspect that the augmented forms found in the Ce and Be versions of this sutta are the product of an ancient transmission error that was accepted as authentic by the commentator. I therefore treat the text as reading simply <i>sabrahmacārisu</i>.</span></span></span> Thus, Brahmin Dhammika, should you train yourself." <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.373"></a></p>
