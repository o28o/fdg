<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Now on that occasion the Venerable Soṇa was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Cool Grove.<span class="note" id="n1367"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1367] This is Soṇa Koḷivīsa, declared by the Buddha foremost among those who arouse energy (see <a href="../an/an1.198-208.html">AN1.205</a>). His verses are at <a href="../tha/tha13.html">Th&nbsp;632–44</a>. <a href="../tha/tha13.html#p638">Th&nbsp;638–39</a> refer to the simile of the lute; <a href="../tha/tha13.html#p640">Th&nbsp;640–44</a> are identical with the verses at the end of this sutta. The story of Soṇa appears in an expanded version at <a href="../vi/kd5.html">Khandaka 5</a>, where it leads to the Buddha’s granting permission to the monks to wear sandals.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then, while the Venerable Soṇa was alone in seclusion, the following course of thought arose in his mind: "I am one of the Blessed One's most energetic disciples, yet my mind has not been liberated from the taints by non-clinging. Now there is wealth in my family, and it is possible for me to enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds. Let me then give up the training and return to the lower life, so that I can enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then, having known with his own mind the course of thought in the Venerable Soṇa's mind, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Blessed One disappeared on Mount Vulture Peak and appeared in the Cool Grove in the presence of the Venerable Soṇa. The Blessed One sat down on the seat prepared for him. The Venerable Soṇa paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then said to him: <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.375"></a></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Soṇa, when you were alone in seclusion, didn’t the following course of thought arise in your mind: ‘I am one of the Blessed One's most energetic disciples, yet my mind has not been liberated from the taints by non-clinging. Now there is wealth in my family, and it is possible for me to enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds. Let me then give up the training and return to the lower life, so that I can enjoy my wealth and do meritorious deeds’?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Tell me, Soṇa, in the past, when you lived at home, weren’t you skilled at the lute?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante."</p>

<hr>
<p>"What do you think, Soṇa? When its strings were too tight, was your lute well tuned and easy to play?"</p>

<p>"No, Bhante."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"When its strings were too loose, was your lute well tuned and easy to play?"</p>

<p>"No, Bhante."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"But, Soṇa, when its strings were neither too tight nor too loose but adjusted to a balanced pitch, was your lute well tuned and easy to play?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"So too, Soṇa, if energy is aroused too forcefully this leads to restlessness, and if energy is too lax this leads to laziness. Therefore, Soṇa, resolve on a balance of energy, achieve evenness of the spiritual faculties, and take up the object there."<span class="note" id="n1368"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1368] Reading with <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> and Ee: <i>Viriyasamataṃ adhiṭṭhaha, indriyānaṃ ca samataṃ paṭivijjha, tattha ca nimittaṃ gaṇhāhi.</i> Where Ce and Ee have <i>viriyasamataṃ,</i> Be has <i>vīriyasamathaṃ</i> (but just below, <i>indriyānañca samataṃ</i>). Mp (Ce) also reads <i>viriyasamathaṃ</i> in the lemma. The explanation in Mp seems to support <i>viriyasamathaṃ.</i>

<br class="half">Mp: “Resolve on evenness of energy: Resolve on serenity combined with energy <i>(viriyasampayuttaṃ samathaṃ adhiṭṭhaha).</i> The meaning is, ‘Link energy with serenity.’ Achieve evenness of the spiritual faculties: Keep to evenness, a balance of the spiritual faculties of faith, etc. When faith is linked with wisdom and wisdom with faith; when energy is linked with concentration and concentration with energy, then the balance of the faculties is maintained. But mindfulness is useful everywhere, so it should always be strong…. Seize the object there: When such balance exists, the object can arise clearly, like the reflection of one’s face in a mirror; and you should take up <i>(gaṇhāhi)</i> this object—bring forth <i>(nibbattehi)</i> the object of serenity, of insight, of the path, and of the fruit. Thus the Buddha explained the meditation subject to him, leading up to arahantship.”

<br class="half">Chinese parallels to this passage offer quite different readings of the Buddha’s injunction, as follows: <a href="an0-abbr.html">T I 612a</a><small>28–29</small>: "Therefore you should distinguish this time (could <i>samataṁ</i> have mutated into <i>samayaṁ</i>?), examine this mark, and do not be heedless" (<img alt="" src="images/000004.jpg" class="calibre105"/>); T II 62c<small>17–18</small>: "Therefore you should practice by taking up (the object) in a balanced way; do not cling, do not be heedless, and do not grasp marks" (<img alt="" src="images/000010.jpg" class="calibre106"/>); T II 612b<small><small>19–20</small></small>: "If you can stay in the middle, this is the superior practice" (<img alt="" src="images/000081.jpg" class="calibre108"/>); T XXII 844c<small>1–2</small> is closest to the Pāli: "You should balance your energy, balance the faculties" (<img alt="" src="images/000016.jpg" class="calibre109"/>).</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Soṇa replied.</p>

<p>When the Blessed One had finished giving the Venerable Soṇa this exhortation, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, he disappeared in the Cool Grove and reappeared on Mount Vulture Peak. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.376"></a></p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Then, some time later, the Venerable Soṇa resolved on a balance of energy, achieved evenness of the spiritual faculties, and took up the object there. Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, in no long time the Venerable Soṇa realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, he dwelled in it. He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being." And the Venerable Soṇa became one of the arahants.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Having attained arahantship, the Venerable Soṇa thought: "Let me go to the Blessed One and declare final knowledge in his presence." Then he approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said:</p>
