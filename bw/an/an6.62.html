<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus when he arrived at a Kosalan town named Daṇḍakappaka. Then the Blessed One left the highway and sat down on a seat that was prepared for him at the foot of a tree, and those bhikkhus entered Daṇḍakappaka to search for a rest house.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the Venerable Ānanda together with a number of bhikkhus went down to the Aciravatī River to bathe. Having finished bathing and come back out, he stood in one robe drying his body. Then a certain bhikkhu approached the Venerable Ānanda and said to him: "Friend Ānanda, was it after full consideration that the Blessed One declared of Devadatta: ‘Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for the eon, unredeemable,’ or did he say this only figuratively?"</p>

<p>"It was just in this way, friend, that the Blessed One declared it."<span class="note" id="n1403"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1403] As at <a href="../an/an6.44.html">AN6.44</a>. It seems that this is Ānanda's way of simply confirming that the Buddha had said something without committing himself to an interpretation of the statement.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and <span class="add">reported what had happened, ending</span>: <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.403"></a> "When this was said, Bhante, I said to that bhikkhu: ‘It was just in this way, friend, that the Blessed One declared it.’"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span><span class="add">The Blessed One said:</span> "Ānanda, that bhikkhu must be either newly ordained, not long gone forth, or a foolish and incompetent elder. For when this was declared by me definitively, how can he see any ambiguity in it?<span class="note" id="n1404"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1404] <i>Kathañhi nāma yaṁ mayā ekaṁsena byākataṁ tattha dvejjhā āpajjissati</i>. The Buddha’s statement here belongs to his first way of answering a question, namely, by making a categorical assertion. On the four ways of answering a question, see <a href="../an/an3.67.html">AN3.67</a>, <a href="../an/an4.42.html">AN4.42</a>.</span></span></span> I do not see even one other person, Ānanda, about whom I have made a declaration after giving him such full consideration as Devadatta. As long as I saw even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of a bright quality in Devadatta, I did not declare of him: ‘Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable.’ It was, Ānanda, only when I did not see even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of a bright quality<span class="note" id="n1405"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1405] <i>Vālaggakoṭinittudanamattampi sukkadhammaṁ</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "An amount that could be seen on the tip of a hair; or an amount that could be poked with the tip of a hair."</span></span></span> in Devadatta that I declared this of him.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Suppose there was a cesspit deeper than a man's height full of feces right up to the top, and a man was sunk in it so that his head was submerged. Then a man would appear desiring his good, welfare, and security, wishing to pull him out from the cesspit. He would go around the cesspit on all sides but would not see even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of the man not smeared with feces <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.404"></a> where he might get a grip and pull him out. So too, Ānanda, it was only when I did not see even a mere fraction of a hair's tip of a bright quality in Devadatta that I declared of him: ‘Devadatta is bound for the plane of misery, bound for hell, and he will remain there for an eon, unredeemable.’</p>

<p>"If, Ānanda, you would listen to the Tathāgata's knowledges of a person's faculties, I will analyze them."<span class="note" id="n1406"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1406] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> and Ee have <i>vibhajantassa</i>, as against Be <i>vibhajissāmi</i>, which Ee notes as a variant from a Burmese manuscript. The Be reading seems a normalization, but since the Ce/Ee reading leaves the sentence grammatically incomplete, I follow Be. The plural <i> –ñāṇāni</i> is in the text, and thus I use the plural "knowledges" even though it sounds odd in English.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"It is the time for this, Blessed One! It is the time for this, Fortunate One! The Blessed One should analyze his knowledges of a person's faculties. Having heard this from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Well then, Ānanda, listen and attend closely. I will speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>(1) "Here, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand some person thus: ‘Wholesome qualities and unwholesome qualities are found in this person.’ On a later occasion, having encompassed his mind with my own mind, I understand him thus: ‘This person's wholesome qualities have disappeared, unwholesome qualities are manifest, but he has a wholesome root that has not been eradicated. From that wholesome root<span class="note" id="n1407"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1407] I read with <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> <i>kusalamūlā</i>, as against Be and Ee <i>kusalā</i>.</span></span></span> of his the wholesome will appear. Thus this person will not be subject to decline in the future.’ Suppose seeds that are intact, unspoiled, not damaged by wind and the sun's heat, fecund, well preserved, were deposited in well-prepared soil in a good field.

<p>"Yes, Bhante."</p>

<p>"In the same way, Ānanda, having encompassed his mind with my own mind … <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iii.405"></a> … I understand him thus: ‘This person's wholesome qualities have disappeared, unwholesome qualities are manifest, but he has a wholesome root that has not been eradicated. From that wholesome root of his the wholesome will appear. Thus this person will not be subject to decline in the future.’ In this way, Ānanda, the Tathāgata knows a person by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata has knowledge of a person's faculties, acquired by encompassing his mind with his own mind. In this way, the Tathāgata knows the future origination of qualities by encompassing <span class="add">another's</span> mind with his own mind.</p>

This person possesses exclusively black, unwholesome qualities.
