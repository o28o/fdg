<p>"There are, bhikkhus, these five objects of sensual pleasure: forms cognizable by the eye that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing; sounds cognizable by the ear … odours cognizable by the nose … tastes cognizable by the tongue … tactile objects cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable, pleasing, connected with sensual pleasure, tantalizing. However, these are not sensual pleasures; in the Noble One's discipline, these are called ‘objects of sensual pleasure.’ A person's sensual pleasure is lustful intention.<span class="note" id="n1411"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1411] Contrary to all three editions, I regard the first occurrence of <i>saṅkapparāgo purisassa kāmo</i> as either prose or a line of a familiar verse being quoted in the prose. The following verse will then be a normal verse of four lines rather than one of five lines. See SN <a >1:34</a>, I 22, where the verse occurs with only four lines. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> explains <i>saṅkapparāgo</i> as "lust arisen by way of intention" <i>(saṅkappavasena uppannarāgo)</i>. <i>Kāmasaṅkappa</i> is one of the three types of unwholesome thought, and it is clear from the context that this is what is meant. For further discussion, see CDB 366, note 72. The verse is not included in the Chinese parallel, MĀ 111.</span></span></span></p>

Sensual desire for forms is one thing, sensual desire for sounds is another, sensual desire for odours still another, sensual desire for tastes still another, and sensual desire for tactile objects still another. This is called the diversity of sensual pleasures.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"And what is the result of sensual pleasures?

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>(4) "When it was said: ‘The taints should be understood … the way leading to the cessation of the taints should be understood,’ for what reason was this said?</p>

<p>"There are, bhikkhus, these three taints: the taint of sensuality, the taint of existence, and the taint of ignorance.</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>"And what is the source and origin of the taints? Ignorance is their source and origin.</p>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>(5) "When it was said: ‘Kamma should be understood … the way leading to the cessation of kamma should be understood,’ for what reason was this said?</p>

<p>"It is volition, bhikkhus, that I call kamma.<span class="note" id="n1417"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1417] <i>Cetanā ‘haṁ bhikkhave kammaṁ vadāmi</i>. This should probably be understood to mean that volition is a necessary factor in creating kamma, not that volition on its own invariably and in all instances creates kamma. It can thus be seen as a counterfoil to the Jain position that any action, even an unintentional one, creates kamma. The Chinese parallel, <a href="an0-abbr.html">MĀ</a> 111, at T I 600a<small>23–24</small>, says: "How does one understand kamma? There are two kinds of kamma: intention and the kamma (created) when one has intended" (<img alt="" src="images/000034.jpg" class="calibre110"/>)..</span></span></span> For having willed, one acts by body, speech, or mind.</p>

<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>"And what is the source and origin of kamma? Contact is its source and origin.</p>

<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>"And what is the diversity of kamma? There is kamma to be experienced in hell; there is kamma to be experienced in the animal realm; there is kamma to be experienced in the realm of afflicted spirits; there is kamma to be experienced in the human world; and there is kamma to be experienced in the deva world.<span class="note" id="n1418"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1418] This statement should be understood in the sense that the results of kamma are to be experienced in their respective realms.</span></span></span> This is called the diversity of kamma.</p>

<p id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>"And what is the result of kamma? The result of kamma, I say, is threefold: <span class="add">to be experienced</span> in this very life, or in the <span class="add">next</span> rebirth, or on some subsequent occasion. This is called the result of kamma.<span class="note" id="n1419"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1419] See <a href="an3.34.html#n372">AN3.34, n.&nbsp;372</a>, and <a href="an3.100.html#n547">AN3.100, n.&nbsp;547</a>. The Chinese parallel, MĀ 111, has here the fourfold distinction of kamma found in <a href="../an/an4.232.html">AN4.232</a> –33. But MĀ 15 (at T I 437b<small>26</small>) speaks of only two kinds of results, in this life or in a later life, without a third alternative.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is the cessation of kamma? With the cessation of contact there is cessation of kamma.<span class="note" id="n1420"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1420] This should probably be understood in the sense that, because contact is the condition for intention and kamma can be explained as intention, contact is therefore the condition for kamma.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"This noble eightfold path is the way leading to the cessation of kamma, namely, right view … right concentration.</p>
