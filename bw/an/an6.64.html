Usually, ten Tathāgata's powers are cited (identified as <i>ñāṇabalāni</i>, powers of knowledge). In AN the ten are in <a href="../an/an10.21.html">AN10.21</a>. They are also at <a href="../mn/mn12.html#p9">MN&nbsp;12.9–20</a>, I 69–71, and analyzed at Vibh 335 — 44 (Be §§809–31).</span></span></span> What six?</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>(2) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it really is the result of the undertaking of kamma past, future, and present in terms of possibilities and causes.<span class="note" id="n1424"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1424] <i>Ṭhānaso hetuso</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> explains possibility <i>(ṭhāna)</i> as condition <i>(paccaya)</i>. Following Vibh 338–39 (Be §810), it takes this to be knowledge of the conditions for kamma bringing a result in connection with four factors that can either reinforce or impede its maturation: realm <i>(gati</i>, one's place of rebirth), acquisitions <i>(upadhi</i>, one's body and mind), time <i>(kāla)</i>, and effort <i>(payoga)</i>. The cause <i>(hetu)</i> is the kamma itself.</span></span></span> Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the result of the undertaking of kamma … this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he … sets in motion the brahma wheel.</p>

The eight <i>emancipations</i> <i>(vimokkha)</i> are at <a href="../an/an8.66.html">AN8.66</a>. The three kinds of <i>concentration</i> <i>(samādhi)</i> are at <a href="../an/an8.63.html">AN8.63</a>: concentration with thought and examination, without thought but with examination only, and without thought and examination. The nine <i>meditative attainments</i> <i>(samāpatti)</i> are the same as the nine progressive dwellings <i>(anupubbavihārā)</i> at <a href="../an/an9.32.html">AN9.32</a>. The <i>defilement</i> <i>(saṁkilesa)</i> is a quality that leads to deterioration; the <i>cleansing</i> <i>(vodāna)</i> is a quality that makes for distinction; and the <i>emergence</i> <i>(vuṭṭhāna)</i>, according to Vibh 342–43 (Be §828), is the cleansing and emergence itself. "Cleansing" here means that proficiency in the lower jhāna is the foundation for the next higher jhāna; "emergence itself" means coming out from the jhāna.</span></span></span> Since the Tathāgata understands as it really is the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas … this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he … sets in motion the brahma wheel.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>(4) "Again, the Tathāgata recollects his manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births … Thus he recollects his manifold past abodes with their aspects and details. Since the Tathāgata recollects his manifold past abodes … with their aspects and details, this too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, possessing which he … sets in motion the brahma wheel.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>(5) "Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Tathāgata sees beings passing away and being reborn … and he understands how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>(6) "Again, with the destruction of the taints, the Tathāgata has realized for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, and having entered upon it, he dwells in it.
