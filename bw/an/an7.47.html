<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now on that occasion the brahmin Uggatasarīra had made arrangements for a great sacrifice. Five hundred bulls had been led to the post<span class="note" id="n1510"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1510] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> says that <i>thūṇa</i> is the sacrificial post itself: <i>yūpasaṅkhātaṁ thūṇaṁ</i>.</span></span></span> for the sacrifice. Five hundred bullocks … Five hundred heifers … Five hundred goats … Five hundred rams had been led to the post for the sacrifice.</p>

<p>Then the brahmin Uggatasarīra approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"I have heard, Master Gotama, that the kindling of the sacrificial fire and the raising of the sacrificial post are of great fruit and benefit."</p>

<p>"I too, brahmin, have heard this."</p>

<p>A second time … A third time the brahmin Uggatasarīra said to the Blessed One: "I have heard, Master Gotama, that the kindling of the sacrificial fire and the raising of the sacrificial post are of great fruit and benefit."</p>

<p>"I too, brahmin, have heard this."</p>

<p>"Then <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.42"></a> Master Gotama and I are in complete and total agreement."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the brahmin Uggatasarīra: "Brahmin, Tathāgatas should not be asked thus: ‘I have heard, Master Gotama, that the kindling of the sacrificial fire and the raising of the sacrificial post are of great fruit and benefit.’ Tathāgatas should be asked: ‘Bhante, I want to kindle the sacrificial fire and raise the sacrificial post. Let the Blessed One exhort me and instruct me in a way that will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time.’"</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the brahmin Uggatasarīra said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, I want to kindle the sacrificial fire and raise the sacrificial post. Let Master Gotama exhort me and instruct me in a way that will lead to my welfare and happiness for a long time."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Brahmin, one kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three knives that are unwholesome and have suffering as their outcome and result. What three? The bodily knife, the verbal knife, and the mental knife.</p>

<p>"Brahmin, one kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, arouses such a thought as this: ‘Let so many bulls be slain in sacrifice! Let so many bullocks … so many heifers … so many goats … so many rams be slain in sacrifice!’ Though he <span class="add">thinks</span>, ‘Let me do merit,’ he does demerit. Though he <span class="add">thinks</span>, ‘Let me do what is wholesome,’ he does what is unwholesome. Though he <span class="add">thinks</span>, ‘Let me seek the path to a good destination,’ he seeks the path to a bad destination. One kindling the sacrificial fire and <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.43"></a> raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises this first knife, the mental one, which is unwholesome and has suffering as its outcome and result.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Again, brahmin, one kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, utters such speech as this: ‘Let so many bulls be slain in sacrifice! Let so many bullocks … so many heifers … so many goats … so many rams be slain in sacrifice!’ Though he <span class="add">thinks</span>, ‘Let me do merit,’ he does demerit. Though he <span class="add">thinks</span>, ‘Let me do what is wholesome,’ he does what is unwholesome. Though he <span class="add">thinks</span>, ‘Let me seek the path to a good destination,’ he seeks the path to a bad destination. One kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises this second knife, the verbal one, which is unwholesome and has suffering as its outcome and result.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Again, brahmin, one kindling the sacrificial fire and raising the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, first undertakes the preparations to slay the bulls in sacrifice. He first undertakes the preparations to slay the bullocks in sacrifice … to slay the heifers in sacrifice … to slay the goats in sacrifice … to slay the rams in sacrifice. Though he <span class="add">thinks</span>, ‘Let me do merit,’ he does demerit. Though he <span class="add">thinks</span>, ‘Let me do what is wholesome,’ he does what is unwholesome. Though he <span class="add">thinks</span>, ‘Let me seek the path to a good destination,’ he seeks the path to a bad destination.

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>(1) "And why should the fire of lust be abandoned and avoided and not be cultivated? One excited by lust, overcome by lust, with mind obsessed by it, engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. As a consequence, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. Therefore this fire of lust should be abandoned and avoided and should not be cultivated.</p>

<p><span class="parno">10-11</span>(2) –(3) "And why should the fire of hatred … the fire of delusion be abandoned and avoided and not be cultivated?

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>(4) "And what is the fire of those worthy of gifts? One's mother and father are called the fire of those worthy of gifts. For what reason?

Those ascetics and brahmins who refrain from intoxication and heedlessness, who are settled in patience and mildness, who tame themselves, calm themselves, and train themselves for nibbāna are called the fire of those worthy of offerings. Therefore, this fire of those worthy of offerings should be properly and happily maintained, having honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated it.</p>
