<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta and the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna were wandering on tour in Dakkhiṇāgiri together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Now on that occasion the female lay follower Veḷukaṇṭakī Nandamātā,<span class="note" id="n1520"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1520] At <a href="../an/an2.133.html">AN2.133</a> and <a href="../an/an4.177.html">AN4.177</a> §4 she is held up as a model for the Buddha’s female lay followers. She is probably identical with Uttarā Nandamātā, declared at <a href="../an/an1.258-267.html">AN1.262</a> to be the foremost of meditators among female lay followers.</span></span></span> having risen as the night was receding, chanted the Pārāyana.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Now on that occasion the great <span class="add">deva</span> king Vessavaṇa was traveling from north to south on some business. He heard the female lay follower Nandamātā chanting the Pārāyana and stood waiting until the end of her recitation.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>When the female lay follower Nandamātā had finished, she fell silent. Having understood that the female lay follower Nandamātā had finished her recitation, the great <span class="add">deva</span> king Vessavaṇa applauded: "Good, sister! Good, sister!"</p>

<p>"Who is that, my dear?"</p>

<p>"I am your brother, the great <span class="add">deva</span> king Vessavaṇa, sister."</p>

<p>"Good, my dear! Then let the Dhamma exposition that I just recited be my guest's gift to you."<span class="note" id="n1521"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1521] <i>Ātitheyya</i>: the traditional gift given to a guest as a token of hospitality.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Good, sister! And let this too <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.64"></a> be your guest's gift to me: Tomorrow, before they have eaten breakfast, the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna will come to Veḷukaṇṭaka. You should serve them and dedicate the offering to me. That will be your guest's gift to me."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then when the night had passed the female lay follower Nandamātā had various kinds of delicious food prepared in her own residence. Then, before they had eaten breakfast, the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna arrived in Veḷukaṇṭaka.</p>

<p>Then the female lay follower Nandamātā addressed a man: "Come, good man. Go to the monastery and announce the time to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus, saying: ‘It is time, Bhante, the meal is ready at Lady Nandamātā's residence.’" The man replied: "Yes, madam," and he went to the monastery and delivered his message. Then the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna dressed, took their bowls and robes, and went to the residence of the female lay follower Nandamātā, where they sat down in the seats that had been prepared.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then, with her own hands, the female lay follower Nandamātā served and satisfied with various kinds of delicious food the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by Sāriputta and Moggallāna. When the Venerable Sāriputta had finished eating and had put away his bowl, she sat down to one side and the Venerable Sāriputta asked her:</p>

<p>"But who, Nandamātā, told you that the Saṅgha of bhikkhus would be approaching?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>(1) "Here, Bhante, having risen as the night was receding, I chanted the Pārāyana …. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.65"></a> <span class="add">She here relates, in the first person, the entire incident narrated above, ending with Vessavaṇa's words: "And this will be your guest's gift tome."</span> … Bhante, let whatever merit I may have gained by this act of giving be dedicated to the happiness of the great <span class="add">deva</span> king Vessavaṇa."</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"It's astounding and amazing,<span class="note" id="n1522"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1522] A comment is called for about the expression <i>acchariyaṁ abbhutaṁ</i>. Though often rendered "wonderful and marvelous," the phrase is not always intended to express appreciation but to suggest, rather, astonishment and amazement. Of course, the boundary line between the two senses is porous, as can be seen from the way the English words "wonderful" and "marvelous," which now have an appreciative sense, evolved from words connected with astonishment.</span></span></span> Nandamātā, that you can converse<span class="note" id="n1523"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1523] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Be</a> and Ee read <i>sallapissasī ti</i>.

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>(2) "Bhante, that is not the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is another. I had only one son, a dear and beloved boy named Nanda. The rulers seized and abducted him on some pretext and executed him. Bhante, when that boy was arrested or was being put under arrest, when he was in prison or was being imprisoned,<span class="note" id="n1524"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1524] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Be</a> and Ee read <i>vadhe vā vajjhamāne vā</i>, Ce <i>baddhe vā vajjhamāne vā</i>. The Sinhala translation in Ce mirrors the inconsistency of its Pāli text. I suggest reading, contrary to all three editions, <i>baddhe vā bajjhamāne vā</i>. In this way the three pairs of phrases represent a sequence of arrest, imprisonment, and execution.</span></span></span> when he was dead or was being killed, I don’t recall any alteration of my mind."<span class="note" id="n1525"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1525] <i>Cittassa aññathattaṁ</i>. The expression recurs just below. My rendering is intended to fit both cases. In the present case a spiritually undeveloped woman would normally be distraught, in the case below she would be frightened.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā, that you can purify even the arising of a thought."<span class="note" id="n1526"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1526] <i>Yatra hi nāma cittuppādampi parisodhessasi</i>.

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>(3) "Bhante, that is not <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.66"></a> the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is still another.

<p>"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā, that you can purify even the arising of a thought."</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>(4) "Bhante, that is not the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is still another. I was given to my young husband in marriage when I was a young girl, but I don’t recall ever transgressing against him even in thought, much less by deed."</p>

<p>"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā, that you can purify even the arising of a thought."</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>(5) "Bhante, that is not the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is still another. Since I declared myself a lay follower, I don’t recall ever intentionally transgressing any training rule."</p>

<p>"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā!"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>(6) "Bhante, that is not the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is still another. For as much as I want, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I enter and dwell in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, I enter and dwell in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. With the fading away as well of rapture, I dwell equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, I experience pleasure <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.67"></a> with the body; I enter and dwell in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, I enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity."</p>

<p>"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā!"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>(7) "Bhante, that is not the only astounding and amazing quality of mine. There is still another. Of the five lower fetters taught by the Blessed One, I don’t see any that I haven’t abandoned."<span class="note" id="n1528"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1528] This establishes her status as a non-returner, who has abandoned the five lower fetters but not the five higher fetters.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"It's astounding and amazing, Nandamātā!"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>Then the Venerable Sāriputta instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Nandamātā with a Dhamma talk, after which he rose from his seat and departed.</p>
