<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>"Bhikkhus, I will teach you seven destinations of persons and attainment of nibbāna through non-clinging. Listen and attend closely. I will speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, are the seven destinations of persons?<span class="note" id="n1531"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1531] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses <i>purisagatiyo</i> with <i>purisassa ñāṇagatiyo</i>, "a person's movement of knowledge." However, the sutta appears to be concerned principally with their destination <i>(gati)</i> after death. The Chinese parallel, MĀ 6 (T I 427a<small>13</small>-c<small>24</small>), renders the title of its Indian original (corresponding to <i>satta purisagatiyo)</i> as <img alt="" src="images/000086.jpg" class="calibre111"/>,  meaning "seven places where good persons are reborn."</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>(1) "Here, a bhikkhu is practicing thus: ‘It might not be, and it might not be mine. It will not be; it will not be mine.<span class="note" id="n1532"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1532] <i>No c’assa no ca me siyā, na bhavissati na me bhavissati.</i> This cryptic formula occurs in the Nikāyas in two versions. One is ascribed to the annihilationists; the other is the Buddha’s adaptation of it. The annihilationist version reads: <i>no c’ assaṃ no ca me siyā, na bhavissāmi na me bhavissati,</i> “I may not be, and it might not be mine. I will not be, and it will not be mine.” Since the two differ only with respect to two verbs<i>—no c’assam</i> vs. <i>no c’assa,</i> and <i>na bhavissāmi</i> vs. <i>na bhavissati</i>—the various recensions sometimes confuse them. From the commentarial glosses, it appears that the confusion had already set in before the age of the commentaries. Readings also differ among different editions of the same text. Generally I prefer the readings in <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce.</a>

<br class="half">This formula is explicitly identified as an annihilationist view <i>(ucchedadiṭṭhi)</i> at <a href="../snsn22.81.html">SN&nbsp;22:81</a>, III 99,4–6. In AN, at <a href="an10.29.html">10:29</a> §8, V 63,28–64,2, it is said to be the foremost of outside speculative views <i>(etadaggaṃ bāhirakānaṃ diṭṭhigatānaṃ).</i> The Buddha transformed this formula into a theme for contemplation conformable to his own teaching by replacing the first-person verbs with their third-person counterparts. This change shifts the stress from the view of self implicit in the annihilationist version (“I will be annihilated”) to an impersonal perspective that harmonizes with the anattā doctrine. In some texts, for example at <a href="../sn/sn22.55.html">SN&nbsp;22:55</a>, III 55–58, practicing on the basis of the formula is said to culminate in the destruction of the five lower fetters, that is, in the stage of a non-returner. Sometimes, as in the present sutta, the formula includes a trailer (see below), contemplation of which is said to lead to equanimity. Practice guided by the full formula leads to one of the five levels of non-returner or to arahantship.

<br class="half">In the Nikāyas the precise meaning of the formula is never made explicit, which suggests that it may have served as an open guide to contemplation to be filled in by the meditator through personal intuition. The commentaries, including Mp, take the truncated particle <i>c’</i> to represent <i>ce,</i> “if,” and interpret the two parts of the formula as conditionals. I translate here from Mp (in conformity with its own interpretation): “If it had not been: If, in the past, there had been no kamma producing individual existence; it would not be mine: now I would have no individual existence. There will not be: Now there will be no kamma producing a future individual existence for me; there will not be mine: in the future there will be no individual existence for me.”

<br class="half">I dissent from the commentaries on the meaning of <i>c’,</i> which I take to represent <i>ca</i> = “and.” The syntax of the phrase as a whole requires this. Skt parallels actually contain <i>ca</i> (for instance, Udānavarga 15:4, parallel to <a href="../ud/ud7.8.html#p4">Ud&nbsp;7.8</a>,¶4, has: <i>no ca syān no ca me syā[n];</i> and <a href="an0-abbr.html">MĀ</a> 6 contains the character <img alt="" src="images/000090.jpg" class="calibre112"/> = “and”) in the appropriate places of the formula. As I interpret the meaning, the first “it” refers to the personal five aggregates, the second to the world apprehended through the aggregates. For the worldling this dyad is misconstrued as a duality of self and world; for the noble disciple it is simply the duality of internal and external phenomena. On this basis I would interpret the formula thus: “The five aggregates can be terminated, and the world presented by them can be terminated. I will so strive that the five aggregates will be terminated, (and thus) the world presented by them will be terminated.”

<br class="half">The trailer reads in Pāli: <i>yadatthi yaṁ bhūtaṁ taṁ pajahāmī ti upekkhaṁ paṭilabhati</i>. Following <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp,</a> I understand "what exists, what has come to be" <i>(yadatthi yaṁ bhūtaṁ)</i> as the presently existing five aggregates. These have come to be through the craving of previous lives and are being abandoned by the abandonment of the cause for their re-arising in a future life, namely, craving or desire-and-lust.</span></span></span> I am abandoning what exists, what has come to be.’ He obtains equanimity. He is not attached to existence; he is not attached to origination. He sees with correct wisdom: ‘There is a higher state that is peaceful,’<span class="note" id="n1533"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1533] <i>Atth’uttariṁ padaṁ santaṁ sammappaññāya passati</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "He sees with path wisdom together with insight, ‘There is a higher peaceful state, nibbāna.’"</span></span></span> yet he has not totally realized that state. He has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to conceit; he has not totally abandoned the underlying tendency to lust for existence; he has not totally abandoned ignorance.<span class="note" id="n1534"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1534] It is the continued presence of these three defilements that distinguishes the non-returner from the arahant, who has eliminated them.</span></span></span> With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.<span class="note" id="n1535"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1535] In accordance with the usual Theravāda commentarial position, <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> explains the <i>antarāparinibbāyī</i> as one who attains nibbāna—the complete extinction of defilements—from the time immediately following rebirth up to the middle of the life span. This position seems contradicted by the similes to follow.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>"For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off and be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus … <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.71"></a> … he has not totally abandoned ignorance. With the utter destruction of the five lower fetters he becomes an attainer of nibbāna in the interval.<span class="note" id="n1536"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1536] The similes illustrate three types of <i>antarāparinibbāyī</i>, "attainers of nibbāna in the interval." Although arguments based on similes are not always reliable, the three similes suggest that the "attainer of nibbāna in the interval" attains nibbāna before actually taking rebirth. Just as the three chips are extinguished after flying off from the red-hot bowl but before hitting the ground, so (on my interpretation) these three types attain final nibbāna respectively either right after entering the intermediate state, or during this state, or shortly before rebirth would take place. In this case, they immediately enter the nibbāna element without residue <i>(anupādisesanibbānadhātu)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

However, the word <i>upahacca</i>, "having struck, having hit," and the simile of the chip that goes out on hitting the ground, suggest that this type is one who attains nibbāna almost immediately after rebirth.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might be produced and fly up, and upon landing on the ground it would be extinguished.

<p>"For example, when an iron bowl has been heated all day and is struck, a chip might fly off, rise up, and fall on a small pile of straw or sticks. There it would produce a fire and smoke, but when it has exhausted that small pile of straw or sticks, if it gets no more fuel, it would be extinguished. So too, a bhikkhu is practicing thus ….

Thus if, as <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> alleges, the <i>upahaccaparinibbāyī</i> were one who attains nibbāna between the midpoint of the life span and its end, there would be no scope for the other two types, those who attain nibbāna without exertion and those who attain nibbāna through exertion.</span></span></span> <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.73"></a></p>

There it would produce a fire and smoke, and when it has exhausted that large <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.74"></a> pile of straw or sticks, it would burn up a woods or a grove until it reaches the edge of a field, the edge of a road, the edge of a stone mountain, the edge of water, or some delightful piece of land, and then, if it gets no more fuel, it would be extinguished.
