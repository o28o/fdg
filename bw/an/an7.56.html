<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then, when the night had advanced, two deities of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Vulture <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.75"></a> Peak, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and stood to one side. One deity then said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, these bhikkhunīs are liberated."</p>

<p>The other said: "Bhante, these bhikkhunīs are well liberated without residue remaining."<span class="note" id="n1540"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1540] <i>Anupādisesā suvimuttā</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> says that this refers to the five hundred bhikkhunīs of Mahāpajāpatī's retinue, who have been liberated without leaving any residue of clinging <i>(upādānasesaṁ aṭṭhapetvā)</i>. The discussion to follow in the sutta makes it clear that <i>anupādisesa</i> here means that they have eliminated all defilements without residue, not that they have attained the nibbāna element without residue <i>(anupādisesanibbānadhātu)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>This is what those deities said. The Teacher agreed. Then, <span class="add">thinking</span>: "The Teacher has agreed," they paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and disappeared right there.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "Last night, bhikkhus, when the night had advanced, two deities of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Vulture Peak, approached me, paid homage to me, and stood to one side. One deity then said to me: ‘Bhante, these bhikkhunīs are liberated.’ And the other said: ‘Bhante, these bhikkhunīs are well liberated without residue remaining.’ This is what those deities said, after which they paid homage to me, circumambulated me keeping the right side toward me, and disappeared right there."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Now on that occasion the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was sitting not far from the Blessed One. Then it occurred to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna: "Which devas know one who has a residue remaining as ‘one with a residue remaining’ and one who has no residue remaining as ‘one without residue remaining’?"</p>

<p>Now at that time a bhikkhu named Tissa had recently died and been reborn in a certain brahmā world. There too they knew him as "the brahmā Tissa, powerful and mighty."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from Mount Vulture Peak and reappeared in that brahmā world. Having seen the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna coming in the distance, the brahmā Tissa <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.76"></a> said to him:</p>

<p>"Come, respected Moggallāna! Welcome, respected Moggallāna! It has been long since you took the opportunity to come here. Sit down, respected Moggallāna. This seat has been prepared." The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna sat down on the prepared seat. The brahmā Tissa then paid homage to the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and sat down to one side. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna then said to him:</p>

<p>"Which devas, Tissa, know one who has a residue remaining as ‘one with a residue remaining’ and one who has no residue remaining as ‘one without residue remaining’?"</p>

<p>"The devas of Brahmā's company have such knowledge, respected Moggallāna."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Do all the devas of Brahmā's company have such knowledge, Tissa?"</p>

<p>"Not all, respected Moggallāna. Those devas of Brahmā's company who are content with a brahmā's life span, a brahmā's beauty, a brahmā's happiness, a brahmā's glory, a brahmā's authority, and who do not understand as it really is an escape higher than this, do not have such knowledge.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"But those devas of Brahmā's company who are not content with a brahmā's life span, a brahmā's beauty, a brahmā's happiness, a brahmā's glory, a brahmā's authority, and who <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.77"></a> understand as it really is an escape higher than this, know one who has a residue remaining as ‘one with a residue remaining’ and one who has no residue remaining as ‘one without residue remaining.’<span class="note" id="n1541"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1541] Of the seven types mentioned in §§1–7, the first two, being arahants, have no residue of defilements; the other five, being trainees, have a residue of defilements.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>(1) "Here, respected Moggallāna, when a bhikkhu is liberated in both respects, those devas know him thus: ‘This venerable one is liberated in both respects. As long as his body stands devas and humans will see him, but with the breakup of the body, devas and humans will see him no more.’ It is in this way that those devas know one who has a residue remaining as ‘one with a residue remaining’ and one who has no residue remaining as ‘one without residue remaining.’</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>(2) "Then, when a bhikkhu is liberated by wisdom, those devas know him thus: ‘This venerable one is liberated by wisdom. As long as his body stands devas and humans will see him, but with the breakup of the body devas and humans will see him no more.’ It is in this way, too, that those devas know one who has a residue remaining ….</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>(3) "Then, when a bhikkhu is a body witness, those devas know him thus: ‘This venerable one is a body witness. If this venerable one resorts to congenial lodgings, relies on good friends, and harmonizes the spiritual faculties, perhaps he will realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, dwell in it.’ It is in this way, too, that those devas know one who has a residue remaining ….</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>(4) "Then, when a bhikkhu is one attained to view … (5) one liberated by faith … (6) a Dhamma follower, those devas know him thus: ‘This venerable one <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.78"></a> is a Dhamma follower. If this venerable one resorts to congenial lodgings, relies on good friends, and harmonizes the spiritual faculties, perhaps he will realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, dwell in it.’ It is in this way, too, that those devas know one who has a residue remaining as ‘one with a residue remaining’ and one who has no residue remaining as ‘one without residue remaining.’</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the words of the brahmā Tissa, just as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna disappeared from the brahmā world and reappeared on Vulture Peak. He approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and reported to the Blessed One his entire conversation with the brahmā Tissa.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span><span class="add">The Blessed One said:</span> "But, Moggallāna, didn’t the brahmā Tissa teach you about the seventh person, the one who dwells in the markless?"<span class="note" id="n1542"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1542] In the normal sevenfold classification of noble persons, the seventh person is the faith follower <i>(saddhānusārī)</i>. Here, however, the seventh place is taken by the <i>animittavihārī</i>, "one who dwells in the markless." <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> says that the Buddha is actually describing the faith follower as one who practices strong insight <i>(balavavipassakavasena)</i>. It explains that "all marks" are all marks of permanence and so forth, and the markless mental concentration <i>(animittaṁ cetosamādhiṁ)</i> as the concentration of strong insight <i>(balavavipassanāsamādhiṁ)</i>. Possibly Mp is attempting to rationalize a textual discrepancy, which might be indicative of a different understanding of the seventh noble person.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"It is the time for this, Blessed One! It is the time for this, Fortunate One! The Blessed One should teach about the seventh person, the one who dwells in the markless. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will retain it in mind."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Then listen, Moggallāna, and attend closely. I will speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>(7) "Here, Moggallāna, through non-attention to all marks, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the markless mental concentration. Those devas know him thus: ‘Through non-attention to all marks, this venerable one enters and dwells in the markless mental concentration. If this venerable one resorts to congenial lodgings, relies on good friends, and harmonizes the spiritual faculties, perhaps he will realize for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.79"></a> and having entered upon it, dwell in it.’ It is in this way, too, that those devas know one who has a residue remaining as ‘one with a residue remaining’ and one who has no residue remaining as ‘one without residue remaining.’"</p>
