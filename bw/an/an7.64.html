<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>"Bhikkhus, there are these seven things that are gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that come upon an angry man or woman. What seven?</p>

<p>(1) "Here, bhikkhus, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘May he be ugly!’ For what reason? An enemy does not delight in the beauty of an enemy. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, though he may be well bathed, well anointed, with trimmed hair and beard, dressed in white clothes, still, he is ugly. This is the first thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>(2) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘May he sleep badly!’ For what reason? An enemy does not delight when an enemy sleeps well. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, though he may sleep on a couch spread with rugs, blankets, and covers, with an excellent covering of antelope hide, with a canopy and red bolsters at both ends, still, he sleeps badly. This is the second thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>(3) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘May he not succeed!’ For what reason? An enemy does not delight in the success of an enemy. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.95"></a> When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, if he gets what is harmful, he thinks: ‘I have gotten what is beneficial,’ and if he gets what is beneficial, he thinks: ‘I have gotten what is harmful.’ When, overcome by anger, he gets these things that are diametrically opposed, they lead to his harm and suffering for a long time. This is the third thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>(4) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘May he not be wealthy!’ For what reason? An enemy does not delight in the wealth of an enemy. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, kings appropriate for the royal treasury any wealth he has acquired by energetic striving, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained. This is the fourth thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>(5) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘May he not be famous!’ For what reason? An enemy does not delight in the fame of an enemy. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, he loses whatever fame he had acquired through heedfulness. This is the fifth thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>(6) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘May he have no friends!’ For what reason? An enemy does not delight in an enemy having friends. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, his friends and companions, relatives and family members, avoid him from afar. This is the sixth thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.96"></a></p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>(7) "Again, an enemy wishes for an enemy: ‘With the breakup of the body, after death, may he be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell!’ For what reason? An enemy does not delight in an enemy's going to a good destination. When an angry person is overcome and oppressed by anger, he engages in misconduct by body, speech, and mind. As a consequence, still overcome by anger, with the breakup of the body, after death, he is reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell. This is the seventh thing gratifying and advantageous to an enemy that comes upon an angry man or woman.</p>

So all three editions, but an older Sri Lankan edition has <i>adhigacchati</i> and a Siamese edition <i>paṭipajjati</i>. All three will work, but with different nuances. The line obviously represents the second danger of anger in the prose portion. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> says "having obtained something profitable, he thinks ‘I have gotten what is harmful’" <i>(vuddhiṁ gahetvā</i> … <i>anattho me gahito ti sallakkheti)</i>. The Chinese counterpart at 618a<small>12</small> has <img alt="" src="images/000020.jpg" class="calibre113"/>, "when he should have obtained great wealth, on the contrary he gets what is harmful."</span></span></span></p>

<p class="verse" id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>The angry person doesn’t know the good;
<br>the angry person doesn’t see the Dhamma.

<p class="verse" id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>When an angry person causes damage,
<br>whether easily or with difficulty,
<br>later, when the anger has vanished,
<br>he is tormented as if burnt by fire.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>He shows recalcitrance
<br>as a fire does a smoky crest.
<br>When his anger spreads outward,
<br>people become angry on his account.<span class="note" id="n1563"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1563] The verse presents several difficulties. Pāda a reads <i>dummaṅkuyaṁ padasseti</i>. Hardy, in his Preface to AN Vol. V (pp. v –vi), states that "<i>dummaṅku</i> signifies one who is staggering in a disagreeable, censurable, and scandalous manner, because he is not ashamed at his behavior, or the like." <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses the word with <i>dubbaṇṇamukhataṁ</i>, "an ugly facial expression," which the Chinese (at 618a<small>21</small>) approximates with <img alt="" src="images/000042.jpg" class="calibre56"/>. The verb in pāda c, <i>patāyati</i>, is unclear. Mp glosses with <i>nibbattati</i>, "is produced," which is not sufficiently precise. PED offers "to be spread out" (perhaps from *<i>sphātayati</i>; see SED sv <i>sphaṭ)</i>, which I adopt. The Chinese <img alt="" src="images/000061.jpg" class="calibre114"/>, "from this is produced hostile envy," may be based on a different word in its Indic original, perhaps <i>spṛhayati</i> (see SED sv <i>spṛh)</i>, which could have arisen from a corruption of something related to *<i>sphātayati</i>.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="verse" id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>He has no shame or fear of wrong,
