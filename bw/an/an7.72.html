<p><span class="parno">1</span>So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants.</p>

<p>While walking along the road, at a certain spot he saw a bonfire burning, blazing, and glowing. Seeing this he left the road, sat at the root of a tree on a seat spread out, and addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants, do you see that bonfire burning, blazing, and glowing?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>“What do you think, mendicants? Which is better — to sit or lie down embracing that bonfire? Or to sit or lie down embracing a girl of the aristocrats or brahmins or householders with soft and tender hands and feet?”</p>

<p>“Sir, it would be much better to sit or lie down embracing a girl of the aristocrats or brahmins or householders with soft and tender hands and feet. For it would be painful to sit or lie down embracing that bonfire.”</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>“I declare this to you, mendicants, I announce this to you! It would be better for that unethical man — of bad qualities, filthy, with suspicious behavior, underhand, no true ascetic or spiritual practitioner, though claiming to be one, rotten inside, corrupt, and depraved — to sit or lie down embracing that bonfire. Why is that? Because that might result in death or deadly pain. But when his body breaks up, after death, it would not cause him to be reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>But when such an unethical man sits or lies down embracing a girl of the aristocrats or brahmins or householders with soft and tender hands and feet, that brings him lasting harm and suffering. When his body breaks up, after death, he’s reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>What do you think, mendicants? Which is better — to have a strong man twist a tough horse-hair rope around both shins and tighten it so that it cuts through your outer skin, your inner skin, your flesh, sinews, and bones, until it reaches your marrow and stays pressing there? Or to consent to well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders bowing down to you?”</p>

<p>“Sir, it would be much better to consent to well-to-do aristocrats or brahmins or householders bowing down.

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>So you should train like this: ‘Our use of robes, alms-food, lodgings, and medicines and supplies for the sick shall be of great fruit and benefit for those who offered them. And our going forth will not be wasted, but will be fruitful and fertile.’ That’s how you should train. Considering your own good, mendicants, is quite enough for you to persist with diligence. Considering the good of others is quite enough for you to persist with diligence. Considering the good of both is quite enough for you to persist with diligence.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>That is what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken, sixty monks spewed hot blood from their mouths. Sixty mendicants rejected the training and returned to a lesser life, saying: </p>

<p>“It’s too hard, Blessed One! It’s just too hard!” And sixty monks were freed from defilements by not grasping.</p>
