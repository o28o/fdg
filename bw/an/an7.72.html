<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was walking on tour among the Kosalans together with a large Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Then, while traveling along the highway, in a certain spot the Blessed One saw a great mass of fire burning, blazing, and glowing. He left the highway, sat down on the seat prepared for him at the foot of a tree, and addressed the bhikkhus: "Bhikkhus, do you see that great mass of fire burning, blazing, and glowing?"</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>(1) "What do you think, bhikkhus? Which is better, to embrace that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, and glowing, and sit down or lie down next to it, or to embrace a girl with soft and tender hands and feet—whether from a khattiya, brahmin, or householder clan—and sit down or lie down next to her?"</p>

<p>"It would be far better, Bhante, to embrace a girl with soft and tender hands and feet—whether from a khattiya, brahmin, or householder clan—and sit down or lie down next to her. It would be painful to embrace that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, and glowing, and sit down or lie down next to it."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"I inform you, bhikkhus, I declare to you that for an immoral man of bad character—one of impure and suspect behavior, secretive in his actions, not an ascetic though claiming to be one, not a celibate though claiming to be one, inwardly rotten, corrupt, depraved—it would be far better to embrace that great mass of fire, burning, blazing, and glowing, and sit down or lie down next to it. For what reason? Because on that account <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.129"></a> he might undergo death or deadly pain, but for that reason he would not, with the breakup of the body, after death, be reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell.</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train yourselves thus: ‘When we use robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicines and provisions for the sick, these services that <span class="add">others</span> provide for us will be of great fruit and benefit to them, and this going forth of ours will not be barren, but fruitful and fertile.’ Thus should you train yourselves. Considering your own good, bhikkhus, it is enough to strive for the goal with heedfulness; considering the good of others, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.135"></a> it is enough to strive for the goal with heedfulness; considering the good of both, it is enough to strive for the goal with heedfulness."<span class="note" id="n1597"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1597] See SN <a >12:22</a>, II 29,<small>16–21</small>.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>This is what the Blessed One said. Now while this exposition was being spoken, sixty bhikkhus vomited hot blood. Sixty bhikkhus gave up the training and returned to the lower life, saying: "It is difficult to do, Blessed One, very difficult to do." And the minds of sixty bhikkhus were liberated from the taints by non-clinging.<span class="note" id="n1598"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1598] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp,</a> commenting on <a href="../an/an1.53.html">AN1.53</a>, discusses this passage more fully as follows: "Those bhikkhus who vomited hot blood had committed <i>pārājika</i> offenses. Those who returned to lay life had been going around violating the lesser and minor training rules. And those who attained arahantship had purified their behavior. The Teacher's discourse was fruitful for all three. (Question:) Granted it was fruitful for those who attained arahantship, how was it fruitful for the others? (Reply:) Because if they had not heard this discourse, (the first kind) would have become heedless and would not have been able to abandon their condition. Their evil behavior would have increased and dragged them down to the realms of misery. But when they heard this discourse, they were filled with a sense of urgency. Having abandoned their condition, some became sāmaṇeras (novices), fulfilled the ten precepts, applied themselves to careful attention, and became stream-enterers, once-returners, or non-returners, while some were reborn in the deva world. Thus it was fruitful even for those who had committed <i>pārājikas</i>. If the others had not heard this discourse, as time went on, they would have gradually committed <i>saṅghādisesas</i> and <i>pārājikas</i>. They would have been reborn in the realms of misery and experienced great suffering. But having heard it, thinking that they could not fulfill the practice all their lives, they gave up the training and returned to lay life. They became settled in the three refuges, observed the five precepts, fulfilled the duty of a lay follower, and became stream-enterers, once-returners, or non-returners, while some were reborn in the deva world. Thus the discourse was fruitful for them, too."</span></span></span></p>
