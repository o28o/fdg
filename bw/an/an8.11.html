<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Verañjā at the foot of Naḷeru's neem tree.<span class="note" id="n1637"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1637] <i>Naḷerupucimandamūle</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Sp</a> I 108,<small>29–30</small> says that Naḷeru was the name of a yakkha.</span></span></span> Then a brahmin of Verañjā <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.173"></a> approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When he had concluded his greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"I have heard, Master Gotama: ‘The ascetic Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat.’ This is indeed true, for Master Gotama does not pay homage to brahmins who are old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage; nor does he stand up for them or offer them a seat. This is not proper, Master Gotama."<span class="note" id="n1638"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1638] A similar rebuke against the Buddha is voiced at <a href="../an/an4.22.html">AN4.22</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Brahmin, in the world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, in this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, I do not see one to whom I should pay homage, or for whom I should stand up, or whom I should offer a seat. For if the Tathāgata should pay homage to anyone, or stand up for him, or offer him a seat, even that person's head would split."</p>

Utterly unwilling to accept the Buddha’s statement, he spoke thus, referring to the ‘taste of concord’ <i>(sāmaggirasa)</i>, which in the world means paying homage, standing respectfully, reverential salutation, and polite conduct. To soften his mind, the Blessed One avoids directly contradicting him; instead he states that the term applies to him, but intending this in a different sense. (The Buddha speaks of ‘taste’) as the gratification in sensual pleasure that arises in worldlings—even in those considered the best by way of class or rebirth—who relish, welcome, and lust after objects such as forms, etc."</span></span></span></p>

<p>"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama lacks taste.’ The Tathāgata has abandoned his taste for forms, sounds, odours, tastes, and tactile objects; he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama lacks taste.’ But you did not speak with reference to this." <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.174"></a></p>

<p>"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is not convivial.’ The Tathāgata has abandoned conviviality with forms, sounds, odours, tastes, and tactile objects; he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising.

<p>"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing.’ For I assert the non-doing of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; I assert the non-doing of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome deeds.

<p>"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist.’ For I assert the annihilation of lust, hatred, and delusion; I assert the annihilation of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities.

But the Blessed One acknowledges this in a metaphorical sense. He is repelled by bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct and by the various bad unwholesome qualities, just as a man fond of ornaments would be repelled and disgusted by feces."</span></span></span></p>

<p>"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a repeller.’ For I am repelled by bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; I am repelled by the acquisition of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.175"></a> qualities.

Venayika</i>, from the verb <i>vineti</i> (to discipline, to remove), can mean "one who imposes discipline, one who trains others." But in the Buddha’s time the word <i>venayika</i> also seems to have acquired the meaning of "one who leads astray," who leads others to destruction. Thus <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses <i>vineti</i>, in the brahmin's view, with <i>vināseti</i>, "destroys." But the Buddha affirms this in the sense that he teaches the Dhamma for the removal of lust and other defilements <i>(rāgādīnaṁ vinayāya)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is an abolitionist.’ For I teach the Dhamma for the abolition of lust, hatred, and delusion; I teach the Dhamma for the abolition of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities.

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>(7) "Master Gotama is a tormentor."<span class="note" id="n1645"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1645] <i>Tapassī bhavaṁ Gotamo</i>. A <i>tapassī</i> is usually an ascetic devoted to self-torment. The word is derived from the verb <i>tapati</i>, "to burn up, to heat up." The brahmin, according to <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp,</a> uses the word in the sense of one who torments elders by not showing proper respect to them. But the Buddha uses the term to mean that he burns up unwholesome qualities.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a tormentor.’ For I assert that bad unwholesome qualities—bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct—are to be burned up. I say that someone is a tormentor when he has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up; when he has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. The Tathāgata has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up; he has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising.

The Buddha plays on the word as if it meant "rid of <i>(apa)</i> the womb <i>(gabbha)</i>." It is nearly impossible to capture this pun in translation; my use of "retiring" is a clumsy attempt to bridge the two senses: "timid" and "retired" from wandering through the round of rebirths.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"There is, brahmin, a way in which one could rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is retiring.’ For I say that someone is retiring when he has abandoned the production of renewed existence, the future bed of the womb; when he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.176"></a> so that it is no more subject to future arising. The Tathāgata has abandoned the production of renewed existence, the future bed of the womb; he has cut it off at the root, made it like a palm stump, obliterated it so that it is no more subject to future arising.

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Suppose, brahmin, there was a hen with eight, ten, or twelve eggs that she had properly covered, incubated, and nurtured. Should the first among those chicks to pierce its shell with the points of its claws or beak and safely hatch be called the eldest or the youngest?"</p>

<p>"It should be called the eldest, Master Gotama. So it is the eldest among them."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"So too, brahmin, in a population immersed in ignorance, become like an egg, completely enveloped,<span class="note" id="n1647"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1647] See <a href="../an/an4.128.html">AN4.128</a> §4.</span></span></span> I have pierced the eggshell of ignorance. I am the sole person in the world who has awakened to the unsurpassed perfect enlightenment. So I am the eldest, the best in the world.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"My energy, brahmin, was aroused without slackening; my mindfulness was established without confusion; my body was tranquil without disturbance; my mind was concentrated and one-pointed. Secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna, which consists of rapture and pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by thought and examination. With the subsiding of thought and examination, I entered and dwelled in the second jhāna, which has internal placidity and unification of mind and consists of rapture and pleasure born of concentration, without thought and examination. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.177"></a> With the fading away as well of rapture, I dwelled equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, I experienced pleasure with the body; I entered and dwelled in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: <i>‘</i>He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and dejection, I entered and dwelled in the fourth jhāna, neither painful nor pleasant, which has purification of mindfulness by equanimity.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the recollection of past abodes.<span class="note" id="n1648"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1648] Following <a href="an0-abbr.html">Be</a> and Ee, I give the first two knowledges in full. Ce abridges them.</span></span></span> I recollected my manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many eons of world-dissolution, many eons of world-evolution, many eons of world-dissolution and world-evolution thus: ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here.’ Thus I recollected my manifold past abodes with their aspects and details.</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"This, brahmin, was the first true knowledge attained by me in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was dispelled, true knowledge had arisen; darkness was dispelled, light had arisen, as happens when one dwells heedful, ardent, and resolute. This, brahmin, was my first breaking out, like that of the chick breaking out of the eggshell. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.178"></a></p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away and rebirth of beings. With the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings fare in accordance with their kamma thus: ‘These beings who engaged in misconduct by body, speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook kamma based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in the plane of misery, in a bad destination, in the lower world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct by body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook kamma based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings fare in accordance with their kamma.</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"This, brahmin, was the second true knowledge attained by me in the middle watch of the night.

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"When my mind was thus concentrated, purified, cleansed, unblemished, rid of defilement, malleable, wieldy, steady, and attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the destruction of the taints.

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>When this was said, the brahmin of Verañjā said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama is the eldest! Master Gotama is the best! Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."</p>
