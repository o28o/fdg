<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Now on that occasion, a number of well-known Licchavis had assembled in the meeting hall and were sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.180"></a></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>On that occasion Sīha the general, a disciple of the Nigaṇṭhas, was sitting in that assembly. It then occurred to him: "Doubtlessly, he must be a Blessed One, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One. For a number of these well-known Licchavis have assembled in the meeting hall and are sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. Let me go see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One."</p>

<p>Then Sīha went to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and said to him: "Bhante, I wish to go see the ascetic Gotama."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Since you are a proponent of deeds, Sīha, why go see the ascetic Gotama, a proponent of non-doing? For the ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples."<span class="note" id="n1650"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1650] It is strange that Mahāvīra (the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta) is depicted as making such a statement. The Jains certainly must have known that the Buddha also taught a doctrine of kamma, though different from their own. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> says that Nātaputta was extremely displeased at Sīha's request and thought to prevent him from going. His words "destroyed the joy that had arisen in Sīha, as if striking a stray bull with a stick, extinguishing a burning lamp, or turning over a bowl of food."</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then Sīha's determination to go see the Blessed One subsided.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">4-5</span>On a second occasion, a number of well-known Licchavis had assembled in the meeting hall and were sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha …. <span class="add">All as above, except this is now said to occur "on a second occasion."</span> <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.181"></a> … On a second occasion, Sīha's determination to go see the Blessed One subsided.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>On a third occasion, a number of well-known Licchavis had assembled in the meeting hall and were sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. It then occurred to Sīha: "Doubtlessly, he must be a Blessed One, an Arahant, a Perfectly Enlightened One. For a number of these well-known Licchavis have assembled in the meeting hall and are sitting together speaking in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. What can the Nigaṇṭhas do to me whether or not I obtain their permission? Without having obtained the permission of the Nigaṇṭhas, let me go see that Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One."<span class="note" id="n1651"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1651] I read with <a href="an0-abbr.html">Be</a> and Ee: <i>yannūnāhaṁ anapaloketvā va nigaṇṭhe</i>, as against Ce <i>yannūnāhaṁ anapalokitā va nigaṇṭhe</i>. In the previous sentence, with <i>nigaṇṭhā</i> as subject, the past participles <i>apalokitā vā anapalokitā vā</i> are appropriate as nominatives in agreement with the subject. In this sentence, where <i>ahaṁ</i> is the subject, an absolutive signifying an act of Sīha is preferable.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then, with five hundred chariots, Sīha the general set out from Vesālī in the middle of the day in order to see the Blessed One. He went by carriage as far as the ground was suitable for a carriage, and then dismounted from his carriage and entered the monastery grounds on foot. He approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"I have heard this, Bhante: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of non-doing <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.182"></a> who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of non-doing and thereby guides his disciples.’ Do those who speak thus state what has been said by the Blessed One and not misrepresent him with what is contrary to fact? Do they explain in accordance with the Dhamma so that they would not incur any reasonable criticism or ground for censure?<span class="note" id="n1652"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1652] See <a href="an3.57.html#n416">AN3.57, n.&nbsp;416</a>.</span></span></span> For we do not want to misrepresent the Blessed One."</p>

For I assert the non-doing of bodily, verbal, and mental misconduct; I assert the non-doing of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome deeds.

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>(2)"And in what way could one rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a proponent of deeds who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of deeds and thereby guides his disciples’?

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>(3)"And in what way could one rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is an annihilationist who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of annihilation and thereby guides his disciples’? For I assert the annihilation of lust, hatred, and delusion; I assert the annihilation of the numerous kinds of bad unwholesome qualities.

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>(4)"And in what way could one rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a repeller who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of repulsion and thereby guides his disciples’?

I say that someone is a tormentor when he has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up; when he has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. The Tathāgata has abandoned the bad unwholesome qualities that are to be burned up; he has cut them off at the root, made them like a palm stump, obliterated them so that they are no more subject to future arising. It is in this way that one could rightly say of me: ‘The ascetic Gotama is a tormentor who teaches his Dhamma for the sake of tormenting and thereby guides his disciples.’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>When this was said, Sīha the general said to the Blessed One: "Excellent, Bhante! Excellent, Bhante! … Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>"Make an investigation, Sīha! It is good for such well-known people like yourself to make an investigation."<span class="note" id="n1656"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1656] What follows here, up to "and become independent of others in the teaching of the Teacher," closely matches Upāli's experience at <a href="../mn/mn56.html#p65">MN&nbsp;56.65–98</a>, I 379,<small>2</small> –380,<small>10</small>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>"Bhante, I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed One for telling me: ‘Make an investigation, Sīha! It is good for such well-known people like yourself to make an investigation.’ For if the members of other sects were to gain me as their disciple, they would carry a banner all over Vesālī announcing: <i>‘</i>Sīha the general has become our disciple.’ But the Blessed One rather tells me: ‘Make an investigation, Sīha! It is good for such well-known people like yourself to make an investigation.’ So for the second time, Bhante, I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."</p>

<p>"Sīha, your family has long been a fountain of support for the Nigaṇṭhas; hence you should consider continuing to give alms to them when they approach you."</p>

<p>"Bhante, I am even more satisfied and pleased with the Blessed One for telling me: ‘Sīha, your family has long been a fountain of support for the Nigaṇṭhas; hence you should consider continuing to give alms to them when they approach you.’ For I have heard: ‘The ascetic Gotama says thus: <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.186"></a> "Alms should be given only to me, not to others; alms should be given only to my disciples, not to the disciples of others. Only what is given to me is very fruitful, not what is given to others; only what is given to my disciples is very fruitful, not what is given to the disciples of others."’<span class="note" id="n1657"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1657] This charge is also addressed at <a href="../an/an3.57.html">AN3.57</a>.</span></span></span> Yet the Blessed One encourages me to give to the Nigaṇṭhas, too. We’ll know the right time for this. So for the third time, Bhante, I go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. Let the Blessed One accept me as a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life."</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>Then the Blessed One gave Sīha the general a progressive discourse, that is, a talk on giving, virtuous behavior, and heaven; he revealed the danger, degradation, and defilement of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. When the Blessed One knew that Sīha's mind was pliant, softened, rid of hindrances, uplifted, and confident, he revealed that Dhamma teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Then, just as a clean cloth rid of dark spots would readily absorb dye, so too, while Sīha the general sat in that same seat, there arose in him the dust-free, stainless Dhamma-eye: ‘Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.’</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>Sīha the general became one who had seen the Dhamma, attained the Dhamma, understood the Dhamma, fathomed the Dhamma, crossed over doubt, gotten rid of bewilderment, attained self-confidence, and become independent of others in the teaching of the Teacher. He then said to the Blessed One:</p>

<p>"Bhante, please let the Blessed One <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.187"></a> together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus accept tomorrow's meal from me."</p>

<hr>
<p>The Blessed One consented by silence. Having understood that the Blessed One had consented, Sīha rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed.</p>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>Then Sīha addressed a man: "Go, good man, find some meat ready for sale."</p>

<p>Then, when the night had passed, Sīha the general had various kinds of excellent foods prepared in his own residence, after which he had the time announced to the Blessed One: "It is time, Bhante, the meal is ready."</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, went to Sīha's residence along with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus, and sat down on the seat prepared for him. Now on that occasion a number of Nigaṇṭhas <span class="add">went</span> from street to street and from square to square in Vesālī, thrashing their arms about and crying out: "Today Sīha the general has slain a plump animal to prepare a meal for the ascetic Gotama!

<hr>
<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>Then a man approached Sīha the general and whispered into his ear: "Sir, you should know that a number of Nigaṇṭhas <span class="add">are going</span> from street to street and from square to square in Vesālī, thrashing their arms about and crying out: ‘Today Sīha the general has slain a plump animal to prepare a meal for the ascetic Gotama!

It is curious, indeed almost disingenuous, that the Buddhist texts depict the Jains as criticizing the Buddha for eating meat from an animal killed especially for him. This charge plays right into the Buddhists’ protest that the Buddha is being slandered and their rejoinder that he would never intentionally have a living being killed for his meal. But as the Jains were strict vegetarians, we can be almost certain that they criticized the Buddha and his disciples, not for having an animal killed for their meal, but simply for consuming meat.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>Then, with his own hands, Sīha the general served and satisfied the Saṅgha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with the various kinds of excellent food. Then, when the Blessed One had finished eating and had put away his bowl, Sīha sat down to one side. Then the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened Sīha with a Dhamma talk, after which he rose from his seat and departed.</p>
