<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Koliyans near the Koliyan town named Kakkarapatta. There the young Koliyan Dīghajāṇu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Bhante, we are laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, living at home in a house full of children. We use sandalwood from Kāsi; we wear garlands, scents, and unguents; we receive gold and silver. Let the Blessed One teach us the Dhamma in a way that will lead to our welfare and happiness in this present life and in future lives."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"There are, Byagghapajja,<span class="note" id="n1750"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1750] Though <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> spells the name "Vyagghapajja," I use this spelling to be consistent with the spelling of the name at <a href="../an/an4.194.html">AN4.194</a>. This must have been his clan name, Dīghajāṇu his personal name.</span></span></span> these four things that lead to the welfare and happiness of a clansman in this present life. What four? Accomplishment in initiative, accomplishment in protection, good friendship, and balanced living.</p>

<p>(1) "And what is accomplishment in initiative? Here, whatever may be the means by which a clansman earns his living—whether by farming, trade, raising cattle, archery, government service, or some other craft—he is skillful and diligent; he possesses sound judgment about it in order to carry out and arrange it properly. This is called accomplishment in initiative.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>(2) "And what is accomplishment in protection? Here, a clansman sets up protection and guard over the wealth he has <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.282"></a> acquired by initiative and energy, amassed by the strength of his arms, earned by the sweat of his brow, righteous wealth righteously gained, thinking: <i>‘</i>How can I prevent kings and thieves from taking it, fire from burning it, floods from sweeping it off, and displeasing heirs from taking it?’ This is called accomplishment in protection.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>(3) "And what is good friendship? Here, in whatever village or town a clansman lives, he associates with householders or their sons—whether young but of mature virtue, or old and of mature virtue—who are accomplished in faith, virtuous behavior, generosity, and wisdom; he converses with them and engages in discussions with them. Insofar as they are accomplished in faith, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in faith; insofar as they are accomplished in virtuous behavior, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in virtuous behavior; insofar as they are accomplished in generosity, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in generosity; insofar as they are accomplished in wisdom, he emulates them with respect to their accomplishment in wisdom. This is called good friendship.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>(4) "And what is balanced living? Here, a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, <span class="add">aware</span>: ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.’ Just as an appraiser or his apprentice, holding up a scale, knows: <i>‘</i>By so much it has dipped down, by so much it has gone up,’ so a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, <span class="add">aware</span>: ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditures <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.283"></a> rather than the reverse.’</p>

<p>"If this clansman has a small income but lives luxuriously, others would say of him: ‘This clansman eats his wealth just like an eater of figs.’<span class="note" id="n1751"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1751] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> and Ee <i>udumbarakhādikaṁ va</i>; Be <i>udumbarakhādīvāyaṁ</i>. The intended meaning is obscure. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> explains: "One wishing to eat figs might shake a ripe fig tree and with one effort knock down many fruits. He would eat the ripe fruits and depart, leaving behind the rest; just so, one who spends the greater part of his earnings enjoys his wealth by dissipating it, so it is said: ‘This clansman eats his wealth just like an eater of figs.’" A Chinese parallel, SĀ 91 (T II 23a<small>22</small> –c<small>17</small>), reads at T II 23b<small>17</small>: <img alt="" src="images/000023.jpg" class="calibre119"/> "Everyone calls him a fig without seeds. The foolish man, a prey to craving, does not consider those who come after."</span></span></span> But if he has a large income but lives sparingly, others would say of him: ‘This clansman may even starve himself.’<span class="note" id="n1752"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1752] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> and Ee <i>ajaddhumārikaṁ</i>; Be <i>ajeṭṭhamaraṇaṁ</i>. DOP relates the compound to Skt <i>jagdhvā</i>, "having eaten," and defines <i>ajaddhumārikā</i> as "death by starvation." See PED sv <i>jaddhu</i>, said to occur only as negative <i>ajaddhu</i>, "not eating, abstaining from food." <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> Ce glosses with <i>anāthamaraṇaṁ</i>, "death without a protector," <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> Be <i>anāyakamaraṇaṁ</i>,"death without a leader."It seems <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> Ce is glossing the reading found in Be. The Chinese at T II 23b<small>19–20</small> has  <img alt="" src="images/000028.jpg" class="calibre120"/>, "Other people will all say that foolish man is like a dog starving to death."</span></span></span> But it is called balanced living when a clansman knows his income and expenditures and leads a balanced life, neither too extravagant nor too frugal, <span class="add">aware</span>: ‘In this way my income will exceed my expenditures rather than the reverse.’</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"The wealth thus amassed has four sources of dissipation: womanizing, drunkenness, gambling, and bad friendship, bad companionship, bad comradeship. Just as if there were a large reservoir with four inlets and four outlets, and a man would close the inlets and open the outlets, and sufficient rain does not fall, one could expect the water in the reservoir to decrease rather than increase; so the wealth thus amassed has four sources of dissipation: womanizing … bad comradeship.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"The wealth thus amassed has four sources of accretion: one avoids womanizing, drunkenness, and <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.284"></a> gambling, and cultivates good friendship, good companionship, good comradeship. Just as if there were a large reservoir with four inlets and four outlets, and a man would open the inlets and close the outlets, and sufficient rain falls; one could expect the water in the reservoir to increase rather than decrease, so the wealth amassed has four sources of accretion: one avoids womanizing … and cultivates good friendship.</p>

Accomplishment in faith, accomplishment in virtuous behavior, accomplishment in generosity, and accomplishment in wisdom.</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>(5) "And what is accomplishment in faith? Here, a clansman is endowed with faith. He places faith in the enlightenment of the Tathāgata thus: <i>‘</i>The Blessed One is an arahant … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ This is called accomplishment in faith.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>(6) "And what is accomplishment in virtuous behavior? Here, a clansman abstains from the destruction of life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from false speech, and from liquor, wine, and intoxicants, the basis for heedlessness. This is called accomplishment in virtuous behavior.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>(7) "And what is accomplishment in generosity? Here, a clansman dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of miserliness, freely generous, openhanded, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity, delighting in giving and sharing. This is called accomplishment in generosity.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>(8) "And what is accomplishment in wisdom? <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.285"></a> Here, a clansman is wise; he possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away, which is noble and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering. This is called accomplishment in wisdom.</p>
