<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Vesālī in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Vesālī for alms. When he had walked for alms in Vesālī, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "Take a sitting cloth, Ānanda. Let us go to the Cāpāla Shrine for the day's dwelling."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied and, having taken a sitting cloth, he followed closely behind the Blessed One.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>The Blessed One then went to the Cāpāla Shrine, sat down on the seat that was prepared for him, and said to the Venerable Ānanda: <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.309"></a></p>

<p id="note1786"><span class="parno">3</span>"Delightful is Vesālī, Ānanda. Delightful is the Udena Shrine, delightful the Gotamaka Shrine, delightful the Sattamba Shrine, delightful the Bahuputta Shrine, delightful the Sārandada Shrine, delightful the Cāpāla Shrine. Whoever, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency, made them a vehicle and basis, carried them out, consolidated them, and properly undertaken them could, if he so wished, live on for an eon or for the remainder of an eon. The Tathāgata, Ānanda, has developed and cultivated the four bases for psychic potency, made them a vehicle and basis, carried them out, consolidated them, and properly undertaken them. If he so wished, the Tathāgata could live on for an eon or for the remainder of an eon."<span class="note" id="n1786"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1786] <i>Kappaṁ vā tiṭṭheyya kappāvasesaṁ vā</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses <i>kappa</i>, "eon," as <i>āyukappa</i>, "the life eon," the full normal life span of human beings at a particular time, presently a hundred years. <i>Kappāvasesa</i>, "the remainder of the eon," is explained as a little more than the normal life span of a hundred years. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> mentions the view of an elder named Mahāsīva, who held that the Buddha could live on for the rest of the cosmic eon, but Mp cites the old commentary as holding that the "life eon" alone is intended <i>(idameva aṭṭhakathāya niyāmitaṁ)</i>. Nevertheless, nowhere else in the Nikāyas is <i>kappa</i> used in the sense of a normal human life span, and there seems no compelling reason to ascribe to the word as used here a meaning different from the usual one, that is, a cosmic eon.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>But though the Venerable Ānanda was given such an obvious signal by the Blessed One, though he was given such an obvious hint, he was unable to pick up the hint. He did not request the Blessed One: "Bhante, let the Blessed One live on for an eon! Let the Fortunate One live on for an eon, for the welfare of many people, for the happiness of many people, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of devas and humans." For his mind was obsessed by Māra.<span class="note" id="n1787"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1787] <i>Yathā taṁ Mārena pariyuṭṭhitacitto</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "As any worldling would not be able to pick up a hint, so Ānanda was unable to pick it up. For Māra can obsess the mind of anyone who has not entirely abandoned the twelve cognitive inversions <i>(vipallāsa</i>; see <a href="../an/an4.49.html">AN4.49</a>), and Ānanda (being only a stream-enterer) still had four of them. (Mp-ṭ: The inversions of perception and thought that take the unattractive as attractive and the painful as pleasurable.) Māra obsessed his mind by displaying a frightful sight. On seeing this, the elder failed to pick up the clear hint given him by the Buddha."</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>A second time … A third time the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "Delightful is Vesālī … Delightful is the Udena Shrine … delightful the Cāpāla Shrine.

<p>But again, though the Venerable Ānanda <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.310"></a> was given such an obvious signal by the Blessed One, though he was given such an obvious hint, he was unable to pick up the hint …. For his mind was obsessed by Māra.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "You may go, Ānanda, at your own convenience..</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied, and he rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and sat down at the foot of a tree not far from the Blessed One.</p>

<p>Then, not long after the Venerable Ānanda had left, Māra the Evil One said to the Blessed One:</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time, Bhante, for the Blessed One's final nibbāna! These words were uttered, Bhante, by the Blessed One:<span class="note" id="n1788"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1788] Interestingly, in the Nikāyas no such conversation between the Buddha and Māra is recorded as having taken place earlier in the Buddha’s life. It is referred to only in this sutta and its parallels at <a href="../dn/dn16.html#266">DN16.266</a>, and <a href="../sn/sn51.10.html">SN51:10</a>.</span></span></span><i>‘</i>I will not attain final nibbāna, Evil One, until there are bhikkhu disciples of mine who are competent, disciplined, self-confident, attained to security from bondage, learned, upholders of the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing in the proper way, conducting themselves accordingly; who have learned their own teacher's teaching and can explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it; who can thoroughly refute in reasoned ways the current tenets of others and teach the antidotal Dhamma.’<span class="note" id="n1789"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1789] The expression <i>pattayogakkhemā,</i> “attained to security from bondage,” is in all three editions of AN but is absent from some (but not all) editions of the text’s parallels in DN and SN mentioned in the preceding note. Since the phrase normally denotes the attainment of arahantship, it seems out of place in a description of the lay disciples. Mp comments on all the other expressions here but this, which suggests it was not present in the version available to the commentator.

<br class="half"><a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses <i>sappāṭihāriyaṁ dhammaṁ desenti</i> with "they teach the Dhamma so that it is emancipating" <i>(yāva niyyānikaṁ katvā dhammaṁ desessanti)</i>. Mp-ṭ elaborates: "They explain the Dhamma in such a way that the doctrines of others are demolished and their own doctrine is established; thus, by citing reasons, it brings attainment of the goal (to be) achieved" <i>(yathā paravādaṁ bhañjitvā sakavādo patiṭṭhahati</i>, <i>evaṁ hetūdāharaṇehi yathādhigatamatthaṁ sampādetvā dhammaṁ kathessanti)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time for the Blessed One's final nibbāna!</p>

<p>"And these words were uttered, Bhante, by the Blessed One: ‘I will not attain final nibbāna, Evil One, until there are bhikkhunī disciples of mine who are competent … until there are male lay disciples of mine <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.311"></a> who are competent … until there are female lay disciples of mine who are competent … and teach the antidotal Dhamma.’ Now at present the Blessed One has bhikkhunī disciples … male lay disciples … female lay disciples who are competent, disciplined, self-confident, attained to security from bondage, learned, upholders of the Dhamma, practicing in accordance with the Dhamma, practicing in the proper way, conducting themselves accordingly; who have learned their own teacher's doctrine and can explain it, teach it, proclaim it, establish it, disclose it, analyze it, and elucidate it; who can thoroughly refute in reasoned ways the current tenets of others and teach the antidotal Dhamma.</p>

<p>"And these words were uttered, Bhante, by the Blessed One: ‘I will not attain final nibbāna, Evil One, until this spiritual life of mine has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, well proclaimed among devas and humans.’ That spiritual life of the Blessed One has become successful and prosperous, extensive, popular, widespread, well proclaimed among devas and humans.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Bhante, let the Blessed One now attain final nibbāna! Let the Fortunate One now attain final nibbāna! Now is the time, Bhante, for the Blessed One's final nibbāna!"</p>

<p><span class="add">The Blessed One said:</span> "Be at ease, Evil One. It won’t be long before the Tathāgata's final nibbāna takes place. Three months from now the Tathāgata will attain final nibbāna."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>Then the Blessed One, at the Cāpāla Shrine, mindful and clearly comprehending, let go his vital force.<span class="note" id="n1790"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1790] <i>Āyusaṅkhāraṁ ossaji</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "Having thoroughly set up mindfulness, having limited it by knowledge, he discarded, abandoned, his vital force.

<hr>
<p>Then, having understood the meaning of this, the Blessed One on that occasion uttered this inspired utterance: <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.312"></a></p>

<p class="verse" id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Comparing the incomparable and continued existence,

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>Then it occurred to the Venerable Ānanda: "This earthquake was indeed powerful! This earthquake was indeed very powerful, frightening and terrifying, and peals of thunder shook the sky! What is the cause and condition for a powerful earthquake?"</p>
