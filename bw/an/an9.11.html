<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Bhante, I have completed the rains residence at Sāvatthī. I want to depart on a tour of the countryside."</p>

<p>"You may go, Sāriputta, at your own convenience."</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Venerable Sāriputta rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, circumambulated him keeping the right side toward him, and departed. <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.374"></a> Then, not long after the Venerable Sāriputta had left, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, the Venerable Sāriputta struck me and then set out on tour without apologizing."<span class="note" id="n1851"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1851] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses <i>āsajja</i> with <i>ghaṭṭetvā</i>, implying physical violence, and <i>appaṭinissajja</i> with <i>akkhamāpetvā</i>, "without asking pardon." <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> continues: "Why did he bear resentment (against Sāriputta)? It is said that after the elder had paid homage to the Buddha, the edge of his robe hit the monk's body as he was walking away …. Because of this the monk became resentful, so when he saw the elder leaving with a large retinue, out of envy he thought to obstruct his journey; thus he spoke as he did."</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: "Go, bhikkhu, in my name call Sāriputta, <span class="add">telling him</span>: ‘The Teacher is calling you, friend Sāriputta.’’’<span class="note" id="n1852"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1852] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> explains that if the Buddha had tried to exonerate Sāriputta, the bhikkhu would have thought that the Teacher was taking the side of his chief disciple and not the side of a junior monk; thus he would have harbored hatred against the Buddha, too. By calling Sāriputta and asking him about the matter, the Buddha will get Sāriputta to exonerate himself.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," that bhikkhu replied. Then he approached the Venerable Sāriputta and said: "The Teacher is calling you, friend Sāriputta.’’</p>

<p>"Yes, friend," the Venerable Sāriputta replied.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Now on that occasion the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and the Venerable Ānanda took a key and wandered from dwelling to dwelling, <span class="add">calling out</span>: "Come forth, venerables! Come forth, venerables! Now the Venerable Sāriputta will roar his lion's roar in the presence of the Blessed One!"</p>

<p>Then the Venerable Sāriputta approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One said to him: "Sāriputta, one of your fellow monks has made a complaint about you, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘Bhante, the Venerable Sāriputta struck me and then set out on tour without apologizing.’"</p>

<p>(9) "Bhante, one who has not established mindfulness directed to the body in regard to his own body might strike a fellow monk and then set out on tour without apologizing.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Then that <span class="add">accusing</span> bhikkhu rose from his seat, arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed One's feet, and said to the Blessed One: "Bhante, I have committed a transgression in that I so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully slandered the Venerable Sāriputta on grounds that are untrue, baseless, and false. Bhante, may the Blessed One accept my transgression seen as a transgression for the sake of future restraint."</p>

<p>"Surely, bhikkhu, you have committed a transgression in that you so foolishly, stupidly, and unskillfully slandered the Venerable Sāriputta on grounds that are untrue, baseless, and false. But since you see your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, we accept it. For it is growth in the Noble One's discipline that one sees one's transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes future restraint." <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.378"></a></p>

<hr>
<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>The Blessed One then addressed the Venerable Sāriputta: "Sāriputta, pardon this hollow man before his head splits into seven pieces right there."</p>

<p>"I will pardon this venerable one, Bhante, if this venerable one says to me: ‘And let the venerable one pardon me.’"<span class="note" id="n1853"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1853] <i>Khamāmahaṁ bhante tassa āyasmato sace maṁ so āyasmā evam āha "khamatu ca me so āyasmā" ti</i>. As I understand this sentence, Sāriputta is simply saying that he will pardon the accusing bhikkhu if the latter asks him for pardon. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp,</a> however, explains this sentence otherwise: "The elder (Sāriputta), having pardoned the monk for his transgression, apologizes to him before the Buddha." This explanation, it seems, has influenced the translation in <i>Gradual Sayings</i>: "Lord, I do pardon that venerable one, if he speak thus to me; and let him, too, pardon me" (<a href="../an/an4.252.html">AN4.252</a>). It is also reflected in NDB&nbsp;233: "I shall forgive him, Lord, if this revered monk asks for my pardon. And he, too, may forgive me." The text itself, however, says nothing about Sāriputta offering an apology to his accuser, since he has done nothing that calls for an apology. Sāriputta is not himself addressing these words to the monk; he is saying that the monk should address these words <i>to him</i> in order to obtain pardon. In other words, so far the monk has apologized only to the Buddha, not to Sāriputta. On principle, Sāriputta can only pardon the monk if the latter asks for pardon. The word <i>ca</i>, "and," occurs in the sentence to be spoken by the monk, presumably, to mean "in addition to the Buddha, let Sāriputta also pardon me."</span></span></span></p>
