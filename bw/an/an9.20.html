<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Then the householder Anāthapiṇḍika approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. The Blessed One asked him:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Are alms given in your family, householder?"</p>

<p>"Alms are given in my family, Bhante, but they consist of broken rice accompanied by rice gruel."<span class="note" id="n1876"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1876] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp:</a> "The Blessed One does not ask this with reference to alms given to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. For in Anāthapiṇḍika's home excellent almsfood was constantly given to the bhikkhus. But the alms being given to the multitude was coarse, which did not please Anāthapiṇḍika. So the Buddha asks with that intention." Mp's explanation sounds contrived, for the expressions the Buddha uses in his response suggest that alms to renunciants were intended. It is possible this sutta was spoken at a time when Anāthapiṇḍika's finances were low. Alternatively, given its legendary character, the sutta may be in part a literary fiction composed for a didactic purpose. A Chinese parallel, MĀ 155, has virtually the same exchange as the Pāli at T I 677a<small>12–13</small>. In another Chinese parallel, EĀ 27.3, Anāthapiṇḍika says (at T II 644b<small>22</small>): "My poor family always practices giving, but the food is coarse and we don’t always give the same" (<img alt="" src="images/000033.jpg" class="calibre121"/>).</span></span></span></p>

<p>"If, householder, one gives alms, coarse or excellent, and one gives disrespectfully, gives inconsiderately, does not give with one's own hand, gives what would be discarded, gives without a view of future consequences,<span class="note" id="n1877"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1877] These are the five ways a bad person gives a gift, as stated at <a href="../an/an5.147.html">AN5.147</a>.

Also, one's <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.393"></a> children and wives, and one's slaves, servants, and workers, do not want to listen to one, do not lend an ear, and do not apply their minds to understand. For what reason? Just this is the result of actions that are done disrespectfully.</p>

Such ways of adorning cattle, though less costly, are still practiced in India today.</span></span></span> (7) eighty-four thousand maidens adorned with jeweled earrings; (8) eighty-four thousand couches <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.394"></a> spread with rugs, blankets, and covers, with excellent coverings of antelope hide, with canopies and red bolsters at both ends; (9) eighty-four thousand <span class="italic">koṭis<span class="note" id="n1881"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1881] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> says that conventionally one <i>koṭi</i> is twenty pairs of cloth, but here ten garments is meant.</span></span></span></span> of cloths made of fine linen, fine silk, fine wool, and fine cotton.

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"You might think, householder: ‘He was someone else, the brahmin Velāma who on that occasion gave that great alms offering.’ But you should not look at it in such a way. I myself was the brahmin Velāma who on that occasion gave that great alms offering.</p>
