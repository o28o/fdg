When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Master Gotama, Pūraṇa Kassapa claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing and to have all-embracing knowledge and vision: ‘Whether I am walking, standing, sleeping, or awake, knowledge and vision are constantly and continuously present to me.’ He says thus: ‘With infinite knowledge, I dwell knowing and seeing the world to be infinite.’ <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.429"></a> But Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta also claims to be all-knowing and all-seeing and to have all-embracing knowledge and vision: ‘Whether I am walking, standing, sleeping, and awake, knowledge and vision are constantly and continuously present to me.’ He says thus: ‘With infinite knowledge, I dwell knowing and seeing the world to be finite.’<span class="note" id="n1933"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1933] Mahāvīra's view of the world is explained in "Various topics prepared on Jain History by Dr. K. C.

The world is eternal as far as that Part 1s concerned which is the substratum <i>(dravya)</i> of the "world"; it is not eternal as far as its ever-changing state is concerned.’ In regard to such questions, Mahāvīra's advice to his disciples was neither to support those who maintained that the world is eternal nor those who advocated that it is not eternal. He would have said the same thing regarding such propositions as the world exists and it does not exist; the world is unchangeable; the world is in constant flux; the world has a beginning; the world has no beginning; <i>the world has an end; the world has no end</i>; etc." (my italics).</span></span></span> When these two claimants to knowledge make claims that are mutually contradictory, who speaks truthfully and who falsely?"</p>

Here <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> says: "<i>Firm-bowed archer</i> <i>(daḷhadhammā dhanuggaho)</i>: an archer who has taken up a firm bow. A ‘firm bow’ <i>(daḷhadhanu)</i> is called the ‘strength of two thousand’ <i>(dvisahassathāmaṁ)</i>: a bow to which one can attach an arrow with a head made of some metal such as bronze or lead, etc., fit the arrow notch to the string, grasp the bow handle and draw back the string the full length of the arrow shaft, and shoot the arrow up from the ground. <i>Trained</i> <i>(sikkhito)</i>: they have studied the craft in their teacher's clan for ten or twelve years. <i>Skillful</i> <i>(katahattho)</i>: one who has simply studied a craft is not yet skillful; they are skillful when they have achieved mastery over it. <i>Experienced</i> <i>(katūpāsano)</i>: one who has exhibited his craft in the king's court, etc."</span></span></span>—across the shadow of a palmyra tree. Their stride was such that it could reach from the eastern ocean to the western ocean. Then the person standing in the eastern quarter would say thus: ‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ Having a life span of a hundred years, living for a hundred years, he might travel for a hundred years without pausing except to eat, drink, chew, and taste, to defecate and urinate, and to dispel fatigue with sleep; yet he would die along the way without having reached the end of the world.<span class="note" id="n1936"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1936] As at <a href="an4.45.html">4:45</a> (and SN <a >2:26</a>, I 61–62).</span></span></span> <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.430"></a> Then the person standing in the western quarter would say thus … the person standing in the northern quarter would say thus … the person standing in the southern quarter would say thus: ‘I will reach the end of the world by traveling.’ Having a life span of a hundred years, living for a hundred years, he might travel for a hundred years without pausing except to eat, drink, chew, and taste, to defecate and urinate, and to dispel fatigue with sleep; yet he would die along the way without having reached the end of the world.
