<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Mallas near the Mallan town named Uruvelakappa.<span class="note" id="n1942"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1942] With <a href="an0-abbr.html">Be</a> and Ee, I read <i>mallesu</i>, as against Ce <i>malatesu</i>. SN <a >42:11</a> is also set at Uruvelakappa, which is said to be a town of the Mallas (see CDB 1348).</span></span></span> Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, took his bowl and robe, and entered Uruvelakappa for alms. When he had walked for alms in Uruvelakappa, after his meal, on returning from his alms round, he addressed the Venerable Ānanda: "You stay right here, Ānanda, while I enter the Great Wood to pass the day."</p>

<p>"Yes, Bhante," the Venerable Ānanda replied. Then the Blessed One entered the Great Wood and sat down to pass the day at the foot of a tree.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the householder Tapussa approached the Venerable Ānanda, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Bhante Ānanda, we laymen enjoy sensual pleasures, delight in sensual pleasures, take delight in sensual pleasures, and rejoice in sensual pleasures. Renunciation seems like a precipice to us. I have heard that in this Dhamma and discipline there are very young bhikkhus, whose minds launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it,<span class="note" id="n1943"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1943] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> glosses <i>vimuccati</i> here as "liberated from the opposing qualities" <i>(paccanīkadhammehi ca vimuccati)</i>. Since all three editions, with the support of <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp,</a> have <i>vimuccati</i>, I translate in conformity with this reading, but I think it likely that the original reading was <i>adhimuccati</i>, "resolved upon" or "focused on." As the text unfolds with respect to the successive meditative attainments, in each case the bodhisatta is <i>vimuccati</i>/<i>adhimuccati</i> upon the attainment <i>before</i> he actually achieves it. In such a context being "focused on" rather than "liberated in" makes better sense.</span></span></span> seeing<span class="note" id="n1944"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1944] <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ce</a> has the genitive plural <i>passataṁ</i>, while Be and Ee have the genitive singular <i>passato</i>. <a href="an0-abbr.html">Mp</a> Be has <i>passato</i> in the lemma and a genitive plural in the gloss: <b>‘</b> <i><b>Etaṁ santan ti passato</b></i> <i>ti etaṁ nekkhammaṁ santaṁ vigatadarathapariḷāhan ti evaṁ passantānaṁ bhikkhūnaṁ</i>. <i>Passato</i> is also found in an older Sinhala edition.

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"This, householder, is a subject that we should see the Blessed One about. Come, let's go to the Blessed One and report this matter to him. We should retain the Blessed One's explanation in mind."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Yes, Bhante," the householder Tapussa replied.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Then the Venerable Ānanda, together with the householder Tapussa, went to the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: "Bhante, this householder Tapussa says: ‘Bhante Ānanda, we laymen enjoy sensual pleasures … <span class="add">and</span> renunciation seems like a precipice to us …. <span class="add">But</span> there are very young bhikkhus whose minds … <span class="add">are</span> liberated in it, seeing it as peaceful.

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"So it is, Ānanda!

<p>(1) "Before my enlightenment, while I was just a bodhisatta, not yet fully enlightened, it occurred to me too: ‘Good is renunciation, good is solitude.’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in sensual pleasures and have not cultivated that <span class="add">insight</span>; I have not achieved the benefit in renunciation and have not <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.440"></a> pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’</p>

<p>"Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I would cultivate that <span class="add">insight</span>, and if, having achieved the benefit in renunciation, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon renunciation and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Sometime later, having seen the danger in sensual pleasures, I cultivated that <span class="add">insight</span>, and having achieved the benefit in renunciation, I pursued it. My mind then launched out upon renunciation and became placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I saw it as peaceful.</p>

<p>"Sometime later, Ānanda, secluded from sensual pleasures … I entered and dwelled in the first jhāna. While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too, when perception and attention accompanied by sensuality occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>(2) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘With the subsiding of thought and examination, let me enter and dwell in the second jhāna ….’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in thoughts and have not cultivated that <span class="add">insight</span>; I have not achieved the benefit in the absence of thought <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.441"></a> and have not pursued it. Therefore my mind does not launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful.’</p>

<p>"Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘If, having seen the danger in thoughts, I would cultivate that <span class="add">insight</span>, and if, having achieved the benefit in the absence of thought, I would pursue it, it is then possible that my mind would launch out upon the absence of thought and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, since I see it as peaceful.’ Then, sometime later, having seen the danger in thoughts, I cultivated that <span class="add">insight</span>, and having achieved the benefit in the absence of thought, I pursued it.

<p>"Sometime later,<span class="note" id="n1947"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1947] I follow <a href="an0-abbr.html">Ee</a> in reading <i>aparena samayena</i> here and in each of the corresponding sections to come.

While I was dwelling in this state, perception and attention accompanied by thought occurred in me and I felt it as an affliction. Just as pain might arise for one feeling pleasure only to afflict him, so too when that perception and attention accompanied by thought occurred in me, I felt it as an affliction.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>(3) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘With the fading away as well of rapture … let me enter and dwell in the third jhāna ….’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the absence of rapture and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the absence of rapture and become placid, settled, <a class="pts_pn" id="an.iv.442"></a> and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in rapture and have not cultivated that <span class="add">insight</span>; I have not achieved the benefit in the absence of rapture and have not pursued it.

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>(4) "Then, Ānanda, it occurred to me: ‘With the abandoning of pleasure and pain … let me enter and dwell in the fourth jhāna ….’ Yet my mind did not launch out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I saw it as peaceful. It occurred to me: ‘Why is it that my mind does not launch out upon the absence of pleasure and pain and become placid, settled, and liberated in it, though I see it as peaceful?’ Then it occurred to me: ‘I have not seen the danger in the pleasure <span class="add">connected with</span> equanimity and have not cultivated that <span class="add">insight</span>; I have not achieved the benefit in the absence of pleasure and pain and have not pursued it.
