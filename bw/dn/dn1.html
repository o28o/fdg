<h3>I. Talk on Wanderers</h3>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n11"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.11] Beside the Rhys Davids translation (RD) there is also the somewhat abridged version by Mrs A.A.G. Bennett in <i>Long Discourses of the Buddha</i> (Bombay 1964, Suttas 1-16 only), and that by David Maurice in <i>The Lion’s Roar</i> (London 1962), both of which I have occasionally found useful. I have also consulted the German partial translation (Suttas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 21, 26, 27) by R.O. Franke (1913), and, as far as my limited knowledge of Thai would allow, the Thai translation (2nd ed., Bangkok 2521 (1978)). <i>Brahma-</i> in the title has the meaning of ‘supreme’.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Exalted One was travelling along the highway between Rājagaha and Nālandā<span class="note" id="n12"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.12] Nālandā, afterwards the seat of a famous Buddhist university, was about 12 km north of Rajagaha (modem Rajgir), the Magadhan capital.</span></span></span> together with a great company of bhikkhus, with about five hundred bhikkhus. At the same time the wanderer Suppiya<span class="note" id="n13"><span class="details">[n.13] A follower of Sañjaya Belatthaputta (see <a href="dn2.html#p3">DN&nbsp;2.33f.</a>). Sāriputta and Moggallana, the Buddha's most famous disciples, were originally followers of Sañjaya, and it was their defection, besides the loss of his gains, that angered Suppiya (DA).</span></span>  was also travelling along the highway between Rājagaha and Nālandā together with his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta. Along the way, the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. But his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in praise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha. Thus these two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the Exalted One together with the company of bhikkhus entered the royal rest-house in the Ambalaṭṭhika garden in order to pass the night. The wanderer Suppiya together with his pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, also entered the royal resthouse in the Ambalaṭṭhika garden in order to pass the night. There, too, the wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, while his pupil Brahmadatta spoke in many ways in their praise. Thus these two, teacher and pupil, dwelt together making assertions in direct contradiction to each other.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>When dawn broke a number of bhikkhus, after rising, assembled in the pavilion. As they sat together, the following conversation sprang up among them: "It is wonderful and marvellous, friends, how the Exalted One, he who knows and sees, the Worthy One, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, while his own pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in their praise. These two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the Exalted One, realizing the turn their discussion had taken, entered the pavilion, sat down on the prepared seat, and addressed the bhikkhus: "What kind of discussion were you holding just now, bhikkhus? What was the subject of your conversation?"</p>

<p>The bhikkhus replied: "When dawn had broken, Lord, after rising we assembled in the pavilion. As we sat here, the following conversation sprang up among us: 'It is wonderful and marvellous friends, how the Exalted One, he who knows and sees, the Worthy One, the perfectly enlightened Buddha, has so thoroughly penetrated the diversity in the dispositions of beings. For this wanderer Suppiya spoke in many ways in dispraise of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Saṅgha, while his own pupil, the youth Brahmadatta, spoke in many ways in their praise. These two, teacher and pupil, followed closely behind the Exalted One and the company of bhikkhus, making assertions in direct contradiction to each other.' This, Lord, was the conversation we were having when the Exalted One arrived."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"If, bhikkhus, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Saṅgha, you should not give way to resentment, displeasure, or animosity against them in your heart. For if you were to become angry or upset in such a situation, you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves. If you were to become angry or upset when others speak in dispraise of us, would you be able to recognize whether their statements are rightly or wrongly spoken?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Certainly not, Lord."</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"If, bhikkhus, others speak in dispraise of me, or in dispraise of the Dhamma, or in dispraise of the Saṅgha, you should unravel what is false and point it out as false, saying: 'For such and such a reason this is false, this is untrue, there is no such thing in us, this is not found among us.
<span class="note" id="n14"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.14] Lit. 'That is not in us'.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"And if, bhikkhus, others speak in praise of me, or in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Saṅgha, you should not give way to jubilation, joy, and exultation in your heart. For if you were to become jubilant, joyful, and exultant in such a situation, you would only be creating an obstacle for yourselves. If others speak in praise of me, or in praise of the Dhamma, or in praise of the Saṅgha, you should acknowledge what is fact as fact, saying: 'For such and such a reason this is a fact, this is true, there is such a thing in us, this is found among us.'</p>

And because he is free from misapprehension, he has realized within himself the state of perfect peace.

But it is not at that point that the self attains supreme Nibbāna here and now. What is the reason?

Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be.</p>

<h3>5. The Ending of the Round (<i>Vivaṭṭakathādi</i>)</h3>

<p id="p212"><span class="parno">212</span>"When, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu understands as they really are the origin and passing away of the six bases of contact, their satisfaction, unsatisfactoriness, and the escape from them, then he understands what transcends all these views.</p>

<p id="p213"><span class="parno">213</span>"Whatever recluses or brahmins, bhikkhus, are speculators about the past, speculators about the future, speculators about the past and the future together, hold settled views about the past and the future and assert various conceptual theorems referring to the past and the future—all are trapped in this net with its sixty-two divisions. Whenever they emerge, they emerge caught within this net, trapped and contained within this very net.</p>

<p id="p214"><span class="parno">214</span>"Just as, bhikkhus, a skillful fisherman or a fisherman's apprentice, after spreading a fine-meshed net over a small pool of water, might think: 'Whatever sizeable creatures there are in this pool, all are trapped within this net, trapped and contained in this very net'—in the same way, all those recluses and brahmins are trapped in this net with its sixty-two divisions. Whenever they emerge, they emerge caught within this net, trapped and contained within this very net.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p215"><span class="parno">215</span>"The body of the Tathāgata, bhikkhus, stands with the leash that bound it to existence cut.<span class="note" id="n87"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.87] All that formerly bound him to the cycle of rebirth.</span></span></span> As long as his body stands, gods and men shall see him. But with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the life-faculty, gods and men shall see him no more.</p>

<p id="p216"><span class="parno">216</span>"Just as, bhikkhus, when the stalk of a bunch of mangoes has been cut, all the mangoes connected to the stalk follow along with it, in the same way, the body of the Tathāgata stands with the leash that bound it to existence cut. As long as his body stands, gods and men shall see him. But with the breakup of the body and the exhaustion of the life-faculty, gods and men shall see him no more."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p217"><span class="parno">217</span>When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda said to the Exalted One: "It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvelous! What is the title, venerable sir, of this exposition of the Dhamma?"</p>

<p>"Ānanda, you may remember this exposition of the Dhamma as the Net of the Good, as the Net of the Dhamma, as the Supreme Net, as the Net of Views. You may remember it also as the Incomparable Victory in Battle."</p>

<p id="p218"><span class="parno">218</span>Thus spoke the Exalted One. Elated in mind, the bhikkhus delighted in the word of the Exalted One. And while this exposition was being spoken, the ten-thousandfold world system shook.</p>
