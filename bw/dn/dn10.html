<h3><span class="add">Morality, Concentration, Wisdom</span></h3>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n225"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.225] We may wonder slightly, as RD does, why this is included as a separate Sutta, consisting as it does of little more than the corresponding passages in <a href="../dn/dn2.html">DN&nbsp;2</a>. But repetitiveness was never regarded by the early redactors of the Canon as a bar to inclusion, and this was no doubt independently preserved as an account of Subha's conversion. RD points out that the three heads here are given as sīla, samādhi and paññā, which we render (somewhat differently from RD) as morality, concentration and wisdom. RD also states that the term samādhi is not found in any pre-Buddhist text. To his remarks on the subject should be added that its subsequent use in Hindu texts to denote the state of enlightenment is not in conformity with Buddhist usage, where the basic meaning of concentration is expanded to cover 'meditation' in general.</span></span></span> Once the Venerable Ananda was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jeta's grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika's park, shortly after the Lord's final passing.<span class="note" id="n226"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.226] Chronology is of little account in this Nikāya. The Buddha’s final passing is narrated in <a href="../dn/dn16.html">DN&nbsp;16</a>.</span></span></span> And at that time the youth Subha, Todeyya's son,<span class="note" id="n227"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.227] A Brahmin, whose name means 'man of Tudi'.</span></span></span> was staying at Sāvatthī on some business.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>And Subha said to a certain young man: 'Go, my lad, to where the ascetic Ananda is, ask him in my name if he is in good health, free from fatigue, strong, vigorous and dwelling in comfort, and say: "It would be good if the Reverend Ananda would, out of compassion, visit the dwelling of Subha the son of Todeyya."'</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>'Very good, sir', replied the young man. Then he went to the Venerable Ananda, exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. Then he delivered the message.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>The Venerable Ananda replied: 'It is not the right time, young man. Today I have taken some medicine. Perhaps it will be possible to come tomorrow when the time and the occasion are suitable.'</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>And the young man rose, returned to Subha and reported what had passed between him and the Venerable Ananda, adding: 'My mission has been thus far accomplished, that the Reverend Ananda will probably take the opportunity to come tomorrow.'</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>And indeed, as that night was ending, the Venerable Ananda dressed in the early morning, took his robe and bowl and, accompanied by the Venerable Cetaka,<span class="note" id="n228"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.228] Like Todeyya, he is named after his birthplace in the Cetiya country.</span></span></span> came to Subha's dwelling, and sat down on the prepared seat.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then Subha approached the Venerable Ananda, exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. Then he said:</p>

<p>'The Reverend Ananda was for a long time the Reverend Gotama's personal attendant, dwelling in his presence and near him. You, Reverend Ananda, would know what things the Reverend Gotama praised, and with which he aroused, exhorted and established people. Which, Reverend Ananda, were those things?'</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>'Subha, there were three divisions of things which the Lord praised, and with which he aroused, exhorted and established people. Which three? The division of Ariyan morality,<span class="note" id="n229"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.229] <i>Sīlakkhandha.</i> This is also the name of the first of the three divisions of this Nikāya, but the other two do not conform to the same pattern.</span></span></span> the division of Ariyan concentration, and the division of Ariyan wisdom. These were the three divisions of things which the Lord praised…'</p>

<h3>The Section on Morality</h3>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>'Well, Reverend Ananda, what is the division of Ariyan morality which the Reverend Gotama praised … ?'</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>'Young sir, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.</p>

<p>"A householder, or a householder's son, or one born into some other family, hears the Dhamma. Having heard the Dhamma, he gains faith in the Tathāgata. Endowed with such faith, he reflects: 'The household life is crowded, a path of dust. Going forth is like the open air. It is not easy for one dwelling at home to lead the perfectly complete, perfectly purified holy life, bright as a polished conch. Let me then shave off my hair and beard, put on saffron robes, and go forth from home to homelessness.'
<br>
<p>"After some time he abandons his accumulation of wealth, be it large or small; he abandons his circle of relatives, be it large or small; he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on saffron robes, and goes forth from home to homelessness.
<br>
<p>"When he has thus gone forth, he lives restrained by the restraint of the Pāṭimokkha, possessed of proper behaviour and resort. Having taken up the rules of training, he trains himself in them, seeing danger in the slightest faults. He comes to be endowed with wholesome bodily and verbal action, his livelihood is purified, and he is possessed of moral discipline. He guards the doors of his sense faculties, is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension, and is content.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"And how, young sir, is the bhikkhu possessed of moral discipline? Herein, young sir, having abandoned the destruction of life, the bhikkhu abstains from the destruction of life. He has laid down the rod and weapon and dwells conscientious, full of kindness, sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings. This pertains to his moral discipline.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Whereas some recluses and brahmins, while living on the food offered by the faithful, earn their living by a wrong means of livelihood, by such debased arts as:</p>

<ul><li>promising gifts to deities in return for favours</li>
<li>fulfilling such promises</li>
<li>demonology</li>
<li>reciting spells after entering an earthen house</li>
<li>inducing virility and impotence</li>
<li>preparing and consecrating sites for a house</li>
<li>giving ceremonial mouthwashes and ceremonial bathing</li>
<li>offering sacrificial fires</li>
<li>administering emetics, purgatives, expectorants, and phlegmagogues</li>
<li>administering medicines through the ear and through the nose, administering ointments and counter-ointments, practising fine surgery on the eyes and ears, practising general surgery on the body, practising as a children's doctor—</li>
</ul>

<p>he abstains from such wrong means of livelihood, from such debased arts. This too pertains to his moral discipline.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"Young sir, the bhikkhu who is thus possessed of moral discipline sees no danger anywhere in regard to his restraint by moral discipline. Just as a head-anointed noble warrior who has defeated his enemies sees no danger anywhere from his enemies, so the bhikkhu who is thus possessed of moral discipline sees no danger anywhere in regard to his restraint by moral discipline. Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline, he experiences within himself a blameless happiness. In this way, young sir, the bhikkhu is possessed of moral discipline.</p>

<p>Thus a monk is perfected in morality.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>'That is the division of Ariyan morality which the Lord praised… But something more remains to be done.'</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>'It is wonderful, Reverend Ananda, it is marvellous! This division of Ariyan morality is perfectly fulfilled, not left incomplete. And I do not see this division of Ariyan morality fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schools. And if any of them were to have found this perfection in themselves, they would have been so delighted that they would have said: "We've done enough! The goal of our asceticism has been reached! There's nothing more to be done!" And yet the Reverend Ananda declares that there is more to be done!'</p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="add">End of first recitation-section</span></p>

<h3>The Section on Concentration</h3>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>'Reverend Ananda, what is the division of Ariyan concentration which the Reverend Gotama praised? …'

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"And how, young sir, does the bhikkhu guard the doors of his sense faculties? Herein, young sir, having seen a form with the eye, the bhikkhu does not grasp at the sign or the details. Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the eye, evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the eye, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the eye. Having heard a sound with the ear … having smelled an odour with the nose … having tasted a flavour with the tongue … having touched a tangible object with the body … having cognized a mind-object with the mind, the bhikkhu does not grasp at the sign or the details. Since, if he were to dwell without restraint over the faculty of the mind, evil unwholesome states such as covetousness and grief might assail him, he practises restraint, guards the faculty of the mind, and achieves restraint over the faculty of the mind. Endowed with this noble restraint of the sense faculties, he experiences within himself an unblemished happiness. In this way, young sir, the bhikkhu guards the doors of the sense faculties.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"And how, young sir, is the bhikkhu endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension? Herein, young sir, in going forward and returning, the bhikkhu acts with clear comprehension. In looking ahead and looking aside, he acts with clear comprehension. In bending and stretching the limbs, he acts with clear comprehension. In wearing his robes and cloak and using his alms-bowl, he acts with clear comprehension. In eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting, he acts with clear comprehension. In defecating and urinating, he acts with clear comprehension. In going, standing, sitting, lying down, waking up, speaking, and remaining silent, he acts with clear comprehension. In this way, young sir, the bhikkhu is endowed with mindfulness and clear comprehension.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"And how, young sir, is the bhikkhu content? Herein, young sir, a bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to sustain his belly; wherever he goes he sets out taking only (his requisites) along with him. Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden, in the same way a bhikkhu is content with robes to protect his body and almsfood to sustain his belly; wherever he goes he sets out taking only (his requisites) along with him. In this way, young sir, the bhikkhu is content.</p>

<p><p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"Endowed with this noble aggregate of moral discipline, this noble restraint over the sense faculties, this noble mindfulness and clear comprehension, and this noble contentment, he resorts to a secluded dwelling—a forest, the foot of a tree, a mountain, a glen, a hillside cave, a cremation ground, a jungle grove, the open air, a heap of straw. After returning from his alms-round, following his meals, he sits down, crosses his legs, holds his body erect, and sets up mindfulness before him.</p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"Having abandoned covetousness for the world, he dwells with a mind free from covetousness; he purifies his mind from covetousness. Having abandoned ill will and hatred, he dwells with a benevolent mind, sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings; he purifies his mind from ill will and hatred. Having abandoned dullness and drowsiness, he dwells perceiving light, mindful and clearly comprehending; he purifies his mind from dullness and drowsiness. Having abandoned restlessness and worry, he dwells at ease within himself, with a peaceful mind; he purifies his mind from restlessness and worry. Having abandoned doubt, he dwells as one who has passed beyond doubt, unperplexed about wholesome states; he purifies his mind from doubt.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>"Young sir, suppose a man were to take a loan and apply it to his business, and his business were to succeed, so that he could pay back his old debts and would have enough money left over to maintain a wife. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>"Again, young sir, suppose a man were to become sick, afflicted, gravely ill, so that he could not enjoy his food and his strength would decline. After some time he would recover from that illness and would enjoy his food and regain his bodily strength. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>"Again, young sir, suppose a man were locked up in a prison. After some time he would be released from prison, safe and secure, with no loss of his possessions. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>"Again, young sir, suppose a man were a slave, without independence, subservient to others, unable to go where he wants. After some time he would be released from slavery and gain his independence; he would no longer be subservient to others but a free man able to go where he wants. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>"Again, young sir, suppose a man with wealth and possessions were travelling along a desert road where food was scarce and dangers were many. After some time he would cross over the desert and arrive safely at a village which is safe and free from danger. He would reflect on this, and as a result he would become glad and experience joy.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>"In the same way, young sir, when a bhikkhu sees that these five hindrances are unabandoned within himself, he regards that as a debt, as a sickness, as confinement in prison, as slavery, as a desert road.</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>"But when he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, he regards that as freedom from debt, as good health, as release from prison, as freedom from slavery, as a place of safety.</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>"When he sees that these five hindrances have been abandoned within himself, gladness arises. When he is gladdened, rapture arises. When his mind is filled with rapture, his body becomes tranquil; tranquil in body, he experiences happiness; being happy, his mind becomes concentrated.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>"Quite secluded from sense pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought and filled with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion. He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with this rapture and happiness born of seclusion, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness.</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>"Young sir, suppose a skilled bath attendant or his apprentice were to pour soap-powder into a metal basin, sprinkle it with water, and knead it into a ball, so that the ball of soap-powder be pervaded by moisture, encompassed by moisture, suffused with moisture inside and out, yet would not trickle. In the same way, young sir, the bhikkhu drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with the rapture and happiness born of seclusion, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>"Further, young sir, with the subsiding of applied and sustained thought, the bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which is accompanied by internal confidence and unification of mind, is without applied and sustained thought, and is filled with the rapture and happiness born of concentration. He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with this rapture and happiness born of concentration, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness.</p>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>"Young sir, suppose there were a deep lake whose waters welled up from below. It would have no inlet for water from the east, west, north, or south, nor would it be refilled from time to time with showers of rain; yet a current of cool water, welling up from within the lake, would drench, steep, saturate and suffuse the whole lake, so that there would be no part of that entire lake which is not suffused with the cool water. In the same way, young sir, the bhikkhu drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with the rapture and happiness born of concentration, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this rapture and happiness.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>"Further, young sir, with the fading away of rapture, the bhikkhu dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly comprehending, and experiences happiness with the body. Thus he enters and dwells in the third jhāna, of which the noble ones declare: 'He dwells happily with equanimity and mindfulness.' He drenches, steeps, saturates, and suffuses his body with this happiness free from rapture, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this happiness.</p>

In the same way, young sir, the bhikkhu drenches, steeps, saturates and suffuses his body with the happiness free from rapture, so that there is no part of his entire body which is not suffused by this happiness.</p>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>"Young sir, suppose a man were to be sitting covered from the head down by a white cloth, so that there would be no part of his entire body not suffused by the white cloth.

<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>"When his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright, unblemished, free from defects, malleable, wieldy, steady and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision.

And running through it there is this blue, yellow, red, white, or brown thread.' In the same way, young sir, when his mind is thus concentrated, pure and bright … the bhikkhu directs and inclines it to knowledge and vision and understands thus: 'This is my body, having material form … . and this is my consciousness, supported by it and bound up with it.'
