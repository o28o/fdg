<h3>Dependent Arising</h3>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="318"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.318] See <i>The Great Discourse on Causation: The Mahānidāna Sutta and its Commentaries,</i> translated from the Pali by Bhikkhu Bodhi, (BPS 1984).</span></span></span> On one occasion the Exalted One was living among the Kurus, where there was a town of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma.<span class="note" id="n319"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.319] There was nowhere in the town for the Buddha to stay, so he stayed outside, in the jungle: hence the construction 'There is a market town' (DA).</span></span></span> Then the Venerable Ānanda approached the Exalted One, paid homage to him, and sat down to one side. Seated, he said to the Exalted One:</p>

<p>"It is wonderful and marvellous, venerable sir, how this dependent arising is so deep and appears so deep, yet to myself it seems as clear as clear can be."</p>

<p>"Do not say so, Ānanda! Do not say so, Ānanda! This dependent arising, Ānanda, is deep and it appears deep. Because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma, Ānanda, this generation has become like a tangled skein, like a knotted ball of thread,<span class="note" id="n320"><span class="details"><span class="p">[320] <i>Gulāgunthika-jāta:</i> or ‘matted like a bird’s nest.’</span></span></span> like matted rushes and reeds, and does not pass beyond saṁsāra with its plane of misery, unfortunate destinations, and lower realms.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Ānanda, if one is asked: 'Are aging and death due to a specific condition?'<span class="note" id="n321"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.321] <i>Idapaccayā.</i> Cf. <a href="dn14.html#n291">n.291.</a></span></span></span> one should say: 'They are.' If one is asked: 'Through what condition is there aging and death?' one should say: 'With birth as condition there is aging and death.'</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Ānanda, if one is asked: 'Is birth due to a specific condition?' one should say: 'It is.' If one is asked: 'Through what condition is there birth?' one should say: 'With existence as condition there is birth.'</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Ānanda, if one is asked: 'Is existence due to a specific condition?' one should say: 'It is.' If one is asked: 'Through what condition is there existence?' one should say: 'With clinging as condition there is existence.'</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Ānanda, if one is asked: 'Is clinging due to a specific condition?' one should say: 'It is.' If one is asked: 'Through what condition is there clinging?' one should say: 'With craving as condition there is clinging.'</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Ānanda, if one is asked: 'Is craving due to a specific condition?' one should say: 'It is.' If one is asked: 'Through what condition is there craving?' one should say: 'With feeling as condition there is craving.'</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Ānanda, if one is asked: 'Is feeling due to a specific condition?' one should say: 'It is.' If one is asked: 'Through what condition is there feeling?' one should say: 'With contact as condition there is feeling.'</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"Ānanda, if one is asked: 'Is contact due to a specific condition?' one should say: 'It is.' If one is asked: 'Through what condition is there contact?' one should say: 'With mentality-materiality as condition there is contact.'<span class="note" id="n323"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.323] The six sense-bases are omitted, for some reason, in this Sutta.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Ānanda, if one is asked: 'Is mentality-materiality due to a specific condition?' one should say: 'It is.' If one is asked: 'Through what condition is there mentality-materiality?' one should say: 'With consciousness as condition there is mentality-materiality.'</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Ānanda, if one is asked: 'Is consciousness due to a specific condition?' one should say: 'It is.'

<hr>
<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Thus, Ānanda, with mentality-materiality as condition there is consciousness; with consciousness as condition there is mentality-materiality; with mentality-materiality as condition there is contact; with contact as condition there is feeling; with feeling as condition there is craving; with craving as condition there is clinging; with clinging as condition there is existence; with existence as condition there is birth; and with birth as condition, aging and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair come to be. Such is the origin of this entire mass of suffering.</p>

<h4>Aging and Death</h4>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"It was said: 'With birth as condition there is aging and death.' How that is so, Ānanda, should be understood in this way: If there were absolutely and utterly no birth of any kind anywhere—that is, of gods into the state of gods, of celestials into the state of celestials, of spirits, demons,<span class="note" id="n326"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.326] <i>Bhūtānaṁ:</i> ‘beings’, but the term is sometimes used in the sense of ‘ghosts’. The Sub-Commentary identifies them with the Kumbhaṇḍas mentioned at <a href="../dn/dn32.html">DN&nbsp;32</a>. (q.v.).</span></span></span> human beings, quadrupeds, winged creatures, and reptiles, each into their own state—if there were no birth of beings of any sort into any state, then, in the complete absence of birth, with the cessation of birth, would aging and death be discerned?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"Therefore, Ānanda, this is the cause, source, origin, and condition for aging and death, namely, birth.</p>

<h4>Birth</h4>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"It was said: 'With existence as condition there is birth.' How that is so, Ānanda, should be understood in this way: If there were absolutely and utterly no existence of any kind anywhere—that is, no sense-sphere existence, fine-material existence, or immaterial existence—then, in the complete absence of existence, with the cessation of existence, would birth be discerned?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"Therefore, Ānanda, this is the cause, source, origin, and condition for birth, namely, existence.</p>

<h4>Existence</h4>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"It was said: 'With clinging as condition there is existence.' How that is so, Ānanda, should be understood in this way: If there were absolutely and utterly no clinging of any kind anywhere—that is, no clinging to sense pleasures, clinging to views, clinging to precepts and observances, or clinging to a doctrine of self—then, in the complete absence of clinging, with the cessation of clinging, would existence be discerned?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"Therefore, Ānanda, this is the cause, source, origin, and condition for existence, namely, clinging.</p>

<h4>Clinging</h4>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"It was said: 'With craving as condition there is clinging.' How that is so, Ānanda, should be understood in this way: If there were absolutely and utterly no craving of any kind anywhere—that is, no craving for visible forms, craving for sounds, craving for smells, craving for tastes, craving for tangibles, or craving for mental objects—then, in the complete absence of craving, with the cessation of craving, would clinging be discerned?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"Therefore, Ānanda, this is the cause, source, origin, and condition for clinging, namely, craving.</p>

<h4>Craving</h4>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"It was said: 'With feeling as condition there is craving.' How that is so, Ānanda, should be understood in this way: If there were absolutely and utterly no feeling of any kind anywhere—that is, no feeling born of eye-contact, feeling born of ear-contact, feeling born of nose-contact, feeling born of tongue-contact, feeling born of body-contact, or feeling born of mind-contact—then, in the complete absence of feeling, with the cessation of feeling, would craving be discerned?"</p>

<p>"Certainly not, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"Therefore, Ānanda, this is the cause, source, origin, and condition for craving, namely, feeling.

<h3>Considerations of Self</h3>

<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>"In what ways, Ānanda, does one considering (the idea of) self consider it? One considering (the idea of) self either considers feeling as self, saying: 'Feeling is my self.'<span class="note" id="n343"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.343] Identifying the (supposed) self with the feeling-aggregate (<i>vedanā-kkhandha</i>).</span></span></span> Or he considers: 'Feeling is not my self; my self is without experience of feeling.' Or he considers: 'Feeling is not my self, but my self is not without experience of feeling.<span class="note" id="n344"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.344] Identifying the self with the body-aggregate.</span></span></span> My self feels; for my self is subject to feeling.'<span class="note" id="n345"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.345] Identifying the self with the aggregates of perception, mental formations and consciousness. Such are the commentarial explanations.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>"Therein, Ānanda, the one who says 'Feeling is my self' should be asked: 'Friend, there are these three kinds of feeling—pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling. Of these three kinds of feeling, which do you consider as self?'</p>

<p>"Ānanda, on the occasion when one experiences a pleasant feeling one does not, on that same occasion, experience a painful feeling or a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling; on that occasion one experiences only a pleasant feeling. On the occasion when one experiences a painful feeling one does not, on that same occasion, experience a pleasant feeling or a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling; on that occasion one experiences only a painful feeling. On the occasion when one experiences a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling one does not, on that same occasion, experience a pleasant feeling or a painful feeling; on that occasion one experiences only a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>"Ānanda, pleasant feeling is impermanent, conditioned,<span class="note" id="n346"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.346] <i>Sankhata:</i> as opposed to the ‘unconditioned element’, which is Nibbāna.</span></span></span> dependently arisen, subject to destruction, falling away, fading out, and ceasing. Painful feeling is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, falling away, fading out, and ceasing. Neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen, subject to destruction, falling away, fading out, and ceasing.</p>

<p>"If, when experiencing a pleasant feeling, one thinks: 'This is my self,' then with the ceasing of that pleasant feeling one thinks: 'My self has disappeared.' If, when experiencing a painful feeling, one thinks: 'This is my self,' then with the ceasing of that painful feeling one thinks: 'My self has disappeared.' If, when experiencing a neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, one thinks: 'This is my self,' then with the ceasing of that neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling one thinks: 'My self has disappeared.'</p>

<p>"Thus one who says 'Feeling is my self' considers as self something which, even here and now, is impermanent, a mixture of pleasure and pain, and subject to arising and falling away. Therefore, Ānanda, because of this it is not acceptable to consider: 'Feeling is my self.'</p>

<p id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>"Ānanda, the one who says 'Feeling is not my self; my self is without experience of feeling'—he should be asked: 'Friend, where there is nothing at all that is felt, could the idea "I am"<span class="note" id="nb32"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.b32] The Burmese edition reads <i>ayam aham asmi,</i> “I am this.” The PTS edition’s <i>asmi,</i> “I am,” is confirmed by the commentary.

<p>"Certainly not, venerable sir."<span class="note" id="n347"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.347] The MSS appear to ascribe these answers to Ananda himself rather than the hypothetical interlocutor.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>"Therefore, Ānanda, because of this it is not acceptable to consider: 'Feeling is not my self; my self is without experience of feeling.'</p>

<p id="p45"><span class="parno">45</span>"Ānanda, the one who says 'Feeling is not my self, but my self is not without experience of feeling. My self feels; for my self is subject to feeling'<span class="note" id="n348"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.348] I.e. this feeling.</span></span></span> — he should be asked: 'Friend, if feeling were to cease absolutely and utterly without remainder, then, in the complete absence of feeling, with the cessation of feeling, could (the idea) "I am this" occur there?'."</p>

<p>"Certainly not, venerable sir."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Therefore, Ānanda, because of this it is not acceptable to consider: 'Feeling is not my self, but my self is not without experience of feeling. My self feels; for my self is subject to feeling.'</p>

<p id="p46"><span class="parno">46</span>"Ānanda, when a bhikkhu does not consider feeling as self, and does not consider self as without experience of feeling, and does not consider: 'My self feels; for my self is subject to feeling'—then, being without such considerations, he does not cling to anything in the world. Not clinging, he is not agitated. Not being agitated, he personally attains nibbāna.<span class="note" id="n349"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.349] He gains Nibbāna for himself (individually: <i>paccattaṁ</i>).</span></span></span> He understands: 'Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no returning to this state of being.'</p>

<p>"Ānanda, if anyone should say of a bhikkhu whose mind has been thus liberated, that he holds the view 'A Tathāgata exists after death'<span class="note" id="n350"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.350] Cf. <a href="../dn/dn1.html">DN&nbsp;1</a>.2.27.</span></span></span> —that would not be proper; or that he holds the view 'A Tathāgata does not exist after death'—that would not be proper; or that he holds the view 'A Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death'—that would not be proper; or that he holds the view 'A Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death'—that would not be proper. For what reason? Because that bhikkhu is liberated by directly knowing this: the extent of designation and the extent of the pathway for designation, the extent of language and the extent of the pathway for language, the extent of description and the extent of the pathway for description, the extent of wisdom and the extent of the sphere for wisdom, the extent of the round and the extent to which the round turns. To say of a bhikkhu who is liberated by directly knowing this<span class="note" id="n351"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.351] <i>Abhiññā.</i></span></span></span> that he holds the view 'One does not know and does not see'—that would not be proper.</p>

<h3>The Seven Stations for Consciousness</h3>

<p id="p47"><span class="parno">47</span>"Ānanda, there are these seven stations for consciousness<span class="note" id="n352"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.352] RD makes heavy weather of this in his note. These are the ‘places’ or ‘states’ in which conscious rebirth takes place. The stations also occur at AN 7.41 (not 39, 40, as stated by RD).</span></span></span> and two bases.<span class="note" id="n353"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.353] <i>Ayatanāni:</i> normally translated ‘spheres’, is here rendered ‘realms’ to avoid confusion with the ‘spheres’ of Infinite Space, etc., included among the seven ‘stations’. Glossed as <i>nivāsanatthānāni</i> ‘dwelling-places’, they clearly differ from the station as being where unconscious (or not fully conscious) rebirth takes place.</span></span></span> What are the seven?</p>

<p>"There are, Ānanda, beings who are diverse in body and diverse in perception, such as human beings, some gods, and some beings in the lower realms. This is the first station for consciousness.</p>

<p>"There are beings who are diverse in body but identical in perception, such as the gods of the Brahma-order who are generated through the first (<i>jhāna</i>). This is the second station for consciousness.</p>

<p>"There are beings who are identical in body but diverse in perception, such as the gods of streaming radiance.<span class="note" id="n354"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.354] Cf. <a href="../dn/dn1.html#p2">DN&nbsp;1.2.</a></span></span></span> This is the third station for consciousness.</p>

<p>"There are beings who are identical in body and identical in perception, such as the gods of refulgent beauty. This is the fourth station for consciousness.</p>

<p>"There are beings who, through the complete surmounting of perceptions of material form, the passing away of perceptions of impingement, and non-attention to perceptions of diversity, (contemplating) 'Space is infinite,' arrive at the base of the infinity of space. This is the fifth station for consciousness.</p>

<p>"There are beings who, having completely surmounted the base of the infinity of space, (contemplating) 'Consciousness is infinite,' arrive at the base of the infinity of consciousness. This is the sixth station for consciousness.</p>

<p>There are beings who, having completely surmounted the base of the infinity of consciousness, (contemplating) 'There is nothing,' arrive at the base of nothingness. This is the seventh station for consciousness.</p>

<p>"The base of non-percipient beings and, second, the base of neither perception nor non-perception—(these are the two bases).</p>

<hr>
<p id="p48"><span class="parno">48</span>"Therein, Ānanda, if one understands the first station for consciousness, that of beings who are diverse in body and diverse in perception, and if one understands its origin, its passing away, its satisfaction, its unsatisfactoriness, and the escape from it, is it proper for one to seek enjoyment in it?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Certainly not, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"If one understands the remaining stations for consciousness … the base of non-percipient beings … the base of neither perception nor non-perception, and if one understands its origin, its passing away, its satisfaction, its unsatisfactoriness, and the escape from it, is it proper for one to seek enjoyment in it?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Certainly not, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"Ānanda, when a bhikkhu—having understood as they really are the origin, passing away, satisfaction, unsatisfactoriness, and escape in regard to these seven stations for consciousness and two bases—is liberated through non-clinging, then he is called a bhikkhu liberated by wisdom.<span class="note" id="n355"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.355] <i>Paññā-vimutto.</i> Mrs RD’s translation ‘Freed-by-Reason’ is certainly misleading, even if learnedly supported by a reference to Kant’s Vernunft! The usual rendering of paññā is ‘wisdom’, though Ñāṇamoli prefers ‘understanding’. It is the true wisdom which is born of insight. The important point is the commentarial statement that this means: ‘liberation without the aid of the following eight “liberations”’. It will be noticed that ‘stations’ 5-7 formally correspond to ‘liberations’ 4-6. The difference is that by the first way these ‘stations’ are seen through with insight and rejected, whereas by the second way they are used as means towards liberation.</span></span></span></p>
