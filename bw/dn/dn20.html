<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus I have heard:<span class="note" id="n564"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.564] This is another curious document, doubtless an example of what RD calls ‘a mnemonic doggrel as was found useful in other cases also by the early Buddhists, who had no books, and were compelled to carry their dictionaries and works of reference in their heads.’ A Sanskrit version from Central Asia has been published, with English translation, by E. Waldschmidt in LEBT, pp. 149-162, and there are also Chinese and Tibetan versions, all of which are quite close to the Pali in general. RD considers the poem (if such we can call it) ‘almost unreadable now’, because ‘the long list of strange names awakes no interest.’ That was in 1910. Possibly modem readers who know their Tolkien may think otherwise. At any rate I have not felt it necessary to try to follow up all the allusions, some of which remain obscure or dubious.</span></span></span> at one time the Gracious One was dwelling amongst the Sakyans in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu with a great Saṅgha of monks consisting of five hundred monks, all of them Worthy Ones, and almost all of the gods from the ten world-elements<span class="note" id="n565"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.565] RD has, wrongly, ‘ten thousand world-systems’. The Sanskrit confirms the lower figure.</span></span></span> had assembled to see the Gracious One and the Saṅgha of monks.</p>

<p>Then this occurred to four gods from among the hosts in the Pure Abodes:<span class="note" id="n566"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.566] The realm where Non-Returners dwell before gaining final Nibbāna. The Sanskrit has deities (<i>devatā</i> — rendered ʹgoddessesʹ(!) by Waldschmidt) from the Brahma world.</span></span></span> "The Gracious One is dwelling amongst the Sakyans in the Great Wood near Kapilavatthu with a great Saṅgha of monks consisting of five hundred monks, all of them Worthy Ones, and almost all of the gods from the ten world elements have assembled to see the Gracious One and the Saṅgha of monks. Well now, we too could approach the Gracious One, and after approaching the Gracious One we could recite a verse each in his presence."</p>

<p>Then those gods, just as a strong man might stretch out a bent arm, or bend in an outstretched arm, in the same way disappeared from among the gods of the Pure Abodes and appeared in front of the Gracious One. Then those gods after worshipping the Gracious One, stood on one side. While standing on one side one of the gods recited this verse in the presence of the Gracious One:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2" class="verse"><span class="parno">2</span>"There is a great convention in the wood,
<br>and a host of gods have come,
<br>we have come to this Dhamma convention
<br>to see the Saṅgha, who are undefeated."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then another god recited this verse in the presence of the Gracious One:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"In this place the monks are concentrated,
<br>they have straightened out their minds by themselves,
<br>like a charioteer who has taken the reins,
<br>the wise protect their sense faculties."</p>
</div>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then another god recited this verse in the presence of the Gracious One:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Having cut off the hindrance and obstacle,
<br>and dug up the locking post, they are unmoved,
<br>they live pure and unstained,
<br>young nāgas, well-tamed by the Visionary."</p>
</div>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then another god recited this verse in the presence of the Gracious One: </p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"Whoever has gone to the Buddha for refuge
<br>will not go to the lower worlds.
<br>After giving up the human body
<br>they will fill up the ranks of the gods."</p>
</div>

<h4>The Great Assembly</h4>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Then the Gracious One addressed the monks, saying: "Monks, almost all of the gods from the ten world-elements have assembled to see the Realised One and the Saṅgha of monks. Monks, those who in the past were Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas, for those Gracious Ones also at least as many gods have assembled as for me at the present time. Monks, those who in the future will be Worthy Ones, Perfect Sambuddhas, for those Gracious Ones also at least as many gods will assemble as for me at the present time.</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>Monks, I will declare the names of the hosts of gods, monks, I will proclaim the names of the hosts of gods, monks, I will reveal the names of the hosts of gods. Listen to it, apply your minds well, and I will speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, reverend Sir," those monks replied to the Gracious One, and the Gracious One said this:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p11" class="verse"><span class="parno">11</span>"I will repeat a famous verse <span class="supplied">(a <i>Siloka</i>)</span>

<p id="p12" class="verse"><span class="parno">12</span>who are like lions crouching,
