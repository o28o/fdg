<section class="raw_sutta">  <!-- English and Pali -->
<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n624"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.624] This is generally regarded as the most important Sutta in the entire Pali Canon. It recurs verbatim at <a href="../mn/mn10.html">MN&nbsp;10</a> as the Satipatthana Sutta, with the omission of verses 18–21. The text (or that of <a href="../mn/mn10.html">MN&nbsp;10</a>) has been separately translated a number of times, notably by Soma Thera as <i>The Way of Mindfulness</i> (2nd ed. Colombo 1949, 3rd ed. BPS 1967). The important book <i>The Heart of Buddhist Meditation</i> by Nyāṇaponika Mahāthera (Colombo 1954, London 1973 and later) is essentially based on this Sutta and contains a translation, not only of this but of other relevant texts from the Pali Canon and from Mahayana sources (especially Santideva's Sikṣāsamuccaya). The author's remark in the Introduction should also be noted: 'Among the Mahayana schools of the Far East, it is chiefly the Chinese Ch'an and Japanese Zen that are closest to the spirit of Satipaṭṭhāna. Notwithstanding the differences in method, aim and basic philosophical conceptions, the connecting links with Satipaṭṭhāna are close and strong, and it is regrettable that they have hardly been stressed or noticed.' It should however be mentioned that since those words were written, the realisation has begun to dawn that Zen has much in common with Theravāda in general, and the Satipaṭṭhāna method in particular — somewhat to the surprise of some who have overstressed the 'uniqueness' of Zen. The cross-headings in this Sutta correspond closely to those used by the Ven. Ñāṇamoli for MN 10.</span></span></span> Once the Lord was staying among the Kurus. There is a market-town of theirs called Kammāsadhamma.<span class="note" id="n625"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.625] Or Kammāsadhamma. There was nowhere in the town for the Buddha to stay, so he stayed outside, in the jungle: hence the construction 'There is a market town' (DA). See also <a href="dn15.html#1">DN15</a> for the same construction.</span></span></span> And there the Lord addressed the monks: 'Monks!' 'Lord', they replied, and the Lord said:</p>

<p id="1"><span class="parno">2</span>'There is, monks, this one way<span class="note" id="n626"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.626] <i>Ekāyano maggo.</i> Sometimes translated 'the only way' or 'the one and only way' with, on occasion, a slightly triumphalist connotation. DA in fact offers a number of possibilities, thus showing that the old commentators were not entirely sure of the exact meaning. Ekāyana can be literally rendered 'one-going', which is ambiguous. Ñāṇamoli has 'a path that goes one way only'. In any case it should not be confused with the term sometimes found in Buddhist Sanskrit ekayāna 'one vehicle' or 'career'.</span></span></span> to the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and distress, for the disappearance of pain and sadness,<span class="note" id="n627"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.627] <i>Domanassa:</i> in this context usually translated ʹgriefʹ, but cf. <a href="dn21.html#2.3">DN 21.2.3</a> where the meaning is closer to 'sadness'.</span></span></span> for the gaining of the right path,<span class="note" id="n628"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.628] <i>Ñāya:</i> 'leading, guiding' (sometimes = ʹlogicʹ). Here = 'the right path'.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p"></span></span></span> for the realisation of Nibbāna: – that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness.<span class="note" id="n629"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.629] <i>Satipaṭṭhānā.</i> It is probably a compound of <i>sati + upaṭṭhāna</i> (lit. 'placing near'), as in the old Sanskrit version (Smṛty-upasthāna Sūtra). 'Foundations', though used by Nyānaponika and others, is really a makeshift translation. In any case, whatever the etymology, the meaning emerges clearly enough from the instructions that follow.Sati (Skt. <i>smṛti</i>) originally meant 'memory' (and still, rarely, does in Pali). The rendering 'mindfulness' by RD was a brilliant one which is almost universally used (though 'recollection' or 'recollectedness' is occasionally found). The use of 'self-possession' by A.K. Warder in his otherwise excellent Indian Buddhism is regrettable. It should perhaps be mentioned that Buddhist Sanskrit smṛti is clearly used in a different sense from the Hindu smṛti 'oral tradition'.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>Contemplation of the Body</h3>
<h4>1. Mindfulness of Breathing</h4>
</div>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>'And how, monks, does a monk abide contemplating the body as body? Here a monk, having gone into the forest, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty place,<span class="note" id="n636"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.636] Or 'an empty room'.</span></span></span> sits down cross-legged, holding his body erect, having established mindfulness before him.<span class="note" id="n637"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.637] I.e. on the breath in front of him, as DA. Nyāṇaponika paraphrases 'keeping…his mindfulness alert'. Readers of F.L. Woodward's somewhat dated Some Sayings of the Buddha should note that there is no basis for his footnote 'Concentrating between the eyebrows'.</span></span></span> Mindfully he breathes in, mindfully he breathes out.<span class="note" id="n638"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.638] This is the probable meaning of assasati, passasati, though it is just possible that the terms should be reversed. Ñāṇamoli's footnote: 'The exercise described is one in mental observation not in bodily development or breath control as in Hatha-yoga' may be a necessary reminder to some.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Breathing in a long breath, he knows that he breathes in a long breath,<span class="note" id="n639"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.639] Lit. 'He knows: "I breathe in a long breath"', etc. Pali regularly uses direct speech in such cases.</span></span></span> and breathing out a long breath, he knows that he breathes out a long breath.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Breathing in a short breath, he knows that he breathes in a short breath, and breathing out a short breath, he knows that he breathes out a short breath.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>He trains himself, thinking: "I will breathe in, conscious of the whole body."<span class="note" id="n640"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.640] This is taken to mean 'the whole body of breath'. "'Making known, making clear to myself the beginning, middle and end of the whole body of breathings in…"' (DA, transl. Soma Thera).</span></span></span> He trains himself, thinking: "I will breathe out, conscious of the whole body."</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>He trains himself, thinking: "I will breathe in, calming the whole bodily process."<span class="note" id="n641"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.641] <i>Kāya-saṅkhāra.</i> This calming process may lead to the development of jhāna, but this is not the primary object here.</span></span></span> He trains himself, thinking: "I will breathe out, calming the whole bodily process."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Just as a skilled turner, or his assistant, in making a long turn, knows that he is making a long turn, or in making a short turn, knows that he is making a short turn, so too a monk, in breathing in a long breath, knows that he breathes in a long breath… and so trains himself, thinking: "I will breathe out, calming the whole bodily process."'</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>'So he abides contemplating body as body internally,<span class="note" id="n642"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.642] Internally means 'one's own body' and externally means 'someone else's body'.</span></span></span> contemplating body as body externally, contemplating body as body both internally and externally. He abides contemplating arising phenomena<span class="note" id="n643"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.643] <i>Samudaya-dhammā.</i> Samudaya is, perhaps significantly, the word used for the 'origin' of suffering in the Second Noble Truth. Awareness of how phenomena (body, etc.) come to be is meant. Ñāṇamoli has 'contemplating the body in its arising factors'.</span></span></span> in the body, he abides contemplating vanishing phenomena<span class="note" id="n644"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.643] <i>Vaya-dhammā:</i> Ñāṇamoli has 'contemplating the body in its vanishing factors'.</span></span></span> in the body, he abides contemplating both arising and vanishing phenomena in the body. Or else, mindfulness that "there is body" is present to him just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness.<span class="note" id="n645"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.645] Just holding the thought in mind without speculating, mind-wandering, etc.</span></span></span> And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. And that, monks, is how a monk abides contemplating body as body.'</p>

<h4>2. The Four Postures</h4>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>'Again, a monk, when walking, knows that he is walking, when standing, knows that he is standing, when sitting, knows that he is sitting, when lying down, knows that he is lying down. In whatever way his body is disposed, he knows that that is how it is.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>'So he abides contemplating body as body internally, externally, and both internally and externally… And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. And that, monks, is how a monk abides contemplating body as body.'</p>

<h4>3. Clear Awareness</h4>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>'Again, a monk, when going forward or back, is clearly aware of what he is doing,<span class="note" id="n646"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.646] <i>Sampajāna-kārī hoti:</i> 'Is acting in a clearly conscious way' (Horner). RD's rendering of 'self-possession' for sampajañña (adopted, even more ridiculously, for sati by Warder breaks down here).</span></span></span> in looking forward or back he is clearly aware of what he is doing, in bending and stretching he is clearly aware of what he is doing, in carrying his inner and outer robe and his bowl he is clearly aware of what he is doing, in eating, drinking, chewing and savouring he is clearly aware of what he is doing, in passing excrement or urine he is clearly aware of what he is doing, in walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep and waking up, in speaking or in staying silent, he is clearly aware of what he is doing.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>'So he abides contemplating body as body internally, externally, and both internally and externally… And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. And that, monks, is how a monk abides contemplating body as body.'</p>

<h4>4. Reflection on the Repulsive: Parts of the Body</h4>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>'Again, a monk reviews<span class="note" id="n647"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.647] <i>Paccavekkhati.</i> The same verb-stem is used in <i>paccavekkhaṇa-ñāṇa</i> 'reviewing-knowledge': see <a href="dn9.html#n213" target="_self">n.213</a>.</span></span></span> this very body from the soles of the feet upwards and from the scalp downwards, enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities: "In this body there are head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin,<span class="note" id="n648"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.648] These first five are given as a standard meditation for novices.</span></span></span> flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, mesentery, bowels, stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, tallow, saliva, snot, synovic fluid, urine.′′<span class="note" id="n649"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.649] With the addition of 'brain' these 32 parts of the body are included as a meditation-subject: cf. VM 8.42ff.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>Just as if there were a bag, open at both ends, full of various kinds of grain such as hill-rice, paddy, green gram,<span class="note" id="n650"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.650] <i>Phaseolus mungo:</i> sometimes sold in the West as 'mung beans'.</span></span></span> kidney-beans, sesame, husked rice, and a man with good eyesight were to open the bag and examine them, saying: "This is hill-rice, this is paddy, this is green gram, these are kidney-beans, this is sesame, this is husked rice", so too a monk reviews this very body: "In this body there are head-hairs,… urine."</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>'So he abides contemplating body as body internally, externally, and both internally and externally…And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. And that, monks, is how a monk abides contemplating body as body.'</p>

<h4>5. The Four Elements</h4>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>'Again, a monk reviews this body, however it may be placed or disposed, in terms of the elements: "There are in this body the earth-element, the water-element, the fire-element, the air-element.′′<span class="note" id="n651"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.651] Cf. <a href="dn1.html#n70">n.70.</a></span></span></span></p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>Just as if a skilled butcher or his assistant, having slaughtered a cow,<span class="note" id="n652"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.652] An unpleasant image, heightened for the modem reader when the hygienic aspect is considered! It shows that there were no 'sacred cows' in the Buddha’s day.</span></span></span> were to sit at a crossroads with the carcass divided into portions, so a monk reviews this very body…in terms of the elements: "There are in this body the earth-element, the water-element, the fire-element, the air-element."</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>'So he abides contemplating body as body internally… And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. And that, monks, is how a monk abides contemplating body as body.'</p>

<h3>Contemplation of Mind-Objects</h3>
<h4>1. The Five Hindrances</h4>

<p id="p57"><span class="parno">57</span>'And how, monks, does a monk abide contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects?′<span class="note" id="n672"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.672] <i>Dhammā</i> (cf. <a href="#n635">n.635</a>). The question is sometimes asked concerning the relation of the four foundations of mindfulness to the schema of the five aggregates <i>(khandhas)</i>. The point is explained here by DA as follows: contemplation of body is concerned with the aggregate of materiality or form <i>(rūpakkhandha)</i>; contemplation of feelings is concerned with the aggregate of feeling <i>(vedanākkhandha)</i>; contemplation of mind is concerned with the aggregate of consciousness <i>(viññāṇa-kkhandha)</i>; and contemplation of mind-objects concerns itself with the aggregates of perception and mental formations <i>(saññā-, saṅkhāra-kkhandha)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

In verse 12 the exercise was simply to note the presence of such a state of mind, if it was present. Here one goes further, and investigates how such a state arises, and how it can be got rid of, etc.</span></span></span> is present in himself, a monk knows that it is present. If sensual desire is absent in himself, a monk knows that it is absent. And he knows how unarisen sensual desire comes to arise, and he knows how the abandonment of arisen sensual desire comes about, and he knows how the non-arising of the abandoned sensual desire in the future will come about.<span class="note" id="n674"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.674] DA lists six methods for getting rid of sensuality: (1) 'Right reflection' on an unpleasing <i>(asubha)</i> object; (2) Developing jhāna, whereby the hindrance is suppressed; (3) Guarding the senses; (4) Moderation in eating; (5) The support of 'good friends' <i>(kalyāṇa-mittatā)</i>; (6) Helpful conversation <i>(sappāyakathā)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p95"><span class="parno">95</span>'And what, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering?

<h5>Truth of the Path Leading to the End of Suffering</h5>

<p id="p119"><span class="parno">119</span>'And what, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Way of Practice Leading to the Cessation of Suffering? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path, namely: — Right View, Right Thought; Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood; Right Effort Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.</p>

<p id="p120"><span class="parno">120</span>'And what, monks, is Right View?<span class="note" id="n708"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.708] <i>Sammā-diṭṭhi.</i> This, or 'Right Seeing' is the literal rendering ('Right Vision' would be an unwise rendering, because liable to be misleading!). Diṭṭhi here is a singular, and denotes 'seeing things as they really are', whereas 'views' in the plural are always wrong. It should be noted that when not prefixed with the word sammā, diṭṭhi means 'speculative opinions', and the like, which are not based on 'seeing things as they really are'. The formal opposite of sammā-diṭṭhi is micchā-diṭṭhi, a term generally reserved for especially pernicious views (cf. <a href="dn12.html#n245">n.245</a>). Sammā-diṭṭhi and the rest are sometimes rendered 'Perfect View', and so on, but this only refers to the supramundane path as described in <a href="../mn/mn117.html">MN&nbsp;117</a>.</span></span></span> It is, monks, the knowledge of suffering, the knowledge of the origin of suffering, the knowledge of the cessation of suffering, and the knowledge of the way of practice leading to the cessation of suffering. This is called Right View.</p>

<p id="p121"><span class="parno">121</span>'And what, monks, is Right Thought?<span class="note" id="n709"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.709] <i>Sammā-saṅkappa:</i> variously rendered as 'right aspiration, right motive', etc.</span></span></span> The thought of renunciation, the thought of non-ill-will, the thought of harmlessness. This, monks, is called Right Thought.</p>

<p id="p122"><span class="parno">122</span>'And what, monks, is Right Speech? Refraining from lying, refraining from slander, refraining from harsh speech, refraining from frivolous speech. This is called Right Speech.</p>

<p id="p123"><span class="parno">123</span>'And what, monks, is Right Action? Refraining from taking life, refraining from taking what is not given, refraining from sexual misconduct. This is called Right Action.</p>

<p id="p124"><span class="parno">124</span>'And what, monks, is Right Livelihood? Here, monks, the Ariyan disciple, having given up wrong livelihood, keeps himself by right livelihood.</p>

<p id="p125"><span class="parno">125</span>'And what, monks, is Right Effort? Here, monks, a monk rouses his will, makes an effort, stirs up energy, exerts his mind and strives to prevent the arising of unarisen evil unwholesome mental states. He rouses his will… and strives to overcome evil unwholesome mental states that have arisen. He rouses his will… and strives to produce unarisen wholesome mental states. He rouses his will, makes an effort, stirs up energy, exerts his mind and strives to maintain wholesome mental states that have arisen, not to let them fade away, to bring them to greater growth, to the full perfection of development. This is called Right Effort.</p>

<p id="p126"><span class="parno">126</span>'And what, monks, is Right Mindfulness? Here, monks, a monk abides contemplating body as body, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world; he abides contemplating feelings as feelings…; he abides contemplating mind as mind…; he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world. This is called Right Mindfulness.</p>

<p id="p127"><span class="parno">127</span>'And what, monks, is Right Concentration? Here, a monk, detached from sense-desires, detached from unwholesome mental states, enters and remains in the first jhāna, which is with thinking and pondering, born of detachment, filled with delight and joy. And with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he enters and remains in the second jhāna, which is without thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and joy. And with the fading away of delight, remaining imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experiences in himself the joy of which the Noble Ones say: "Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness", he enters the third jhāna. And, having given up pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna, which is beyond pleasure and pain, and purified by equanimity and mindfulness. This is called Right Concentration. And that, monks, is called the way of practice leading to the cessation of suffering.'</p>

<p id="p128"><span class="parno">128</span>'So he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects internally, contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects externally, contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects both internally and externally. He abides contemplating arising phenomena in mind-objects, he abides contemplating vanishing-phenomena in mind-objects, he abides contemplating both arising and vanishing phenomena in mind-objects. Or else, mindfulness that "there are mind-objects" is present just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness. And he abides detached, not grasping at anything in the world. And that, monks, is how a monk abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects in respect of the Four Noble Truths.'</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p id="p129"><span class="parno">129</span>'Whoever, monks, should practise these four foundations of mindfulness for just seven years may expect one of two results: either Arahantship in this life or, if there should be some substrate left, the state of a Non-Returner.</p>

<p id="p132"><span class="parno">132</span>'It was said: "There is, monks, this one way to the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and distress, for the disappearance of pain and sadness, for the gaining of the right path, for the realisation of Nibbāna: — that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness", and it is for this reason that it was said.'</p>
