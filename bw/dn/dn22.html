<div lang="en">
<p><span class="parno">1</span><span>So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants!”</p>

<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>What four? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of the mind — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of principles — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>

<h2>1. Observing the Body </h2>
<p><strong>1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing </strong></p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body?</p>

<hr>

<p>It’s when a mendicant — gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut — sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and focuses their mindfulness right there. Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body.</p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body’s motion.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<p>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1.2. The Postures </strong></p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’ When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’ Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.</p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<p>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1.3. Situational Awareness </strong></p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl, and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.</p>

<p>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1.4. Focusing on the Repulsive  </strong></p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’</p>

<p>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1.5. Focusing on the Elements  </strong></p>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements: ‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>1.6. The Charnel Ground Contemplations </strong></p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span>Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ </p>

<p>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">22</span>Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<p><span class="parno">23</span>Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews …</p>

<p><span class="parno">24</span>A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews …</p>

<p><span class="parno">25</span>A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews …</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">26</span>Bones without sinews, scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull …</p>

<p><span class="parno">27</span>White bones, the color of shells …</p>

<p><span class="parno">28</span>Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile …</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">29</span>Bones rotted and crumbled to powder. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’ </p>

<p>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<hr>

<p>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<h2>2. Observing the Feelings </h2>

<p><span class="parno">30</span>And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of feelings?</p>

<p>It’s when a mendicant who feels a pleasant feeling knows: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">31</span>When they feel a painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">32</span>When they feel a neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a neutral feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">33</span>When they feel a material pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material pleasant feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">34</span>When they feel a spiritual pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual pleasant feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">35</span>When they feel a material painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material painful feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">36</span>When they feel a spiritual painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual painful feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">37</span>When they feel a material neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material neutral feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">38</span>When they feel a spiritual neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual neutral feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">39</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of feelings internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing feelings as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that feelings exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<p>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings.</p>

<h2>3. Observing the Mind </h2>

<p><span class="parno">40-41</span>And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the mind?</p>

<p>It’s when a mendicant knows mind with greed as ‘mind with greed,’ and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">42-43</span>They know mind with hate as ‘mind with hate,’ and mind without hate as ‘mind without hate.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">44-45</span>They know mind with delusion as ‘mind with delusion,’ and mind without delusion as ‘mind without delusion.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">46-47</span>They know constricted mind as ‘constricted mind,’ and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">48-49</span>They know expansive mind as ‘expansive mind,’ and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">50-51</span>They know mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme,’ and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">52-53</span>They know mind immersed in meditation as ‘mind immersed in meditation,’ and mind not immersed in meditation as ‘mind not immersed in meditation.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">54-55</span>They know freed mind as ‘freed mind,’ and unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind.’</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">56</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the mind as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the mind exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<p>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the mind.</p>

<h2>4. Observing Principles </h2>

<p>It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances. And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances?</p>

<p><span class="parno">58</span>It’s when a mendicant who has sensual desire in them understands: ‘I have sensual desire in me.’ When they don’t have sensual desire in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have sensual desire in me.’ They understand how sensual desire arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.</p>

<p><span class="parno">59</span>When they have ill will in them, they understand: ‘I have ill will in me.’ When they don’t have ill will in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have ill will in me.’ They understand how ill will arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.</p>

<p>It’s when a mendicant contemplates: Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling. Such is perception, such is the origin of perception, such is the ending of perception. Such are choices, such is the origin of choices, such is the ending of choices.

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">71</span>They understand the mind, thoughts, and the fetter that arises dependent on both of these. They understand how the fetter that has not arisen comes to arise; how the arisen fetter comes to be abandoned; and how the abandoned fetter comes to not rise again in the future.</p>

<p><span class="parno">72</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally …<br>

<br>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the six internal and external sense fields.</p>


<h3>4.4. The Awakening Factors </h3>

<p><span class="parno">73</span>Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the seven awakening factors. And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the seven awakening factors?</p>

<hr>

<p>It’s when a mendicant who has the awakening factor of mindfulness in them understands: ‘I have the awakening factor of mindfulness in me.’ When they don’t have the awakening factor of mindfulness in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have the awakening factor of mindfulness in me.’ They understand how the awakening factor of mindfulness that has not arisen comes to arise; and how the awakening factor of mindfulness that has arisen becomes fulfilled by development.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">74-79</span>When they have the awakening factor of investigation of principles … energy … rapture … tranquility … immersion … equanimity in them, they understand: ‘I have the awakening factor of equanimity in me.’ When they don’t have the awakening factor of equanimity in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have the awakening factor of equanimity in me.’ They understand how the awakening factor of equanimity that has not arisen comes to arise; and how the awakening factor of equanimity that has arisen becomes fulfilled by development.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">80</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<p>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the seven awakening factors.</p>


<h3>4.5. The Truths </h3>

<p><span class="parno">81</span>Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths. And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths?</p>

<p>It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’</p>

<p>The first recitation section is finished.</p>

<h4>4.5.1. The Truth of Suffering </h4>


<p><span class="parno">82</span>And what is the noble truth of suffering?</p>

<p>Rebirth is suffering; old age is suffering; death is suffering; sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress are suffering; association with the disliked is suffering; separation from the liked is suffering; not getting what you wish for is suffering. In brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering.</p>

<p><span class="parno">83</span>And what is rebirth? The rebirth, inception, conception, reincarnation, manifestation of the sets of phenomena, and acquisition of the sense fields of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called rebirth.</p>

<p><span class="parno">84</span>And what is old age? The old age, decrepitude, broken teeth, grey hair, wrinkly skin, diminished vitality, and failing faculties of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called old age.</p>

<p><span class="parno">85</span>And what is death? The passing away, perishing, disintegration, demise, mortality, death, decease, breaking up of the aggregates, laying to rest of the corpse, and cutting off of the life faculty of the various sentient beings in the various orders of sentient beings. This is called death.</p>

<p><span class="parno">86</span>And what is sorrow? The sorrow, sorrowing, state of sorrow, inner sorrow, inner deep sorrow in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering. This is called sorrow.</p>

<p><span class="parno">87</span>And what is lamentation? The wail, lament, wailing, lamenting, state of wailing and lamentation in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering. This is called lamentation.</p>

<p><span class="parno">88</span>And what is pain? Physical pain, physical displeasure, the painful, unpleasant feeling that’s born from physical contact. This is called pain.</p>

<p><span class="parno">89</span>And what is sadness? Mental pain, mental displeasure, the painful, unpleasant feeling that’s born from mental contact. This is called sadness.</p>

<p><span class="parno">90</span>And what is distress? The stress, distress, state of stress and distress in someone who has undergone misfortune, who has experienced suffering. This is called distress.</p>

<p><span class="parno">91</span>And what is meant by ‘association with the disliked is suffering’? There are sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts that are unlikable, undesirable, and disagreeable. And there are those who want to harm, injure, disturb, and threaten you. The coming together with these, the joining, inclusion, mixing with them: this is what is meant by ‘association with the disliked is suffering’.</p>

<p><span class="parno">92</span>And what is meant by ‘separation from the liked is suffering’? There are sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts that are likable, desirable, and agreeable. And there are those who want to benefit, help, comfort, and protect you. The division from these, the disconnection, segregation, and parting from them: this is what is meant by ‘separation from the liked is suffering’.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">93</span>And what is meant by ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering’? In sentient beings who are liable to be reborn, such a wish arises: ‘Oh, if only we were not liable to be reborn! If only rebirth would not come to us!’ But you can’t get that by wishing. This is what is meant by ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering.’ In sentient beings who are liable to grow old … fall ill … die … experience sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress, such a wish arises: ‘Oh, if only we were not liable to experience sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress! If only sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress would not come to us!’ But you can’t get that by wishing. This is what is meant by ‘not getting what you wish for is suffering.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">94</span>And what is meant by ‘in brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering’? They are the grasping aggregates that consist of form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. This is what is meant by ‘in brief, the five grasping aggregates are suffering’.</p>

<p>This is called the noble truth of suffering.</p>

<h4>4.5.2. The Origin of Suffering </h4>


<p><span class="parno">95</span>And what is the noble truth of the origin of suffering?</p>

<p>It’s the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, looking for enjoyment in various different realms. That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for continued existence, and craving to end existence.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">96</span>But where does that craving arise and where does it settle? Whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant, it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p><span class="parno">97</span>And what in the world seems nice and pleasant? The eye in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles. The ear … nose … tongue … body … mind in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p><span class="parno">98</span>Sights … sounds … smells … tastes … touches … thoughts in the world seem nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p><span class="parno">99</span>Eye consciousness … ear consciousness … nose consciousness … tongue consciousness … body consciousness … mind consciousness in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p><span class="parno">100</span>Eye contact … ear contact … nose contact … tongue contact … body contact … mind contact in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p><span class="parno">101</span>Feeling born of eye contact … feeling born of ear contact … feeling born of nose contact … feeling born of tongue contact … feeling born of body contact … feeling born of mind contact in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p><span class="parno">102</span>Perception of sights … perception of sounds … perception of smells … perception of tastes … perception of touches … perception of thoughts in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p><span class="parno">103</span>Intention regarding sights … intention regarding sounds … intention regarding smells … intention regarding tastes … intention regarding touches … intention regarding thoughts in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p><span class="parno">104</span>Craving for sights … craving for sounds … craving for smells … craving for tastes … craving for touches … craving for thoughts in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p><span class="parno">105</span>Thoughts about sights … thoughts about sounds … thoughts about smells … thoughts about tastes … thoughts about touches … thoughts about thoughts in the world seem nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p><span class="parno">106</span>Considerations regarding sights … considerations regarding sounds … considerations regarding smells … considerations regarding tastes … considerations regarding touches … considerations regarding thoughts in the world seem nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving arises and settles.</p>

<p>This is called the noble truth of the origin of suffering.</p>

<h4>4.5.3. The Cessation of Suffering </h4>


<p><span class="parno">107</span>And what is the noble truth of the cessation of suffering? It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">108-118</span>Whatever in the world seems nice and pleasant, it is there that craving is given up and ceases.<br>

<br>And what in the world seems nice and pleasant? The eye in the world seems nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving is given up and ceases. …<br>

<br>Considerations regarding thoughts in the world seem nice and pleasant, and it is there that craving is given up and ceases.<br>

<br>This is called the noble truth of the cessation of suffering.</p>

<h4>4.5.4. The Path </h4>


<p><span class="parno">119</span>And what is the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering?</p>

<p>It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>

<p><span class="parno">120</span>And what is right view? Knowing about suffering, the origin of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering. This is called right view.</p>

<p><span class="parno">121</span>And what is right thought? Thoughts of renunciation, good will, and harmlessness. This is called right thought.</p>

<p><span class="parno">122</span>And what is right speech? The refraining from lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, and talking nonsense. This is called right speech.</p>

<p><span class="parno">123</span>And what is right action? Refraining from killing living creatures, stealing, and sexual misconduct. This is called right action.</p>

<p><span class="parno">124</span>And what is right livelihood? It’s when a noble disciple gives up wrong livelihood and earns a living by right livelihood. This is called right livelihood.</p>

<p><span class="parno">125</span>And what is right effort? It’s when a mendicant generates enthusiasm, tries, makes an effort, exerts the mind, and strives so that bad, unskillful qualities don’t arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that bad, unskillful qualities that have arisen are given up. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities arise. They generate enthusiasm, try, make an effort, exert the mind, and strive so that skillful qualities that have arisen remain, are not lost, but increase, mature, and are completed by development. This is called right effort.</p>

<p><span class="parno">126</span>And what is right mindfulness? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of the mind — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of principles — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. This is called right mindfulness.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">127</span>And what is right immersion? It’s when a mendicant, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. As the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, they enter and remain in the second absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of immersion, with internal clarity and confidence, and unified mind, without placing the mind and keeping it connected. And with the fading away of rapture, they enter and remain in the third absorption, where they meditate with equanimity, mindful and aware, personally experiencing the bliss of which the noble ones declare, ‘Equanimous and mindful, one meditates in bliss.’ Giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, they enter and remain in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. This is called right immersion.</p>

<p>This is called the noble truth of the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">128</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<hr>

<p>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">129</span>Anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven years can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.</p>

<p><span class="parno">130-131</span>Let alone seven years, anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for six years … five years … four years … three years … two years … one year … seven months … six months … five months … four months … three months … two months … one month … a fortnight … Let alone a fortnight, anyone who develops these four kinds of mindfulness meditation in this way for seven days can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.</p>

<p><span class="parno">132</span>‘The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.’ That’s what I said, and this is why I said it.”</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">133</span>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.</p>
