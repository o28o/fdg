<h3>The Wanderer Nigrodha</h3>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. Once the Lord was staying in Rājagaha at the Vultures' Peak. And at that time the wanderer Nigrodha<span class="note" id="n759"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.759] His name means 'Banyan' . Cf. DN 8.23.</span></span></span> was staying at the Udumbarikā lodging<span class="note" id="n760"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.760] A park given by Queen Udumbarikā for wanderers, similar to that mentioned at <a href="dn24.html#n746">n.746</a>.</span></span></span> for wanderers, with a large company of some three thousand wanderers. And one morning early, the householder Sandhana came to Rājagaha in order to see the Lord. Then he thought: 'It is not the proper time to see the Blessed Lord, he is in retreat; it is not the proper time to see the meditating monks, they are in retreat. Perhaps I should go to the Udumbarikā lodging for wanderers and call on Nigrodha.' And he did so.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>And just then Nigrodha was sitting in the midst of a large crowd of wanderers who were all shouting and screaming and making a great clamour, and indulging in various kinds of unedifying conversation<span class="note" id="n761"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.761] Cf. DN 1.1.17, and DN 9.3.</span></span></span> about kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, war, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns and cities, countries, women, heroes, street- and well-gossip, talk of the departed, desultory chat, speculation about land and sea, talk of being and non-being.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then Nigrodha saw Sandhāna approaching from a distance, and he called his followers to order, saying: 'Be quiet, gentlemen, don't make a noise, gentlemen! The householder Sandhāna, a follower of the ascetic Gotama, is approaching. He is one of the number of white-robed householder followers of the ascetic Gotama in Rājagaha. And these good folk are fond of quiet, they are taught to be quiet and speak in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us.' At this the wanderers fell silent.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then Sandhāna approached Nigrodha and exchanged courtesies with him, and then sat down to one side. Then he said: 'Reverend sirs, the way the wanderers of another faith conduct themselves when they come together is one thing: they make a great clamour and indulge in all manner of unedifying conversation…The Blessed Lord's way is different : he seeks a lodging in the forest, in the depths of the jungle, free from noise, with little sound, far from the madding crowd, undisturbed by men, well fitted for seclusion.'</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then Nigrodha replied: 'Well now, householder, do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks to? Whom does he converse with? From whom does he get his lucidity of wisdom? The ascetic Gotama's wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life, he is unused to assemblies, he is no good at conversation, he is right out of touch. Just as bison<span class="note" id="n762"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.762] <i>Go-kaṇṇa.</i> Dictionaries give 'a large species of deer', for which 'bison' seems to be the correct rendering; RD, following DA, has 'a one-eyed cow'.</span></span></span> circling around keep to the fringes, so it is with the ascetic Gotama. In fact, householder, if the ascetic Gotama were to come to this assembly, we would baffle him with a single question, we would knock him over like an empty pot.'</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Now the Lord, with his divine-ear-faculty, purified and surpassing human raṅge, heard this exchange between Sandhāna and Nigrodha. And, descending from the Vultures' Peak, he came to the Peacocks' Feeding Ground beside the Sumāgadha Tank, and walked up and down there in the open air. Then Nigrodha caught sight of him, and he called his company to order, saying: 'Gentlemen, he quiet, be less noisy! The ascetic Gotama is walking up and down beside the Sumāgadha Tank. He is fond of quiet, he speaks in praise of quiet. If he sees that this company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us. If he does so, we will put this question to him: "Lord, what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?"' At this, the wanderers were silent.</p>

<h3>Extreme Austerity</h3>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then the Lord approached Nigrodha, and Nigrodha said: 'Come, Blessed Lord, welcome, Blessed Lord! At last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his way to come here. Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.' The Lord sat down on the prepared seat, and Nigrodha took a low stool and sat down to one side. Then the Lord said to him: 'Nigrodha, what was the subject of your conversation just now? What talk have I interrupted?' Nigrodha replied: 'Lord, we saw the Blessed Lord walking up and down at the Peacocks' Feeding Ground by the Sumāgadhā Tank, and we thought: "If the ascetic Gotama were to come here we could ask him this question: Lord, what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?"'</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>'Nigrodha, it is hard for you, holding different views, being of different inclinations and subject to different influences, following a different teacher, to understand the doctrine which I teach my disciples… Come on then, Nigrodha, ask me about your own teaching, about your extreme austerity. How are the conditions of austerity and self-mortification fulfilled, and how are they not fulfilled?'</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise, exclaiming: 'It is wonderful, it is marvellous how great are the powers of the ascetic Gotama in holding back with his own theories and in inviting others to discuss theirs!'</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>Silencing them, Nigrodha said: 'Lord, we teach the higher austerities, we regard them as essential, we adhere to them. Such being the case, what constitutes their fulfilment or non-fulfilment? '</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>'Suppose, Nigrodha, a self-mortifier goes naked, uses no polite restraints,<span class="note" id="a"><span class="details"><span class="p">In regard to bodily functions (DA). The whole list recurs, e.g. at <a href="../mn/mn12.html#p42">MN&nbsp;12</a>–45.</span></span></span> licks his hands, does not come or stand still when requested. He does not accept food offered or prepared for him, or an invitation to a meal. He does not accept food out of the pot or pan, nor on the threshold, among the firewood or the rice-pounders, nor where two people are eating, from a pregnant or nursing woman or from one living with a man, nor from gleanings, from where a dog is standing or where flies are swarming. He eats no fish or meat and drinks no rum or spirits or fermented rice-gruel.<span class="note" id="b"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i>Thusodakaṁ:</i> 'rice-gruel', but the sense requires something fermented. RD's assertion to the contrary is not supported by the Sub-Commentary. Ñāṇamoli, at MN&nbsp;12.45, renders it 'besotting drink'.</span></span></span> He is a one-house man<span class="note" id="c"><span class="details"><span class="p">One who accepts alms from only one house.</span></span></span> or a one-piece man,<span class="note" id="d"><span class="details"><span class="p">One who takes only one portion.</span></span></span> a two-house man, a seven-piece man or a seven-house man. He exists on one, two or seven little offerings, eats only once a day, once in two days, once in seven days. He takes to eating rice only twice a month. These are considered proper practices.</p>

<hr>
<p>'Or a man becomes a herb-eater, a millet-eater, a raw-rice-eater, a wild-rice-eater, an eater of water-plants, of rice-husk-powder, of rice-scum, of the flowers of oil-seeds, grass or cow-dung, of forest roots and fruits, eating windfalls</p>

<p>He wears coarse hemp or mixed material, shrouds from corpses, rags from the dust-heap … He is a plucker-out of hair and beard, devoted to this practice; he is a covered-thorn man, making his bed on them, sleeping alone in a garment of wet mud, living in the open air, accepting whatever seat is offered, one who drinks no water and is addicted to the practice, or he dwells intent on the practice of going to bathe three times before evening. What do you think, Nigrodha, is the higher austerity thereby fulfilled, or not?' 'Indeed, Lord, it is fulfilled.' 'But, Nigrodha, I maintain that this higher austerity can be faulted in various ways.'</p>

<h4>Defilement</h4>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>'In what way, Lord, do you maintain that it can be faulted?'</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>'Take the case, Nigrodha, of a self-mortifier who practises a certain austerity. As a result, he is pleased and satisfied at having attained his end. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>Or else in so doing he elevates himself and disparages others. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. .</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Or else he has become intoxicated with conceit, infatuated and therefore careless. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>'Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity, and this brings him gains, honours and fame. As a result, he is pleased and satisfied at having attained his end …</p>

<hr>
<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>Or else he elevates himself and disparages others …</p>

<hr>
<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>Or else he becomes intoxicated with conceit, infatuated and therefore careless. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity, and he divides his food into two heaps, saying: "This suits me, that doesn't suit me!" And what does not suit him he eagerly rejects, while what suits him he eats up greedily, recklessly and passionately, not seeing the peril, with no thought for the consequences. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity for the sake of gains, honours and fame, thinking: "Kings and their ministers will honour me, Khattiyas and Brahmins and householders, and religious teachers." And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>'Again, a self-mortifier disparages some ascetic or Brahmin, saying: "See how he lives in abundance, eating all sorts of things! Whether propagated from roots, from stems, from joings, from cuttings or fifthly from seeds,<span class="note" id="e"><span class="details"><span class="p">As at DN 1.1.11.</span></span></span> he chews them all up with that thunderbolt of a jaw of his, and they call him an ascetic!" And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>Or he sees another ascetic or Brahmin being made much of by families, being honoured and respected and worshipped, and he thinks: "They make much of that rich-liver, they honour him, respect him and worship him, whereas I who am a real ascetic and self-mortifier get no such treatment!" Thus he is envious and jealous because of those householders. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>'Again, a self-mortifier sits in a prominent position. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>Or he goes round ostentatiously<span class="note" id="n764"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.764] <i>Adassayamāno:</i> rendered by RD as 'furtively' ('not showing himself'), but DA considers the seemingly negative prefix a- 'a mere particle'. The Sub-Commentary declares that ādassamāno ('showing off') is the meaning. It makes little real difference, since either direct ostentation or mock-humility is intended.</span></span></span> among the families, as if to say: "See, this is my way of renunciation!" And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>Or he behaves in an underhand way. On being asked: "Do you approve of this?" although he does not approve he says: "I do", or although he does approve he says: "I do not." In this way he becomes a conscious liar. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>'Again, a self-mortifier, when the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his assent, withholds that assent. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>Or he is angry and bad-tempered. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>Or he is mean and spiteful, envious and jealous, crafty and deceitful, obstinate and proud, with evil desires and under their sway, with wrong views and given to extremist opinions; he is tainted with worldliness, holding on firmly, unwilling to give up. And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>What do you think, Nigrodha? Are these things faults in the higher austerity, or not?' 'Certainly they are, Lord. It could happen that a single self-mortifier was possessed of all these faults, not to speak of just one or the other.'</p>

<h4>Becoming Pure</h4>

<p><span class="parno">30–42</span>'Now, Nigrodha, take the case of a certain self-mortifier who practises a certain austerity. As a result, he is not pleased and satisfied at having attained his end. This being so, Thus he does not become a conscious liar. In this respect he is purified.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>'Again, a self-mortifier, when the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his assent, gives his assent. In this respect he is purified.</p>

<p id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>And he is not angry or bad-tempered. In this respect he is purified.</p>

<p id="p45"><span class="parno">45</span>And he is not mean and spiteful, envious and jealous, crafty and deceitful, obstinate and proud, he is without evil desires and not under their sway, without wrong views and not given to extremist opinions, he is not tainted with worldliness, does not hold on firmly and is not unwilling to give up. In this respect he is purified.</p>

<p id="p46"><span class="parno">46</span>What do you think, Nigrodha? Is the higher austerity purified by these things, or not?' 'Certainly it is, Lord, it attains its peak there, penetrating to the pith.' 'No, Nigrodha, it does not attain its peak there, penetrating to the pith. It has only reached the outer bark.'<span class="note" id="n765"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.765] For a fuller treatment of the pith-image, see <a href="../mn/mn18.html">MN&nbsp;18</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<h4>The Peak of Purity</h4>

<p id="p47"><span class="parno">47</span>'Well then, Lord, how does austerity attain its peak, penetrating to the pith? It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak, to penetrate to the pith.'</p>

<p id="p48"><span class="parno">48</span>'Nigrodha, take the case of a self-mortifier who observes the fourfold restraint. And what is this? Here, a self-mortifier does not harm a living being, does not cause a living being to be harmed, does not approve of such harming; he does not take what is not given, or cause it to be taken, or approve of such taking; he does not tell a lie, or cause a lie to be told, or approve of such lying; he does not crave for sense-pleasures,<span class="note" id="n766"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.766] Or: 'remain satisfied with what has been achieved.'</span></span></span> cause others to do so, or approve of such craving. In this way, a self-mortifier observes the fourfold restraint.</p>

<h3>The Peak of Purity</h3>

<p id="p55"><span class="parno">55</span>'Well then, Lord, how does austerity reach its peak, penetrating to the pith? It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak, to penetrate to the pith.'</p>

<p id="p56"><span class="parno">56</span>'Well, Nigrodha, take the case of a self-mortifier who observes the fourfold restraint…, free from hatred and ill-will… Thus he remembers various past lives, their conditions and details. And then, with the purified divine eye, he sees beings passing away and arising: base and noble, well favoured and ill-favoured, to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p57"><span class="parno">57</span>What do you think, Nigrodha? Is the higher austerity purified by these things, or not?' 'Certainly it is, Lord. It attains its peak there, penetrating to the pith.'<span class="note" id="n774"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.774] This is the stage reached at DN 2.97, though the wording is slightly discrepant.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p58"><span class="parno">58</span>'So indeed it is, Nigrodha, that austerity is so purified as to reach its peak and penetrate to the pith. And so, Nigrodha, when you ask: "What, Lord, is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?" I say that it is by something more far-reaching and excellent that I train them, through which they…recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life.'</p>

<p id="p59"><span class="parno">59</span>At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise, exclaiming: 'We and our teacher are ruined! We know of nothing higher or more far-reaching than our teaching!'</p>

<h3>Nigrodha is Bewildered</h3>

<p id="p60"><span class="parno">60</span>And when the householder Sandhāna realised: 'These wanderers of other views are actually listening and attending to the Lord's words, and inclining their minds to the higher wisdom, he said to Nigrodha: 'Reverend Nigrodha, you said to me: "Come now, householder, do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks to? … His wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life, he is no good at conversation, he is right out of touch…" So now that the Blessed Lord has come here, why don't you baffle him with a single question and knock him over like an empty pot?' And at these words Nigrodha was silent and upset, his shoulders drooped, he hung his head and sat there downcast and bewildered.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p61"><span class="parno">61</span>Seeing the state he was in, the Lord said: 'Is it true, Nigrodha, that you said that?' 'Lord, it is true that I said that, foolishly, mistakenly, and wickedly.' 'What do you think, Nigrodha? Have you ever heard it said by wanderers who were aged, venerable, the teachers of teachers, that those who in the past were Arahants, fully-enlightened Buddhas used to talk, when they came together, by shouting and screaming and making a great clamour, and indulging in unedifying conversation … the way you and your teachers do? Or did they not say rather that those Blessed Ones sought lodging in the forest, in the depths of the jungle, free from noise, with little sound, far from the madding crowd, undisturbed by men, well-fitted for seclusion, just as I do now?'</p>

<hr>
<p id="p62"><span class="parno">62</span>'Lord, I have heard it said that those who were Arahants, fully-enlightened Buddhas did not indulge in loud talk … but sought lodging in the forest, … just as the Blessed Lord does now.'</p>

<hr>
<p id="p63"><span class="parno">63</span>'Nigrodha, you are an intelligent man of mature years. Did it never occur to you to think: "The Blessed Lord is enlightened and teaches a doctrine of enlightenment, he is self-restrained and teaches a doctrine of self-restraint, he is calm and teaches a doctrine of calm. He has gone beyond and teaches a doctrine of going beyond, he has gained Nibbāna and teaches a doctrine for the gaining of Nibbāna"?'</p>

<h3>Perfecting the Holy Life</h3>

<p id="p64"><span class="parno">64</span>At this, Nigrodha said to the Lord: 'Transgression overcame me, Lord! Foolish, blind and evil as I was, that I spoke thus of the Lord. May the Lord accept my confession of this fault, that I may restrain myself in future!'<span class="note" id="n775"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.775] Cf. DN 2.99ff.</span></span></span> 'Indeed, Nigrodha, transgression overcame you when, through folly, blindness and evil you spoke thus of me. But since you recognise the nature of your transgression and make amends as is right, we accept your confession. For, Nigrodha, it is a mark of progress in the discipline of the Noble Ones, if anyone recognises the nature of his transgression and makes amends as is right, restraining himself for the future.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p65"><span class="parno">65</span>'But, Nigrodha, I tell you this: Let an intelligent man come to me who is sincere, honest and straightforward, and I will instruct him, I will teach him Dhamma. If he practises what he is taught, then within seven years he will attain in this life to that unequalled holy life and goal, for the sake of which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness, by his own knowledge and realisation, and he will abide therein. Let alone seven years — in six years, five, four, three, two years, one year, … seven months, six months, five, four, three, two months, one month, half a month. Let alone half a month — in seven days he can gain that goal.<span class="note" id="n776"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.776] As at <a href="dn22.html#p130">DN 22.130.</a></span></span></span></p>

<h3>Thoughts to be Abandoned</h3>

<p id="p66"><span class="parno">66</span>'Nigrodha, you may think: "The ascetic Gotama says this in order to get disciples." But you should not regard it like that. Let him who is your teacher remain your teacher.<span class="note" id="n777"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.777] The extreme tolerance of Buddhism is shown here. This can be quoted to those who, wishing to practise, e.g. Buddhist meditation, are worried about their prior allegiance to another faith. But see DN 29.4.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p67"><span class="parno">67</span>Or you may think: "He wants us to abandon our rules." But you should not regard it like that. Let your rules remain as they are.</p>

<p id="p68"><span class="parno">68</span>Or you may think: "He wants us to abandon our way of life." But you should not regard it like that. Let your way of life remain as it was.</p>

<p id="p69"><span class="parno">69</span>Or you may think: "He wants to establish us in the doing of things that according to our teaching are wrong, and are so considered among us." But you should not regard it like that. Let those things you consider wrong continue to be so considered.</p>

<p id="p70"><span class="parno">70</span>Or you may think: "He wants to draw us away from things that according to our teaching are good, and are so considered among us." But you should not regard it like that. Let whatever you consider right continue to be so considered. Nigrodha, I do not speak for any of these reasons …</p>

<p id="p71"><span class="parno">71</span>'There are, Nigrodha, unwholesome things that have not been abandoned, tainted, conducive to rebirth,<span class="note" id="n778"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.778] <i>Ponobhavika:</i> as at DN 22.19 and <a href="dn22.html#n702">n.702</a> there.</span></span></span> fearful, productive of painful results in the future, associated with birth, decay and death. It is for the abandonment of these things that I teach Dhamma. If you practise accordingly, these tainted things will be abandoned, and the things that make for purification will develop and grow, and you will all attain to and dwell, in this very life, by your own insight and realisation, in the fullness of perfected wisdom.'</p>

<p id="p72"><span class="parno">72</span>At these words the wanderers sat silent and upset, their shoulders drooped, they hung their heads and sat there downcast and bewildered, so possessed were their minds by Māra.<span class="note" id="n779"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.779] Like Ananda at DN 16.34ff.</span></span></span> Then the Lord said: 'Every one of these foolish men is possessed by the evil one, so that not a single one of them thinks: "Let us now follow the holy life proclaimed by the ascetic Gotama, that we may learn it — for what do seven days matter?"'</p>

<p id="p73"><span class="parno">73</span>Then the Lord, having uttered his lion's roar in the Udumbarika park, rose up in the air and alighted on the Vultures' Peak. And the householder Sandhāna also returned to Rājagaha.<span class="note" id="n780"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.780] DN says that the Buddha’s words, though not successful at the time, were of benefit to the wanderers in the future.</span></span></span></p>
