<section class="raw_sutta">  <!-- English and Pali -->
<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n810"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.810] This is a parallel fable to the previous Sutta, giving a slightly different account of 'origins', and including a devastating attack on the pretensions of the Brahmins. It has close links with Sutta 3, and RD refers to it in some detail in the introduction to that Sutta. He calls it a kind of Buddhist book of Genesis, which is fair enough if one pays attention to the differences. Here there is no creator god, and though we start (at verse 10) with something like the same state 'in the beginning', this is of course no absolute beginning but one of the eternally recurring 'fresh starts' in saṁsāra.</span></span></span> Once the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī, at the mansion of Migara's mother<span class="note" id="n811"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.811] She was called Visākhā, and her 'mansion' was a comparatively splendid structure, though still small to the modern way of thinking.</span></span></span> in the East Park. And at that time Vasettha and Bhāradvāja<span class="note" id="n812"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.812] See also DN 13.3.</span></span></span> were living among the monks, hoping to become monks themselves. And in the evening, the Lord rose from his secluded meditation and came out of the mansion, and started walking up and down in its shade.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Vasettha noticed this, and he said to Bhāradvāja: 'Friend Bharadvaja, the Lord has come out and is walking up and down. Let us approach him. We might be fortunate enough to hear a talk on Dhamma from the Lord himself.' 'Yes, indeed', said Bharadvaja, ..</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>So they went up to the Lord, saluted him, and fell into step with him.</p>

<p>Then the Lord said to Vasettha: 'Vāseṭṭha,<span class="note" id="n813"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.813] Or Vāseṭṭhā (vocative plural) with some manuscripts, as a way of addressing the two.</span></span></span> you two are Brahmins born and bred, and you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness from Brahmin families. Do not the Brahmins revile and abuse you?' 'Indeed, Lord, the Brahmins do revile and abuse us. They don't hold back with their usual flood of reproaches.' 'Well, Vasettha, what kind of reproaches do they fling at you?' 'Lord, what the Brahmins say is this: "The Brahmin caste<span class="note" id="n814"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.814] Cf. DN 3.1.14, and also <a href="../mn/mn84.html">MN&nbsp;84</a> and <a href="../mn/mn93.html">93.</a></span></span></span> is the highest caste, other castes are base; the Brahmin caste is fair, other castes are dark; Brahmins are purified, non-Brahmins are not, the Brahmins are the true children of Brahmā,<span class="note" id="n815"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.815] They are of course priests of Brahmā.</span></span></span> born from his mouth, born of Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of Brahma. And you, you have deserted the highest class and gone over to the base class of shaveling petty ascetics, servants, dark fellows born of Brahmā's foot!<span class="note" id="n816"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.816] DN 3.1.14.</span></span></span> It's not right, it's not proper for you to mix with such people!" That is the way the Brahmins abuse us, Lord.'</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>'Then, Vasettha, the Brahmins have forgotten their ancient tradition when they say that. Because we can see Brahmin women, the wives of Brahmins, who menstruate and become pregnant, have babies and give suck. And yet these womb-born Brahmins talk about being born from Brahma's mouth … These Brahmins misrepresent Brahma, tell lies and earn much demerit.</p>

<h3>Purifying the Four Castes</h3>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>'There are, Vasettha, these four castes: the Khattiyas, the Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans.<span class="note" id="n817"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.817] The Buddhists always place the Khattiyas first. This was their original position, and still applied in the area of the Buddha’s ministry.</span></span></span> And sometimes a Khattiya takes life, takes what is not given, commits sexual misconduct, tells lies, indulges in slander, harsh speech or idle chatter, is grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. Thus such things as are immoral and considered so, blameworthy and considered so, to be avoided and considered so, ways unbefitting an Ariyan and considered so, black with black result<span class="note" id="n818"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.818] Cf. DN 33.11. (29), also <a href="../mn/mn57.html">MN&nbsp;57</a>.</span></span></span> and blamed by the wise, are sometimes to be found among the Khattiyas, and the same applies to Brahmins, merchants and artisans.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>'Sometimes, too, a Khattiya refrains from taking life,… is not grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. Thus such things as are moral and considered so, blameless and considered so, to be followed and considered so, ways befitting an Ariyan and considered so, bright with bright results and praised by the wise, are sometimes to be found among the Khattiyas, and likewise among Brahmins, merchants and artisans.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>'Now since both dark and bright qualities, which are blamed and praised by the wise, are scattered indiscriminately among the four castes, the wise do not recognise the claim about the Brahmin caste being the highest. Why is that? Because, Vasettha, anyone from the four castes who becomes a monk, an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions, who has lived the life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden,<span class="note" id="n819"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.819] <i>Ohita-bhāro.</i></span></span></span> reached the highest goal, destroyed the fetter of becoming, and become emancipated through super-knowledge — he is proclaimed supreme by virtue of Dhamma and not of non-Dhamma.</p>

<p id="p8" class="verse"><span class="parno">8</span>Dhamma's the best thing for people
<br>In this life and the next as well.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>'This illustration will make clear to you how Dhamma is best in this world and in the next. King Pasenadi of Kosala knows: "The ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighbouring clan of the Sakyans." Now the Sakyans are vassals of the King of Kosala. They offer him humble service and salute him, rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service. And, just as the Sakyans offer the King humble service…, so likewise does the King offer humble service to the Tathāgata,<span class="note" id="n820"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.820] Cf. DN 2.35 for the respect accorded to ascetics in general.</span></span></span> thinking: "If the ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am ill-born; if the ascetic Gotama is strong, I am weak; if the ascetic Gotama is pleasant to look at, I am ill-favoured; if the ascetic Gotama is influential, I am of little influence." Now it is because of honouring the Dhamma, making much of the Dhamma, esteeming the Dhamma, doing reverent homage to the Dhamma that King Pasenadi does humble service to the Tathagata and pays him fitting service:</p>

<p class="verse">Dhamma's the best thing for people
<br>In this life and the next as well.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>'Vasettha, all of you, though of different birth, name, clan and family, who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, if you are asked who you are, should reply: "We are ascetics, followers of the Sakyan."<span class="note" id="n821"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.821] Sakyaputta: 'Son of the Sakyans'.</span></span></span> He whose faith in the Tathagata is settled, rooted, established, solid, unshakeable by any ascetic or Brahmin, any deva or mara or Brahma or anyone in the world, can truly say: "I am a true son of Blessed Lord, born of his mouth, born of Dhamma, created by Dhamma, an heir of Dhamma." Why is that? Because, Vasettha, this designates the Tathagata: "The Body of Dhamma",<span class="note" id="n822"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.822] <i>Dhamma-kāya:</i> a term which, as Dharmakāya, was destined to play a great role in Mahayana Buddhism.</span></span></span> that is, "The Body of Brahma",<span class="note" id="n823"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.823] Brahmā here means 'the highest' but is used because the Buddha is speaking to Brahmins.</span></span></span> or "Become Dhamma", that is, "Become Brahma".<span class="note" id="n824"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.824] The Tathagata, by his gaining of enlightenment by his own efforts, has become 'the highest'.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>'There comes a time, Vasettha, when, sooner or later after a long period, this world contracts.<span class="note" id="n825"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.825] Cf. DN 1.2.2.</span></span></span> At a time of contraction, beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma world. And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious — and they stay like that for a very long time.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>But sooner or later, after a very long period, this world begins to expand again. At a time of expansion, the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world, having passed away from there, are mostly reborn in this world. Here they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious<span class="note" id="n826"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.826] Though born on earth they are still devas, not human beings.</span></span></span> — and they stay like that for a very long time.</p>

<h3>The Delicious Earth Appears</h3>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>'At that period, Vāseṭṭha, there was just one mass of water, and all was darkness, blinding darkness. Neither moon nor sun appeared, no constellations or stars appeared, night and day were not distinguished, nor months and fortnights, no years or seasons, and no male and female, beings being reckoned just as beings.<span class="note" id="n827"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.827] As devas from the Brahma World they are sexless.</span></span></span> And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savoury earth<span class="note" id="n828"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.828] <i>Rasa-paṭhavī.</i> Note that all the various forms of food mentioned are vegetarian.</span></span></span> spread itself over the waters where those beings were. It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools. It was endowed with colour, smell and taste. It was the colour of fine ghee or butter, and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey.</p>

<h3>The Appearance of the Sun and Moon</h3>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>'Then some being of a greedy nature said: "I say, what can this be?" and tasted the savoury earth on its finger. In so doing, it became taken with the flavour, and craving arose in it.<span class="note" id="n829"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.829] In terms of a 'Buddhist book of Genesis' this would correspond to the eating of the fruit — but not of knowledge.</span></span></span> Then other beings, taking their cue from that one, also tasted the stuff with their fingers. They too were taken with the flavour, and craving arose in them. So they set to with their hands, breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat it. And the result of this was that their self-luminance disappeared. And as a result of the disappearance of their self-luminance, the moon and the sun appeared, night and day were distinguished, months and fortnights appeared, and the year and its seasons. To that extent the world re-evolved.</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>'And those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this savoury earth, feeding on it and being nourished by it. And as they did so, their bodies became coarser,<span class="note" id="n830"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.830] Since these beings, however glorious, are unenlightened, they fall victim to craving <i>(taṇhā)</i> and thereby progressively lose their ethereal qualities.</span></span></span> and a difference in looks developed among them. Some beings became good-looking, others ugly. And the good-looking ones despised the others, saying: "We are better-looking than they are." And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the savoury earth disappeared. At this they came together and lamented, crying: "Oh that flavour! Oh that flavour!" And so nowadays when people say: "Oh that flavour!" when they get something nice, they are repeating an ancient saying without realising it.</p>

<h3>The Appearance of Mushrooms</h3>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>'And then, when the savoury earth had disappeared, a fungus<span class="note" id="n831"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.831] <i>Bhūmi-pappaṭaka:</i> the exact meaning is unknown. RD has 'outgrowths'.</span></span></span> cropped up, in the manner of a mushroom. It was of a good colour, smell, and taste. It was the colour of fine ghee or butter, and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey.</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>And those beings set to and ate the fungus. And this lasted for a very long time. And as they continued to feed on the fungus, so their bodies became coarser still, and the difference in their looks increased still more. And the good-looking ones despised the others … And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the sweet fungus disappeared.</p>

<h3>Shoots and Creepers</h3>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>Next, creepers appeared, shooting up like bamboo …, and they too were very sweet, like pure wild honey.</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>'And those beings set to and fed on those creepers. And as they did so, their bodies became even coarser, and the difference in their looks increased still more… And they became still more arrogant, and so the creepers disappeared too.</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>At this they came together and lamented, crying: "Alas, our creeper's gone! What have we lost!" And so now today when people, on being asked why they are upset, say: "Oh, what have we lost!" they are repeating an ancient saying without realising it.</p>

<h3>Good Rice</h3>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>'And then, after the creepers had disappeared, rice appeared in open spaces,<span class="note" id="n832"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.832] In land free from the jungle (DA).</span></span></span> free from powder and from husks, fragrant and clean-grained.<span class="note" id="n833"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.833] This phrase may be a fragment of verse.</span></span></span> And what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and was ripe in the morning, and what they had taken in the morning for breakfast was ripe again by evening, with no sign of reaping. And these beings set to and fed on this rice, and this lasted for a very long time.</p>

<h3>Women's Physical Development</h3>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>And as they did so, their bodies became coarser still, and the difference in their looks became even greater. And the females developed female sex-organs,<span class="note" id="n834"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.834] As noted above, these beings were previously sexless. DA says 'those who were women in a previous life.'</span></span></span> and the males developed male organs. And the women became excessively preoccupied with men, and the men with women. Owing to this excessive preoccupation with each other, passion was aroused, and their bodies burnt with lust. And later, because of this burning, they indulged in sexual activity.<span class="note" id="n835"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.835] Hitherto they had been 'spontaneously born', a process assumed to continue (see <a href="#n849">n.849</a>).</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>But those who saw them indulging threw dust, ashes or cow-dung at them, crying: "Die, you filthy beast! How can one being do such things to another!" Just as today, in some districts, when a daughter-in-law is led out, some people throw dirt at her, some ashes, and some cow-dung, without realising that they are repeating an ancient observance. What was considered bad form in those days is now considered good form.<span class="note" id="n836"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.836] RD has gone wrong here, rendering this: 'That which was considered immoral…' The reference is not to the sexual activity, but to the throwing of dirt, etc. I have therefore transferred this sentence back from verse 17.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>Sexual Conduct</h3>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>'And those beings who in those days indulged in sex were not allowed into a village or town for one or two months. Accordingly those who indulged for an excessively long period in such immoral practices began to build themselves dwellings so as to indulge under cover.<span class="note" id="n837"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.837] The dwellings were constructed not for concealment (as implied by RD) so much as for shelter.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>'Now it occurred to one of those beings who was inclined to laziness: "Well now, why should I be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper and in the morning for breakfast? Why shouldn't I gather it all at once for both meals?" And he did so.</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>Then another one came to him and said: "Come on, let's go rice-gathering." "No need, my friend, I've gathered enough for both meals." Then the other, following his example, gathered enough rice for two days at a time, saying: "That should be about enough."</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>Then another being came and said to that second one: "Come on, let's go rice-gathering." "No need, my friend, I've gathered enough for two days." <span class="add">The same for 4, then 8, days</span>.</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>However, when those beings made a store of rice and lived on that, husk-powder and husk began to envelop the grain, and where it was reaped it did not grow again, and the cut place showed, and the rice grew in separate clusters.</p>

<h3>Distributing Rice</h3>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>'And then those beings came together lamenting: "Wicked ways have become rife among us: at first we were mind-made, feeding on delight… <span class="add">all events repeated down to the latest development, each fresh change being said to be due to 'wicked and unwholesome ways'</span>… and the rice grows in separate clusters. So now let us divide up the rice into fields with boundaries." So they did so.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>'Then, Vāseṭṭha, one greedy-natured being, while watching over his own plot, took another plot that was not given to him, and enjoyed the fruits of it. So they seized hold of him and said: "You've done a wicked thing, taking another's plot like that! Don't ever do such a thing again!" "I won't", he said, but he did the same thing a second and a third time. Again he was seized and rebuked, and some hit him with their fists, some with stones, and some with sticks. And in this way, Vasettha, taking what was not given, and censuring, and lying, and punishment, took their origin.</p>

<h3>The People's Choice</h3>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>'Then those beings came together and lamented the arising of these evil things among them: taking what was not given, censuring, lying and punishment. And they thought: "Suppose we were to appoint a certain being who would show anger where anger was due, censure those who deserved it, and banish those who deserved banishment! And in return, we would grant him a share of the rice."</p>

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>So they went to the one among them who was the handsomest, the best-looking, the most pleasant and capable, and asked him to do this for them in return for a share of the rice, and he agreed.</p>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>"'The People's Choice" is the meaning of Mahā-Sammata,<span class="note" id="n838"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.838] Name of the first king of the solar race and ancestor, among others, of the Sakyan rulers (and hence of Gotama).</span></span></span> which is the first regular title<span class="note" id="n839"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.839] <i>Akkhara:</i> later meaning letter (of the syllabary): see <a href="dn1.html#n30">n.30.</a></span></span></span> to be introduced.

<h3>Brahman Caste</h3>

<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>'Then some of these beings thought: "Evil things have appeared among beings, such as taking what is not given, censuring, lying, punishment and banishment. We ought to put aside evil and unwholesome things." And they did so. "They Put Aside<span class="note" id="n842"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.842] <i>Bāhenti.</i></span></span></span> Evil And Uwholesome Things" is the meaning of Brahmin,<span class="note" id="n843"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.843] A wholly fanciful etymology, but one which throws a light on what was considered to be the ideal of a Brahmin.</span></span></span> which is the first regular title to be introduced for such people. They made leaf-huts in forest places and meditated in them. With the smoking fire gone out, with pestle cast aside, gathering alms for their evening and morning meals, they went away to a village, town or royal city to seek their food, and then they returned to their leaf-huts to meditate. People saw this and noted how they meditated. "They Meditate"<span class="note" id="n844"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.844] Jhāyanti: from the same root as jhāna, a pre-Buddhist type of meditation.</span></span></span> is the meaning of Jhayaka,<span class="note" id="n845"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.845] 'Meditator'.</span></span></span> which is the second regular title to be introduced.</p>

<p>'However, some of those beings, not being able to meditate in leaf-huts, settled around towns and villages and compiled books.<span class="note" id="n846"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.846] <i>Ganthe:</i> to assume written books would be anachronistic.

At that time it was regarded as a low designation, but now it is the higher. This, then, Vāseṭṭha, is the origin of the class of Brahmins in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. Their origin was from among these very same beings, like themselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.</p>

<h3>Merchants and Artesians Caste</h3>

<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>'And then, Vāseṭṭha, some of those beings, having paired off,<span class="note" id="n849"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.849] 'Adopting the sexual practice' <i>(methuna-dhamma)</i>, thus implying that the others were celibate.</span></span></span> adopted various trades, and this "Various"<span class="note" id="n850"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.850] <i>Vissa:</i> 'various', hence, allegedly, vessa 'merchant'.</span></span></span> is the meaning of Vessa, which came to be the regular title for such people. This, then, is the origin of the class of Vessas, in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. Their origin was from among these very same beings…</p>

<h3>Low-Caste</h3>

<p id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>'And then, Vāseṭṭha, those beings that remained went in for hunting. "They Are Base Who Live By The Chase", and that is the meaning of Sudda,<span class="note" id="n851"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.851] A play on <i>ludda</i> 'hunting', <i>khudda</i> 'mean fellow', <i>sudda</i> 'low grade (RD's renderings). RD remarks: 'Our modem nobles would lift their eyebrows at so amazing a mixture of epithets'. Today many would agree with the sentiment expressed.</span></span></span> which came to be the regular title for such people. This, then, is the origin of the class of Suddas<span class="note" id="n852"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.852] 'Artisans'.</span></span></span> in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. Their origin was from among these very same beings…</p>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>'And then, Vāseṭṭha, it came about that some Khattiya, dissatisfied with his own Dhamma,<span class="note" id="n853"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.853] I have retained the word 'Dhamma' here (RD, as usual, has Norm'), though it is obviously not the Buddha’s Dhamma — that is what he goes forth to seek!</span></span></span> went forth from the household life into homelessness, thinking: "I will become an ascetic." And a Brahmin did likewise, a Vessa did likewise, and so did a Sudda. And from these four classes the class of ascetics came into existence. Their origin was from among these very same beings, like themselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.</p>

<h3>Bad Conduct</h3>

<p id="p38"><span class="parno">38</span>'And, Vāseṭṭha, a Khattiya who has led a bad life in body, speech and thought, and who has wrong view will, in consequence of such wrong views and deeds, at the breaking-up of the body after death, be reborn in a state of loss, an ill fate, the downfall, the hell-state. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda.</p>

<p id="p39"><span class="parno">39</span>'Likewise, a Khattiya who has led a good life in body, speech and thought, and who has right view will, in consequence of such right view and deeds, at the breaking-up of the body after death, be reborn in a good destiny, in a heaven-state. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda.</p>

<p id="p40"><span class="parno">40</span>'And a Khattiya who has performed deeds of both kinds in body, speech and thought, and whose view is mixed will, in consequence of such mixed views and deeds, at the breaking-up of the body after death, experience both pleasure and pain. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda.</p>

<h3>A Khattiya's Enlightenment</h3>

<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>'And a Khattiya who is restrained in body, speech and thought, and who has developed the seven requisites of enlightenment,<span class="note" id="n854"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.854] See DN 22.16 and notes there.</span></span></span> will attain to Parinibbana<span class="note" id="n855"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.855] <i>Parinibbāna</i> is the attainment of final Nibbāna, as in DN 16.</span></span></span> in this very life. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>'And, Vasettha, whoever of these four castes, as a monk, becomes an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained to the highest goal, completely destroyed the fetter of becoming, and become liberated by the highest insight, he is declared to be chief among them in accordance with Dhamma, and not otherwise.</p>

<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>'Vasettha, it was Brahma Sanankumara who spoke this verse:</p>
