<h3>Pride Humbled</h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large number of monks, some five hundred, and he came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Icchanankala. And he stayed in the dense jungle of Icchanankala.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>At that time the Brahmin Pokkharasati was living at Ukkhattha, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers.<span class="note" id="n141"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.141] A stock phrase, as at DN 4.1, 5.1, <a href="../mn/mn95.html">MN&nbsp;95.1</a>, etc. RD translates ‘on a royal domain… as a royal gift <i>(rājadāyaṁ),</i> with power over it as if he were the king <i>(brahmadeyyaṁ)’</i>. <i>Brahmadeyyaṁ</i> = ‘supreme gift’, one which could not be revoked.</span></span></span>

<p>And Pokkharasati heard say:</p>

<p>‘The ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan,…is staying in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about: “This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.” He proclaims this world with its gods, maras, Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’</p>

<h4>Young Ambaṭṭha</h4>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>Now at that time Pokkharasāti had a pupil, the youth Ambattha, who was a student of the Vedas, who knew the mantras, perfected in the Three Vedas, a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals, the lore of sounds and meanings and, fifthly, oral tradition, complete in philosophy<span class="note" id="n142"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.142] Another stock description, of a learned Brahmin.</span></span></span> and in the marks<span class="note" id="n143"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.143] For a full account of these (pre-Buddhist) marks, see <a href="dn30.html">DN 30</a>. They are clearly important to the Brahmin as establishing ‘the ascetic Gotama’s’ credentials.</span></span></span> of a Great Man, admitted and accepted by his master in the Three Vedas with the words: ‘What I know, you know; what you know, I know.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">4</span>And Pokkharasati said to Ambattha: ‘Ambattha, my son, the ascetic Gotama … is staying in the dense jungle of Icchānankala. And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about …</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">5</span>Now you go to see the ascetic Gotama and find out whether this report is correct or not, and whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not. In that way we shall put the Reverend Gotama to the test.’</p>

<p>Sir, how shall I find out whether the report is true, or whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not?’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">6</span>"According to the tradition of our mantras, Ambattha, the great man who is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man has only two courses open to him. If he lives the household life he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law,<span class="note" id="m144"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.144] See <a href="dn17.html">DN 17.</a></span></span></span> conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures.<span class="note" id="n145"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.145] </span></span></span> These are: the Wheel-Treasure, the Elephant-Treasure, the Horse-Treasure, the Jewel-Treasure, the Woman-Treasure, the Householder-Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor-Treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law. But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, one who draws back the veil from the world.<span class="note" id="n146"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.146] <i>Loke vivattacchado:</i> a difficult expression. I follow DA. The ‘veil’ is that of ignorance, etc.</span></span></span> And, Ambattha, I am the passer-on of the mantras, and you are the receiver.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">7</span>‘Very good, sir’, said Ambattha at Pokkharasāti’s words, and he got up, passed by Pokkharasati with his right side, got into his chariot drawn by a mare and, accompanied by a number of young men, headed for the dense jungle of Icchānankala. He drove as far as the carriage would go, then alighted and continued on foot.</p>

<p>At that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the open air. Ambattha approached them and said: ‘Where is the Reverend Gotama to be found just now? We have come to see the Reverend Gotama.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>The monks thought: ‘This is Ambattha, a youth of good family and a pupil of the distinguished Brahmin Pokkharasāti. The Lord would not mind having a conversation with such a young man.’ And they said to Ambattha: ‘That is his dwelling, with the door closed. Go quietly up to it, go on to the verandah without haste, cough, and knock on the bolt. The Lord will open the door to you.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span> Ambattha went up to the dwelling and on to the verandah, coughed, and knocked. The Lord opened the door, and Ambaṭṭha went in. The young men entered, exchanged courtesies with the Lord, and sat down to one side. But Ambattha walked up and down while the Lord sat there, uttered some vague words of politeness, and then stood so speaking before the seated Lord.</p>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>And the Lord said to Ambattha: ‘Well now, Ambattha, would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned Brahmins, teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and standing while I am sitting, and uttering vague words of politeness?’</p>

<h5>&nbsp;</h5>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>‘No, Reverend Gotama. A Brahmin should walk with a walking Brahmin, stand with a standing Brahmin, sit with a sitting Brahmin, and lie down with a Brahmin who is lying down. But as for those shaven little ascetics, menials, black scourings from Brahmā’s foot, with them it is fitting to speak just as I do with the Reverend Gotama.’</p>

<p>‘But, Ambattha, you came here seeking something. Whatever it was you came for, you should listen attentively to hear about it. Ambattha, you have not perfected your training. Your conceit of being trained is due to nothing but inexperience.’

<p><span class="parno">12</span>But Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained, and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults. Thinking: ‘The ascetic Gotama bears me ill-will’, he said: ‘Reverend Gotama, the Sakyans are fierce, rough-spoken, touchy and violent. Being of menial origin, being menials, they do not honour, respect, esteem, revere or pay homage to Brahmins. With regard to this it is not proper… that they do not pay homage to Brahmins.’ </p>

<p>This was the first time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.</p>

<h5>&nbsp;</h5>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>‘But, Ambattha, what have the Sakyans done to you?’ </p>

<p>‘Reverend Gotama, once I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti, and I came to the Sakyans’ meeting-hall. And at that time a lot of Sakyans were sitting on high seats in their meeting-hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing about together, and it seemed to me that they were just making fun of me, and no one offered me a seat. With regard to this, it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the Brahmins.’ </p>

<p>This was the second time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.</p>

<h5>&nbsp;</h5>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>‘But Ambattha, even the quail, that little bird, can talk as she likes on her own nest. Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans’ home, Ambattha. They do not deserve censure for such a trifle.’</p>

<p>‘Reverend Gotama, there are four castes:<span class="note" id="n147"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.147] This division into four groups shows the earliest stage of the caste-system. In the Buddha’s time and in his homeland, the Khattiyas (‘Warior-Nobles’), to whom he belonged, still formed the first caste, with the Brahmins taking second place, though the latter had already established themselves as the leading caste further west, and were clearly fighting for that position here. The Buddha himself often refers to a different fourfold grouping: Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders and ascetics.</span></span></span> the Khattiyas, the Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans. And of these four castes three — the Khattiyas, the merchants and the artisans — are entirely subservient to the Brahmins. With regard to this, it is not proper that they should not pay homage to the Brahmins.’ </p>

<p>This was the third time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.</p>

<h5>&nbsp;</h5>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>Then the Lord thought: ‘This young man goes too far in abusing the Sakyans. Suppose I were to ask after his clan-name? ’ So he said: </p>

<p>‘Ambattha, what is your clan?’ </p>

<p>‘I am a Kaṇhāyan, Reverend Gotama.’</p>

<hr>
<p>‘Ambattha, in former days, according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans. For the Sakyans regard King Okkāka as their ancestor. </p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>At one time King Okkāka, to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom — Okkamukha, Karandu, Hatthiniya and Sinipura. And these, being banished, made their home on the flank of the Himālayas beside a lotus-pond where there was a big grove of teak-trees.<span class="note"  id="n148"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n148] <i>Sākasaṇḍa.</i> The word <i>sāka</i> can also mean ‘herb’ (RD), but here surely bears its other meaning of ‘teak’. RD deliberately mistranslated as ‘oak’ for the sake of a somewhat feeble play on words. There is an actual play on <i>sakāhi</i> ‘own (sisters)’ just previously.</span></span></span> And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own sisters. </p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">17</span>Then King Okkāka asked his ministers and counsellors: “Where are the princes living now?” and they told him. </p>

<hr>
<p>At this King Okkāha exclaimed: “They are strong as teak <i>(sāka)</i>, these princes, they are real Sakyans!”<span class="note" id="n149"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.149] In conformity with the previous note, RD here translates ‘hearts of oak’ (!).</span></span></span> </p>

<p>And that is how the Sakyans got their well-known name. And the King was the ancestor of the Sakyans.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">18</span>‘Now King Okkāka had a slave-girl called Disā, who gave birth to a black child. The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed: “Wash me, mother! Bath me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt, and I will bring you profit!” </p>

<p>Because, Ambattha, just as people today use the term hobgoblin (pisāca) as a term of abuse, so in those days they said black (kaṇha). And they said: “As soon as he was born, he spoke. He is born a Kanha, a hobgoblin!” That is how in former days…the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">19</span>On hearing this, the young men said: ‘Reverend Gotama, do not humiliate Ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a slave-girl: Ambattha is well-born, of a good family, he is very learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, well able to hold his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama!’</p>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>Then the Lord said to the young men: ‘If you consider that Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, unlearned, ill-spoken, no scholar, unable to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama, then let Ambattha be silent, and you conduct this discussion with me. But if you think he is… able to hold his own, then you be quiet, and let him discuss with me.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">21</span>‘Ambattha is well-born, Reverend Gotama… We will be silent, he shall continue.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">22</span>Then the Lord said to Ambattha: ‘Ambattha, I have a fundamental question for you, which you will not like to answer. If you don’t answer, or evade the issue, if you keep silent or go away, your head will split into seven pieces. What do you think, Ambattha? Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where the Kaṇhāyans came from, or who was their ancestor?’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">23</span>At this, Ambattha remained silent. The Lord asked him a second time. Again Ambattha remained silent, and the Lord said: ‘Answer me now, Ambattha, this is not a time for silence. Whoever, Ambattha, does not answer a fundamental question put to him by a Tathāgata by the third asking has his head split into seven pieces.’<span class="note" id="n150"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.150] A curious threat that (as RD observes) never comes to anything, and is of course pre-Buddhist.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">24</span>And at that moment Vajirapāni the yakkha,<span class="note" id="n151"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.151] This yakkha, equated by DA with Indra, is ready, as in <a href="../mn/mn35.html#p14">MN&nbsp;35.14,</a> to take the threat literally. Thus one of the old gods is seen as supporting the new religion. In later Mahayana texts we find a Bodhisattva of the same name. See D.L. Snellgrove, <i>Buddhist Himālaya</i> (Oxford 1957), p. 62, and I.B. Homer’s note, <a href="dn0-abbr.html">MLS</a> i, p. 185.</span></span></span> holding a huge iron club, flaming, ablaze and glowing, up in the sky just above Ambattha, was thinking: ‘If this young man Ambattha does not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the third time of asking, I’ll split his head into seven pieces!’ The Lord saw Vajirapāni, and so did Ambattha. </p>

<p><span class="parno">25</span>And at the sight, Ambattha was terrified and unnerved, his hairs stood on end, and he sought protection, shelter and safety from the Lord. Crouching down close to the Lord, he said: ‘What did the Reverend Gotama say? May the Reverend Gotama repeat what he said!’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">26</span>‘What do you think, Ambattha? Have you heard who was the ancestor of the Kaṇhāyans?’ </p>

<p>‘Yes, I have heard it just as the Reverend Gotama said, that is where the Kaṇhāyans came from, he was their ancestor.’</p>

<h5>&nbsp;</h5>

<p><span class="parno">27</span>Hearing this, the young men made a loud noise and clamour: ‘So Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, born of a slave-girl of the Sakyans, and the Sakyans are Ambattha’s masters! We disparaged the ascetic Gotama, thinking he was not speaking the truth!’</p>

<p><span class="parno">28</span>Then the Lord thought: ‘It is too much, the way these young men humiliate Ambattha for being the son of a slave-girl. I must get him out of this.’ So he said to the young men: ‘Don’t disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave-girl!

<p>‘Ambattha, it is not from the standpoint of the attainment of unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct that reputation based on birth and clan is declared, nor on the conceit which says: “You are worthy of me, you are not worthy of me!” For wherever there is a giving, a taking, or a giving and taking in marriage, there is always this talk and this conceit… But those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct, which is attained by abandoning all such things!’</p>

<p>In the first place, an ascetic or Brahmin who has not managed to gain<span class="note" id="n159"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.159] <i>Anabhisambhūṇamāno:</i> almost literally ‘not up to it’.</span></span></span> this unexcelled attainment, takes his carrying-pole<span class="note" id="n160"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.160] A pole or yoke for carrying his possessions.</span></span></span> and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking: “I will live on windfalls.” But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained.

<p>This is the fourth path of failure.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">50</span>‘What do you think, Ambattha? Do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct?’ </p>

<p>‘No indeed, Reverend Gotama! Who are my teacher and I in comparison? We are far from it!’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">51-53</span>‘Well then, Ambattha, could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this…, go with your carrying-poles into the depths of the forest, intending to live on windfalls?’ </p>

See, Ambattha, how your teacher has let you down!</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p><span class="parno">56</span>‘Ambattha, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti lives by the grace and favour of King Pasenadi of Kosala. And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face. When he confers with the King it is through a curtain. Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue?

<p><span class="parno">57</span>‘What do you think, Ambattha?

<p><span class="parno">58</span>‘Well then, Ambattha, it is just the same thing. Those who were, as you say, the first sages of the Brahmins, the makers and expounders of the mantras, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today — Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, Bhagu<span class="note" id="n163"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n163] Ancient rishis associated with the Vedic hymns (cf.

<p><span class="parno">59</span>‘What do you think, Ambattha? What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Those first sages…, Atthaka, … Bhagu — did they enjoy themselves, well-bathed, perfumed, their hair and beards trimmed, adorned with garlands and wreaths, dressed in white clothes, indulging in the pleasures of the five senses and addicted to them, as you and your teacher do now?’ </p>

<p>‘No Reverend Gotama.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">60</span>‘Or did they eat special fine rice with the black spots removed, with various soups and curries, as you and your teacher do now?’ </p>

<p>‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">61</span>‘Or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows, as you and your teacher do now?’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">63</span>‘Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades, by men with long swords … ?’ </p>

<p>‘No, Reverend Gotama.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">64</span>‘So, Ambattha, neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage. And now, as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me, we will clarify these by your asking me, and by my answering your questions.’</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p><span class="parno">65</span>Then, descending from his lodging, the Lord started to walk up and down, and Ambattha did likewise. And as he walked along with the Lord, Ambattha looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord’s body. And he could see all of them except for two. He was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks: he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">66</span>And the Lord, being aware of his doubts, effected by his psychic power that Ambattha could see his sheathed genitals, and then, sticking out his tongue, he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils, and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue. Then Ambattha thought: </p>

<hr>
<p>‘The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none missing.’ Then he said to the Lord: ‘Reverend Gotama, may I go now? I have much business, much to do.’ ‘Ambattha, do what you now think fit.’ </p>

<p>So Ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">67-68</span>Meanwhile the Brahmin Pokkharasati had gone outside and was sitting in his park with a large number of Brahmins, just waiting for Ambattha. Then Ambattha came to the park. He rode in the chariot as far as it would go, and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati was, saluted him, and sat down to one side. Then Pokkharasati said:</p>

<hr>
<p>‘Well, dear boy, did you see the Reverend Gotama?’ </p>

<p>‘I did, sir.’</p>

<p>‘And was the Reverend Gotama such as he is reported to be, and not otherwise? And is he of such nature, and not otherwise?’ </p>

<p>‘Sir, he is as he is reported to be, and he is of such nature and not otherwise. He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, all complete, with none missing.’</p>

<p>‘But was there any conversation between you and the ascetic Gotama?’ </p>

<p>‘There was, sir.’</p>

<p>‘And what was this conversation about?’ So Ambattha told Pokkharasati all that had passed between the Lord and himself.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">69</span>At this Pokkharasāti exclaimed: ‘Well, you’re a fine little scholar, a fine wise man, a fine expert in the Three Vedas! Anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies, at the breaking-up of the body, to go to the downfall, to the evil path, to ruin, to hell! You have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama, as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against us! You’re a fine little scholar … !’ He was so angry and enraged that he kicked Ambattha over, and wanted to start out at once to see the Lord.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p><span class="parno">70</span>But the Brahmins said: ‘It is far too late, sir, to go to see the ascetic Gotama today. The Reverend Pokkharasāti should go to see him tomorrow.’</p>

<p>Then Pokkharasāti, having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his own home, set out by the light of torches from Ukkattha for the jungle of Icchānankala. He went by chariot as far as possible, then continued on foot to where the Lord was. </p>

<p><span class="parno">71</span>Having exchanged courtesies with the Lord, he sat down to one side and said:</p>

<p>‘Venerable Gotama, did not our pupil Ambattha come to see you?’ </p>

<p>‘He did, Brahmin.’</p>

<hr>
<p>‘And was there any conversation between you?’</p>

<p>‘There was.’</p>

<p>‘And what was this conversation about?’</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Lord told Pokkharasāti all that had passed between him and Ambattha. At this, Pokkharasāti said to the Lord:</p>

<p> ‘Reverend Gotama, Ambattha is a young fool. May the Reverend Gotama pardon him.’ ‘Brahmin, may Ambattha be happy.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">72-74</span>Then Pokkharasāti looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord’s body and he could see all of them except for two: the sheathed genitals and the large tongue; but the Lord set his mind at rest about these (as verse 11 — 12). And Pokkharasāti said to the Lord: ‘May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from me today together with his order of monks!’ And the Lord consented by silence.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">75</span>Seeing his acceptance, Pokkharasāti said to the Lord: ‘It is time, Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready.’ And the Lord, having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl,<span class="note" id="n164"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.164] A frequent formula, belatedly explained by RD at DN 16.5.19. ‘The Wanderers … lived with only one robe on, the one from the waist to the feet. When they set out for the village … they put on the second robe and … carried the third with them. At some convenient spot near the village they would put this also on, and enter — so to speak — in full canonicals.’</span></span></span> went with his order of monks to Pokkharasāti’s residence, and sat down on the prepared seat. Then Pokkharasāti personally served the Lord with choice hard and soft food, and the young men served the monks. And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl, Pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stool.</p>

<p><span class="parno">76</span>And as Pokkharasati sat there, the Lord delivered a graduated discourse on generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing the danger, degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of renunciation. And when the Lord knew that Pokkharasāti’s mind was ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm, then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief: on suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly, so in the Brahmin Pokkharasati, as he sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye, and he knew: ‘Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation.’<span class="note" id="n165"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.165] This passage recurs at DN 5.29, DN 14.11 and elsewhere. For the Dhamma-eye see <a href="dn2.html#n140">DN2 n.140</a>. The Pali phrase is <i>Yaṁ kiñci samudaya-dhammaṁ taṁ nirodha-dhammaṁ.</i></span></span></span></p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p><span class="parno">77</span>And Pokkharasati, having seen, attained, experienced and penetrated the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended uncertainty, having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher’s doctrine without relying on others, said: </p>

<p>‘Excellent, Lord, excellent! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways … I go with my son, my wife, my ministers and counsellors for refuge to the Reverend Gotama, to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.166] Pokkharasati did not apparently consult his wife, family and dependents. When Uruvela-Kassapa wanted to join the Saṅgha, the Buddha bade him first consult his 500 followers (Mv 1.20.18). But there is of course a big difference between becoming a lay-follower and joining the Saṅgha.</span></span></span> May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last! And whenever the Reverend Gotama visits other families or lay-followers in Ukkattha, may he also visit the family of Pokkharasati! Whatever young men and maidens are there will revere the Reverend Gotama and rise before him, will give him a seat and water and will be glad at heart, and that will be for their welfare and happiness for a long time.’</p>
