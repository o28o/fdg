<p><span class="parno">1</span><span>So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants!”</p>


<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>“There are thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other. If he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea, he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>And what are the thirty-two marks?</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>He has well-planted feet.</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>On the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>He has projecting heels. … He has long fingers. … His hands and feet are tender. … His hands and feet cling gracefully. … His feet are arched. … His calves are like those of an antelope. … When standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees. … His private parts are retracted. … He is gold colored; his skin has a golden sheen. … He has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body. … His hairs grow one per pore. … His hairs stand up; they’re blue-black and curl clockwise. … His body is as straight as Brahmā’s. … He has bulging muscles in seven places. … His chest is like that of a lion. … The gap between the shoulder-blades is filled in. … He has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree: the span of his arms equals the height of his body. … His torso is cylindrical. … He has an excellent sense of taste. … His jaw is like that of a lion. … He has forty teeth. … His teeth are even. … His teeth have no gaps. … His teeth are perfectly white. … He has a large tongue. … He has the voice of Brahmā, like a cuckoo’s call. … His eyes are deep blue. … He has eyelashes like a cow’s. … Between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and white like cotton-wool.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>His head is shaped like a turban.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>These are the thirty-two marks of a great man. A great man who possesses these has only two possible destinies, no other.</p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>Seers outside of Buddhism remember these marks, but they do not know the specific deeds performed in the past to obtain each mark.</p>

<h2>1. Well-Planted Feet </h2>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>In some past lives, past existences, past abodes the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He firmly undertook and persisted in skillful behaviors such as good conduct by way of body, speech, giving and sharing, taking precepts, observing the sabbath, paying due respect to mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in the family, and various other things pertaining to skillful behaviors. Due to performing, accumulating, heaping up, and amassing those deeds, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. There he surpassed the other gods in ten respects: divine life span, beauty, happiness, glory, sovereignty, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. When he passed away from there and came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark of a great man: he has well-planted feet. He places his foot on the ground evenly, raises it evenly, and touches the ground evenly with the whole sole of his foot.</p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea — free of harassment by bandits, successful and prosperous, safe, blessed, and untroubled — he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. And what does he obtain as king? He can’t be stopped by any human foe or enemy. That’s what he obtains as king. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He can’t be stopped by any foe or enemy whether internal or external; nor by greed, hate, or delusion; nor by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">13</span>
“Truth, principle, self-control, and restraint; <br>
purity, precepts, and observing the sabbath; <br>
giving, harmlessness, delighting in non-violence — <br>
firmly undertaking these things, he lived accordingly.</p>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">14</span>
	By means of these deeds he went to heaven, <br>
	where he enjoyed happiness and merriment. <br>
	After passing away from there to here, <br>
	he steps evenly on this rich earth.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">15</span>
	The gathered soothsayers predicted <br>
	that there is no stopping one of such even tread, <br>
	as householder or renunciate. <br>
	That’s the meaning shown by this mark.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">16</span>
	While living at home he cannot be stopped, <br>
	he defeats his foes, and cannot be beaten. <br>
	Due to the fruit of that deed, <br>
	he cannot be stopped by any human.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">17</span>
	But if he chooses the life gone forth, <br>
	seeing clearly, loving renunciation, <br>
	not even the best can hope to stop him; <br>
	this is the nature of the supreme person.”</p>


<h2>2. Wheels on the Feet </h2>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He brought happiness to many people, eliminating threats, terror, and danger, providing just protection and security, and giving gifts with all the trimmings. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark: on the soles of his feet there are thousand-spoked wheels, with rims and hubs, complete in every detail and well divided inside.</p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He has a large following of brahmins and householders, people of town and country, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, counselors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes. That’s what he obtains as king. But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a fully awakened Buddha. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He has a large following of monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, demons, dragons, and fairies. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">21</span>
	“In olden days, in past lives, <br>
	he brought happiness to many people, <br>
	ridding them of fear, terror, and danger, <br>
	zealously guarding and protecting them.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">22</span>
	By means of these deeds he went to heaven, <br>
	where he enjoyed happiness and merriment. <br>
	After passing away from there to here, <br>
	wheels on his two feet are found,</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">23</span>
	all rimmed around and thousand-spoked. <br>
	The gathered soothsayers predicted, <br>
	seeing the prince with the hundred-fold mark of merits, <br>
	that he’d have a following, subduing foes,</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">24</span>
	which is why he has wheels all rimmed around. <br>
	If he doesn’t choose the life gone forth, <br>
	he’ll roll the wheel and rule the land. <br>
	The aristocrats will be his vassals,</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">25</span>
	flocking to his glory. <br>
	But if he chooses the life gone forth, <br>
	seeing clearly, loving renunciation, <br>
	the gods, humans, demons, Sakka, and monsters;</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">26</span>
	fairies and dragons, birds and beasts, <br>
	will flock to his glory, <br>
	the supreme, honored by gods and humans.”</p>


<h2>3–5. Projecting Heels, Etc. </h2>

<p><span class="parno">27</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He gave up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. He was scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained these three marks: he has projecting heels, long fingers, and his body is as straight as Brahmā’s.</p>

<p><span class="parno">28</span>Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He’s long lived, preserving his life for a long time. No human foe or enemy is able to take his life before his time. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He’s long lived, preserving his life for a long time. No foes or enemies — nor any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or anyone in the world — is able to take his life before his time. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">29</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">30</span>
	“Realizing for himself the horrors of death, <br>
	he refrained from killing other creatures. <br>
	By that good conduct he went to heaven, <br>
	where he enjoyed the fruit of deeds well done.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">31</span>
	Passing away, on his return to here, <br>
	he obtained these three marks: <br>
	his projecting heels are full and long, <br>
	and he’s straight, beautiful, and well-formed, like Brahmā.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">32</span>
	Fair of limb, youthful, of good posture and breeding, <br>
	his fingers are soft and tender and long. <br>
	By these three marks of an excellent man, <br>
	they indicated that the prince’s life would be long:</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">33</span>
	‘As a householder he will live long; <br>
	longer still if he goes forth, due to <br>
	mastery in the development of psychic power. <br>
	Thus this is the sign of long life.’”</p>


<h2>6. Seven Bulges </h2>

<p><span class="parno">34</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He was a donor of fine and tasty foods and drinks of all kinds, delicious and scrumptious. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark: he has bulging muscles in seven places. He has bulges on both hands, both feet, both shoulders, and his chest.</p>

<p><span class="parno">35</span>Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He gets fine and tasty foods and drinks of all kinds, delicious and scrumptious. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He gets fine and tasty foods and drinks of all kinds, delicious and scrumptious. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">36</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">37</span>
	“He used to give the very best of flavors — <br>
	scrumptious foods of every kind. <br>
	Because of that good deed, <br>
	he rejoiced long in Nandana heaven.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">38</span>
	On returning to here, he got seven bulging muscles <br>
	and tender hands and feet are found. <br>
	The soothsayers expert in signs declared: <br>
	‘He’ll get tasty foods of all sorts</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">39</span>
	as a householder, that’s what that means. <br>
	But even if he goes forth he’ll get the same, <br>
	supreme in gaining tasty foods of all sorts, <br>
	cutting all bonds of the lay life.’”</p>

<h2>7–8. Tender and Clinging Hands </h2>

<p><span class="parno">40</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He brought people together using the four ways of being inclusive: giving, kindly words, taking care, and equality. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained these two marks: his hands and feet are tender, and they cling gracefully.</p>

<p><span class="parno">41</span>Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? His retinue is inclusive, cohesive, and well-managed. This includes brahmins and householders, people of town and country, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, counselors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? His retinue is inclusive, cohesive, and well-managed. This includes monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, demons, dragons, and fairies. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">42</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">43</span>
	“By giving and helping others, <br>
	kindly speech, and equal treatment, <br>
	such action and conduct as brought people together, <br>
	he went to heaven due to his esteemed virtue.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">44</span>
	Passing away, on his return to here, <br>
	the young baby prince obtained <br>
	hands and feet so tender and clinging, <br>
	lovely, graceful, and good-looking.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">45</span>
	His retinue is loyal and manageable, <br>
	staying agreeably all over this broad land. <br>
	Speaking kindly, desiring happiness, <br>
	he practices the good qualities he’s adopted.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">46</span>
	But if he gives up all sensual enjoyments, <br>
	as victor he speaks Dhamma to the people. <br>
	Devoted, they respond to his words; <br>
	after listening, they practice in line with the teaching.”</p>

<h2>9–10. Arched Feet and Upright Hair </h2>

<p><span class="parno">47</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. His speech was meaningful and principled. He educated many people, bringing welfare and happiness, offering the teaching. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained these two marks: his feet are arched and his hairs stand up.</p>

<p><span class="parno">48</span>Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He is the foremost, best, chief, highest, and finest of those who enjoy sensual pleasures. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He is the foremost, best, chief, highest, and finest of all sentient beings. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">49</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">50</span>
“His word was meaningful and principled, <br>
moving the people with his explanations. <br>
He brought welfare and happiness to creatures, <br>
unstintingly offering up teaching.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">51</span>
Because of that good deed, <br>
he went to heaven, and there rejoiced. <br>
On return to here two marks are found, <br>
of excellence and supremacy.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">52</span>
His hairs stand upright, <br>
and his ankles stand out well. <br>
Swollen with flesh and blood, and wrapped in skin, <br>
they make it pretty above the feet.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">53</span>
If such a one lives in the home, <br>
he becomes best of those who enjoy sensual pleasures. <br>
There’ll be none better than him; <br>
he’ll live having mastered all India.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">54</span>
But going forth the peerless renunciate <br>
becomes best of all creatures. <br>
There’ll be none better than him, <br>

<h2>11. Antelope Calves </h2>

<p><span class="parno">55</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He was a thorough teacher of a profession, a branch of knowledge, conduct, or action, thinking: ‘How might they quickly learn and practice, without getting exhausted?’ Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark: his calves are like those of an antelope.</p>

<p><span class="parno">56</span>Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He quickly obtains the things worthy of a king, the factors, supports, and things befitting a king. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He quickly obtains the things worthy of an ascetic, the factors, supports, and things befitting an ascetic. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">57</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">58</span>
		“In professions, knowledge, conduct, and deeds, <br>
	he thought of how they might swiftly learn. <br>
	Things that harm no-one at all, <br>
	he quickly taught so they would not get tired.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">59</span>
		Having done that skillful deed whose outcome is happiness, <br>
	he gains prominent and elegant calves. <br>
	Well-formed in graceful spirals, <br>
	he’s covered in fine rising hairs.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">60</span>
		They say that person has antelope calves, <br>
	and that this is the mark of swift success. <br>
	If he desires the things of the household life, <br>
	not going forth, they’ll quickly be his.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">61</span>
		But if he chooses the life gone forth, <br>
	seeing clearly, loving renunciation, <br>
	the peerless renunciate will quickly find <br>
	what is fitting and suitable.”</p>

<h2>12. Delicate Skin </h2>

<p><span class="parno">62</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He approached an ascetic or brahmin and asked: ‘Sirs, what is skillful? What is unskillful? What is blameworthy? What is blameless? What should be cultivated? What should not be cultivated? Doing what leads to my lasting harm and suffering? Doing what leads to my lasting welfare and happiness?’ Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark: he has delicate skin, so delicate that dust and dirt don’t stick to his body.</p>

<p><span class="parno">63</span>Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He has great wisdom. Of those who enjoy sensual pleasures, none is his equal or better in wisdom. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He has great wisdom, widespread wisdom, laughing wisdom, swift wisdom, sharp wisdom, and penetrating wisdom. No sentient being is his equal or better in wisdom. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">64</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">65</span>
	“In olden days, in past lives, <br>
	eager to understand, he asked questions. <br>
	Keen to learn, he waited on renunciates, <br>
	heeding their explanation with pure intent.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">66</span>
	Due to that deed of acquiring wisdom, <br>
	as a human being his skin is delicate. <br>
	At his birth the soothsayers expert in signs prophesied: <br>
	‘He’ll discern delicate matters.’</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">67</span>
	If he doesn’t choose the life gone forth, <br>
	he’ll roll the wheel and rule the land. <br>
	Among those with material possessions who have been educated, <br>
	none equal or better than him is found.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">68</span>
	But if he chooses the life gone forth, <br>
	seeing clearly, loving renunciation, <br>
	gaining wisdom that’s supreme and eminent, <br>
	the one of superb, vast intelligence attains awakening.”</p>

<h2>13. Golden Skin </h2>

<p><span class="parno">69</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He wasn’t irritable or bad-tempered. Even when heavily criticized he didn’t lose his temper, become annoyed, hostile, and hard-hearted, or display annoyance, hate, and bitterness. He donated soft and fine mats and blankets, and fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk, and wool. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark: he is gold colored; his skin has a golden sheen.</p>

<p><span class="parno">70</span>Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king?

He obtains soft and fine mats and blankets, and fine cloths of linen, cotton, silk, and wool. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">71</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">72</span>
	“Dedicated to good will, he gave gifts. <br>
	In an earlier life he poured forth cloth <br>
	fine and soft to touch, <br>
	like a god pouring rain on this broad earth.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">73</span>
	So doing he passed from here to heaven, <br>
	where he enjoyed the fruits of deeds well done. <br>
	Here he wins a figure of gold, <br>
	like Inda, the finest of gods.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">74</span>
	If that man stays in the house, not wishing to go forth, <br>
	he conquers and rules this vast, broad earth. <br>
	He obtains abundant excellent cloth, <br>
	so fine and soft to touch.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">75</span>
	He receives robes, cloth, and the finest garments <br>
	if he chooses the life gone forth. <br>
	For he still partakes of past deed’s fruit; <br>
	what’s been done is never lost.”</p>

<h2>14. Retracted Privates </h2>

<p><span class="parno">76</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He reunited long-lost and long-separated relatives, friends, loved ones, and companions. He reunited mother with child and child with mother; father with child and child with father; brother with brother, brother with sister, sister with brother, and sister with sister, bringing them together with rejoicing. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark: his private parts are retracted.</p>

<p><span class="parno">77</span>Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He has many sons, over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He has many sons, many thousands of sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">78</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">79</span>
	“In olden days, in past lives, <br>

	and long-separated friends and family, <br>
	bringing them together with joy.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">80</span>
	By means of these deeds he went to heaven, <br>

	After passing away from there to here, <br>
	his private parts are retracted.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">81</span>
	Such a one has many sons, <br>

	valiant and heroic, devastating foes, <br>
	a layman’s joy, speaking kindly.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">82</span>
	But if he lives the renunciate life <br>
	he has even more sons following his word. <br>
	As householder or renunciate, <br>
	that’s the meaning shown by this mark.”</p>

<p>The first recitation section is finished.</p>

<h2>15–16. Equal Proportions and Touching the Knees </h2>

<p><span class="parno">83</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He regarded the gathered population equally. He knew what they had in common and what was their own. He knew each person, and he knew the distinctions between people. In each case, he made appropriate distinctions between people: ‘This one deserves that; that one deserves this.’ Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained these two marks: he has the proportional circumference of a banyan tree; and when standing upright and not bending over, the palms of both hands touch the knees.</p>

<p><span class="parno">84</span>Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He is rich, affluent, and wealthy, with lots of gold and silver, lots of property and assets, lots of money and grain, and a full treasury and storehouses. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He is rich, affluent, and wealthy. He has these kinds of wealth: the wealth of faith, ethical conduct, conscience, prudence, learning, generosity, and wisdom. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">85</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">86</span>
	“Observing the many people in a community, <br>
	he weighed, evaluated, and judged each case: <br>
	‘This one deserves that.’ <br>
	That’s how he used to draw distinctions between people.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">87</span>
	Now standing without bending <br>
	he can touch his knees with both hands. <br>
	With the remaining ripening of the fruit of good deeds, <br>
	his circumference was that of a great tree.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">88</span>
	Learned experts in the many different <br>
	signs and marks prophesied: <br>
	‘The young prince will obtain <br>
	many different things that householders deserve.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">89</span>
	Here there are many suitable pleasures <br>
	for the ruler of the land to enjoy as householder. <br>
	But if he gives up all sensual enjoyments, <br>
	he will gain the supreme, highest peak of wealth.’”</p>

<h2>17–19. A Lion’s Chest, Etc. </h2>

<p><span class="parno">90</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He desired the good, the welfare, the comfort, and sanctuary of the people, thinking: ‘How might they flourish in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, teachings, and wisdom; in wealth and grain, fields and land, birds and beasts, children and partners; in bondservants, workers, and staff; in family, friends, and kin?’ Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained these three marks: his chest is like that of a lion; the gap between the shoulder-blades is filled in; and his torso is cylindrical.</p>

<p><span class="parno">91</span>Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He’s not liable to decline. He doesn’t decline in wealth and grain, fields and land, birds and beasts, children and partners; in bondservants, workers, and staff; in family, friends, and kin. He doesn’t decline in any of his accomplishments. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He’s not liable to decline. He doesn’t decline in faith, ethics, learning, generosity, and wisdom. He doesn’t decline in any of his accomplishments. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">92</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">93</span>
	“His wish was this: ‘How may others not decline <br>
	in faith, ethics, learning, and intelligence, <br>
	in generosity, teachings, and much good else, <br>
	in coin and corn, fields and lands,</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">94</span>
	in children, partners, and livestock, <br>
	in family, friends, and kin, <br>
	in health, and both beauty and happiness?’ <br>
	And so he ever desired their success.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">95</span>
	His chest was full like that of a lion, <br>
	his shoulder-gap filled in, and torso cylindrical. <br>
	Due to the well-done deeds of the past, <br>
	he had that portent of non-decline.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">96</span>
	Even as layman he grows in corn and coin, <br>
	in wives, children, and livestock. <br>
	But once gone forth, owning nothing, he attains <br>
	the supreme awakening which may never decline.”</p>

<h2>20. Excellent Sense of Taste </h2>

<p><span class="parno">97</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He would never hurt any sentient being with fists, stones, rods, or swords. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark: he has an excellent sense of taste. Taste-buds are produced in the throat for the tongue-tip and dispersed evenly.</p>

<p><span class="parno">98</span>Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He is rarely ill or unwell. His stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He is rarely ill or unwell. His stomach digests well, being neither too hot nor too cold, but just right, and fit for meditation. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">99</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">100</span>
	“Not with fist or rod or stone, <br>
	or sword or beating to death, <br>
	or by bondage or threats <br>
	did he ever harm anyone.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">101</span>
	For that very reason he rejoiced in heaven after passing away, <br>
	finding happiness as a fruit of happy deeds. <br>
	With taste-buds well formed and even, <br>
	on his return here he has an excellent sense of taste.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">102</span>
	That’s why the clever visionaries said: <br>
	‘This man will have much happiness <br>
	as householder or renunciate. <br>
	That’s the meaning shown by this mark.’”</p>

<h2>21–22. Deep Blue Eyes </h2>

<p><span class="parno">103</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. When looking at others he didn’t glare, look askance, or avert his eyes. Being straightforward, he reached out to others with straightforward intentions, looking at people with kindly eyes. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained these two marks: his eyes are deep blue, and he has eyelashes like a cow’s.</p>

<p><span class="parno">104</span>Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? The people look on him with kindly eyes. He is dear and beloved to the brahmins and householders, people of town and country, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, counselors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? The people look on him with kindly eyes. He is dear and beloved to the monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, demons, dragons, and fairies. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">105</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">106</span>
	“With not a glare or glance askance, <br>
	nor averting of the eyes; <br>
	straightforward, he reached out straightforwardly, <br>
	looking at people with kindly eyes.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">107</span>
	In good rebirths he enjoyed the fruit <br>
	and result, rejoicing there. <br>
	But here he has a cow’s eyelashes, <br>
	and eyes deep blue so fair to see.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">108</span>
	Many soothsayers, men clever <br>
	and learned in prognostic texts, <br>
	expert in cow-like lashes, indicated he’d <br>
	be looked upon with kindly eyes.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">109</span>
	Even as a householder he’d be regarded kindly, <br>
	beloved of the people. <br>
	But if he becomes an ascetic, not lay, <br>
	as destroyer of sorrow he’ll be loved by many.”</p>


<h2>23. Head Like a Turban </h2>

<p><span class="parno">110</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He was the leader and forerunner of people in skillful behaviors such as good conduct by way of body, speech, giving and sharing, taking precepts, observing the sabbath, paying due respect to mother and father, ascetics and brahmins, honoring the elders in the family, and various other things pertaining to skillful behaviors. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark: his head is shaped like a turban.</p>

<p><span class="parno">111</span>Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king?

That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He has a large following of monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, demons, dragons, and fairies. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">112</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">113</span>
	“Among people of good conduct, he was the leader, <br>
	devoted to a life of principle among the principled. <br>
	The people followed him, <br>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">114</span>
	Having experienced that fruit, <br>
	he acquires a head shaped like a turban. <br>
	The experts in omens and signs prophesied: <br>
	‘He will be leader of the people.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">115</span>
	Among people then, as before, <br>
	they will bring presents for him. <br>
	If he becomes an aristocrat, ruler of the land, <br>
	he’ll gain the service of the people.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">116</span>
	But if that man goes forth, <br>
	he’ll be sophisticated, proficient in the teachings. <br>
	Devoted to the virtues of his instruction, <br>

<h2>24–25. One Hair Per Pore, and a Tuft </h2>

<p><span class="parno">117</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He refrained from lying. He spoke the truth and stuck to the truth. He was honest and trustworthy, and didn’t trick the world with his words. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained these two marks: his hairs grow one per pore, and between his eyebrows there grows a tuft, soft and white like cotton-wool.</p>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">121</span>
	A tuft so very white like cotton-wool <br>

	And never two, but only one, <br>
	hair grew in each of his pores.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">122</span>
	Many soothsayers learned in marks <br>

<h2>26–27. Forty Gapless Teeth </h2>

<p><span class="parno">124</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He refrained from divisive speech. He didn’t repeat in one place what he heard in another so as to divide people against each other.

That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He has a persuasive voice. His words are persuasive to monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, demons, dragons, and fairies. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">133</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">134</span>
	“He never spoke a loud harsh word, <br>
	insulting, quarrelsome, <br>
	causing harm, rude, crushing the people. <br>
	His speech was sweet, helpful, and kind.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">135</span>
	He uttered words dear to the mind, <br>
	going to the heart, pleasing to the ear. <br>
	He enjoyed the fruit of his good verbal conduct, <br>
	experiencing the fruit of good deeds in heaven.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">136</span>
	Having experienced that fruit, <br>
	on his return to here he acquired the voice of Brahmā. <br>
	His tongue was long and wide, <br>
	and his speech was persuasive.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">137</span>
	Even as householder his speech brings prosperity. <br>
	But if that man goes forth, <br>
	speaking often to the people, <br>
	they’ll be persuaded by his fair words.”</p>

<h2>30. A Lion-Like Jaw </h2>

<p><span class="parno">138</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He refrained from talking nonsense. His words were timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. He said things at the right time which were valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial. Due to performing those deeds he was reborn in a heavenly realm. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained this mark: his jaw is like that of a lion.</p>

<p><span class="parno">139</span>Possessing this mark, if he stays at home he becomes a wheel-turning monarch. And what does he obtain as king? He can’t be destroyed by any human foe or enemy. That’s what he obtains as king. And what does he obtain as Buddha? He can’t be destroyed by any foe or enemy whether internal or external; nor by greed, hate, or delusion; nor by any ascetic or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or by anyone in the world. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">140</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">141</span>
	“Neither nonsensical nor silly, <br>
	his way of speaking was never loose. <br>
	He eliminated what was useless, <br>
	and spoke for the welfare and happiness of the people.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">142</span>
	So doing he passed from here to be reborn in heaven, <br>
	where he enjoyed the fruit of deeds well done. <br>
	Passing away, on his return to here, <br>
	he gained a jaw like the finest of beasts.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">143</span>
	He became a king so very hard to defeat, <br>
	a mighty lord and ruler of men. <br>
	He was equal to the best in the city of the Three and Thirty, <br>
	like Inda, the finest of gods.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">144</span>
	One such as that is not easily beaten by fairies, <br>
	demons, spirits, monsters, or gods. <br>
	If he becomes of such a kind, <br>
	he illuminates the quarters and in-between.”</p>

<h2>31–32. Even and White Teeth </h2>

<p><span class="parno">145</span>“Mendicants, in some past lives the Realized One was reborn as a human being. He gave up wrong livelihood and earned a living by right livelihood. He refrained from falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence. Due to performing, accumulating, heaping up, and amassing those deeds, when his body broke up, after death, he was reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm. There he surpassed the other gods in ten respects: divine life span, beauty, happiness, glory, sovereignty, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, and touches. When he came back to this state of existence he obtained these two marks: his teeth are even and perfectly white.</p>

<p><span class="parno">146</span>Possessing these marks, if he stays at home he becomes a king, a wheel-turning monarch, a just and principled king. His dominion extends to all four sides, he achieves stability in the country, and he possesses the seven treasures. He has the following seven treasures: the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the treasurer, and the counselor as the seventh treasure. He has over a thousand sons who are valiant and heroic, crushing the armies of his enemies. After conquering this land girt by sea — free of harassment by bandits, successful and prosperous, safe, blessed, and untroubled — he reigns by principle, without rod or sword. And what does he obtain as king? His retinue is pure. This includes brahmins and householders, people of town and country, treasury officials, military officers, guardsmen, ministers, counselors, rulers, tax beneficiaries, and princes. That’s what he obtains as king.</p>

<p><span class="parno">147</span>But if he goes forth from the lay life to homelessness, he becomes a perfected one, a fully awakened Buddha, who draws back the veil from the world. And what does he obtain as Buddha? His retinue is pure. This includes monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen, gods, humans, demons, dragons, and fairies. That’s what he obtains as Buddha.” That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p><span class="parno">148</span>On this it is said:</p>

<hr>

	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">149</span>
	“He abandoned wrong livelihood, and created <br>
	a way of life that’s fair, pure, and just. <br>
	He eliminated what was useless, <br>
	and lived for the welfare and happiness of the people.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">150</span>
	Having done what’s praised by the clever, the wise, and the good, <br>
	that man experienced the fruit in heaven. <br>
	Equal to the best in the heaven of Three and Thirty, <br>
	he enjoyed himself with pleasure and play.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">151</span>
	From there he passed back to a human life. <br>
	With the remaining ripening of the fruit of good deeds, <br>
	he obtained teeth that are even, <br>
	gleaming, bright, and white.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">152</span>
	Many soothsayers regarded as wise men <br>
	gathered and predicted of him: <br>
	‘With twice-born teeth so even, so white, so clean and bright <br>
	his retinue will be so pure.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">153</span>
	As king, his people will also be pure, <br>
	when he rules having conquered this earth so broad. <br>
	They won’t harm the country, <br>
	but will live for the welfare and happiness of the people.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">154</span>
	But if he goes forth he’ll be an ascetic free of ill, <br>
	his passions quelled, the veil drawn back. <br>
	Rid of stress and weariness, <br>
	he sees this world and the next.</p>
	
	<p class="verse"><span class="parno">155</span>
	Those who do his bidding, both lay and renunciate, <br>
	shake off wickedness, impure and blameworthy. <br>
	He’s surrounded by pure people, who dispel <br>
	stains, callousness, sin, and corruptions.’”</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">156</span>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said.</p>
