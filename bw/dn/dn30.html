<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n939"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.939] This Sutta may seem the most uninteresting and unedifying of the entire Nikāya. Yet, properly considered, it has its interest, first, as an example of the forms Buddhist propaganda was perhaps sometimes obliged to assume, and also from the point of view of iconography, as some of the marks came to be depicted in images of the Buddha: the great reclining Buddha-figure in Wat Pho in Bangkok is a well-known example. RD has a wide-ranging introduction tracing the possible origins of such marks, which clearly must have been important in the minds of influential Brahmins in the time of the Buddha (see, e.g. <a href="dn3.html">DN 3</a>). However, later Brahmin tradition has preserved very little about them. Certainly, many of them seem quite arbitrary and even difficult to distinguish clearly. Nevertheless, there are more traces of their influence in later Buddhist writing (and, as observed, iconography) than RD is anxious to admit, and there are even 'eighty minor marks' mentioned in addition to the thirty-two major ones here listed. Both lists, major and minor, are found in the Dharma-Samigraha (ed. Kenjiu Kasawara and F. Max Müller, 1885, rep. Delhi 1981), carefully collated with the lists as they occur in the present Sutta and elsewhere. RD remarks that 'most of the marks are so absurd, considered as marks of any human, that they are probably mythological in origin, and three or four seem to be solar.' He adds that 'our Suttanta seems gravely ironical in the contrast it makes between the absurdity of the marks and the beauty of the ethical qualities they are supposed, in the Suttanta, to mean.' But it must be added that, however absurdly as regards the details, they are intended to show the relation between action and karmic result, and they could have been used pedagogically to inculcate this lesson. Scholars are agreed on the fairly obvious fact that this is one of the latest texts in the Nikaya, and this is even hinted at in the commentary itself. The verses, ascribed to Ananda, show an exceptionally wide variety of metres, but all of late types. It is possible that someone tried to give this unpromising material some literary grace by dexterous versification. I considered trying to reproduce the different metrical forms in translation, but decided this was beyond my powers. Perhaps some other translator will attempt this one day.</span></span></span> Once the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī, in Jetavana, Anathapindikaʹs park. 'Monks!' he said, and the monks replied: 'Lord.' The Lord said:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>'There are, monks, these thirty-two marks peculiar to a Great Man,<span class="note" id="n940"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.940] <i>Mahāpurisa.</i> Though a 'Great Man', endowed with very special qualities, the Buddha as born on earth is still a man. Cf. <a href="dn28.html#n892">n.892.</a></span></span></span> and for that Great Man who possesses them, only two careers are open. If he lives the household life, he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures. These are: the Wheel Treasure, the Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman Treasure, the Householder Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor Treasure. He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law. But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, he will become an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, who has drawn back the veil from the world.</p>

<h3>Graceful Tread</h3>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>'Monks, in whatever former life, former existence or dwelling-place the Tathagata, being born a human being, undertook mighty deeds to good purpose, unwavering in good conduct of body, speech and thought, in generosity, self-discipline, observance of the fast-day, in honouring parents, ascetics and Brahmins and the head of the clan, and in other highly meritorious acts; by performing that kamma, heaping it up, lavishly and abundantly, at the breaking-up of the body after death he was reborn in a happy state, in a heavenly world, where he was endowed beyond other devas in ten respects: in length of heavenly life, beauty, happiness, splendour, influence, and in heavenly sights, sounds, smells, tastes and contacts. Falling away from there and coming to be reborn here on earth, he acquired this mark of the Great Man: feet with level tread, so that he places his foot evenly on the ground, lifts it evenly, and touches the ground evenly with the entire sole.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>'Being endowed with this mark, if he keeps to the household life, he will become a wheel-turning monarch…Conquering without stick or sword, but by justice, he rules over this earth as far as its ocean-boundaries, a land open, uninfested by brigands, free from jungle, powerful, prosperous, happy and free from perils. As a ruler, how does he benefit? He cannot be impeded by any human foe with ill-intent. That is his benefit as a ruler. And if he goes forth into homelessness, he will become a fully-enlightened Buddha … As such, how does he benefit? He has a large retinue: he is surrounded by monks, nuns, male and female lay-followers, devas and humans, asuras, nāgas and gandhabbas. That is his benefit as a Buddha.’ This was what the Lord declared.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>About this it was said:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>'Truthful, righteous, tamed and stilled,
<br>Pure and virtuous, keeping fasts,
<br>Generous, harming none, at peace
<br>He undertook this mighty task,</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>And at his end to heaven went,
<br>To dwell in joy and happiness.
<br>Returned from there to earth, his feet
<br>With level tread did touch the ground.</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Assembled augurs then declared:
<br>"For him who level treads the ground,
<br>No obstacles can bar his path,
<br>If he leads the household life,
<br>Or if he leaves the world behind:</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>This the mark does clearly show.
<br>If a layman, no adversary,
<br>No foe can stand before him.
<br>No human power exists that can
<br>Deprive him of his kamma's fruit.</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>Or if the homeless life's his choice:

That is his benefit as a ruler. And if he goes forth into homelessness, he will become a fully-enlightened Buddha…As such, how does he benefit?

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>'Being endowed with these marks, if he keeps to the household life,…as a ruler, how does he benefit?

He is long-lived … ; no foe, whether an ascetic or Brahmin, a deva, mara or Brahma, or anyone in the world can possibly take his life. That is his benefit as a Buddha.'
