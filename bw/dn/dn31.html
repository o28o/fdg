Alternatively called (as by RD) Sigālovāda Suttanta ‘The Sigala Homily’.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<section class="raw_sutta">  <!-- English and Pali -->
<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>This is what I heard. On one occasion, the Buddha was living near the town of Rājagaha at a spot in the Bamboo Grove called the Squirrel's Feeding Place.</p>

<hr>
<p>At that time a young householder named Sigālaka arose early and set out from Rājagaha with freshly washed clothes and hair. With palms together held up in reverence, he was paying respect towards the six directions: that is east, south, west, north, lower and upper.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Meanwhile the Buddha dressed himself in the early morning, took his bowl and robe and went in to Rājagaha on alms round. On the way, he saw Sigālaka worshipping the six directions. Seeing this, the Buddha said to him: "Young man, why have you risen in the early morning and set out from Rājagaha to worship in such a way?"</p>

<p>"Dear sir, my father on his deathbed urged me, 'My son, you must worship the directions'. So, dear sir, realizing, honoring, respecting, and holding sacred my father's request, I have risen in the early morning and set out from Rājagaha to worship in this way."</p>

<h3>Six Directions</h3>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"But, young man, that is not how the six directions should be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble ones."</p>

<p>"Then how, dear sir, should the six directions be worshipped according to the discipline of the noble ones? I would appreciate it if you would teach me the proper way this should be done."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Very well, young man, listen and pay careful attention while I tell you."</p>

<p>"Yes, dear sir," agreed Sigālaka.</p>

<p>The Buddha said this:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Young man, by abandoning the four impure actions,<span class="note" id="n973"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.973] <i>Kamma-kilesa.</i> </span></span></span> a noble disciple refrains from harmful deeds rooted in four causes and avoids the six ways of squandering wealth.<span class="note" id="n974"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.974] <i>Apāya-mukhāni:</i> cf. <a href="dn3.html#n158">n.158.</a> </span></span></span> So, these fourteen harmful things are removed. The noble disciple, now with the six directions protected, has entered upon a path for conquering both worlds, firmly grounded in this world and the next. At the dissolution of the body after death, a good rebirth occurs in a heavenly world.</p>

<h3>Impure Actions</h3>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"What four impure actions are abandoned? The harming of living beings is an impure action, taking what is not given is an impure action, sexual misconduct is an impure action, and false speech is an impure action. These four are abandoned."</p>

<hr>
<p>That is what the Buddha said.</p>

<p>Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:<span class="note" id="n975"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.975] The expression is awkward in English, suggesting that the Well-Farer and the Teacher are two different persons, which is of course nonsense. Contrast this formula with that used before the verse-passages in DN 30, where the verses are ascribed to Ananda.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p7" class="verse"><span class="parno">7</span>"Harming living beings, taking what is not given,
<br>False speech, and pursuing the loved one of another:
<br>These the wise surely do not praise."</p>

<h3>Causes of Harm</h3>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"What are the four causes of harmful deeds? Going astray through desire, hatred, delusion, or fear, the noble disciple does harmful deeds. But, young man, not going astray through desire, hatred, delusion, or fear, the noble disciple does not perform harmful deeds."</p>

<hr>
<p>That is what the Buddha said. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>

<p id="p9" class="verse"><span class="parno">9</span>"Desire, hatred, delusion, or fear:
<br>Whoever transgresses the Dhamma by these,
<br>Has a reputation that comes to ruin,
<br>Like the moon in the waning fortnight.</p>

<p id="p10" class="verse"><span class="parno">10</span>"Desire, hatred, delusion, or fear:
<br>Whoever transgresses not the Dhamma by these,
<br>Has a reputation that comes to fullness,
<br>Like the moon in the waxing fortnight."</p>

<h3>Squandering Wealth</h3>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"And what six ways of squandering wealth are to be avoided? Young man, heedlessness caused by intoxication, roaming the streets at inappropriate times, habitual partying, compulsive gambling, bad companionship, and laziness are the six ways of squandering wealth.</p>

<h3>Dangers of Drunkenness</h3>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"These are the six dangers inherent in heedlessness caused by intoxication: loss of immediate wealth, increased quarreling, susceptibility to illness, disrepute, indecent exposure, and weakened insight.</p>

<h3>Roaming the Streets</h3>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"These are the six dangers inherent in roaming the streets at inappropriate times: oneself, one's family, and one's property are all left unguarded and unprotected; one is suspected of crimes;<span class="note" id="n976"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.976] Crimes committed by others are laid at one’s door.</span></span></span> then rumors spread; and one is subjected to many miseries.</p>

<h3>Dangers in Carousing</h3>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"These are the six dangers inherent in habitual partying: You constantly seek, 'Where's the dancing? Where's the singing? Where's the music? Where are the stories? Where's the applause?<span class="note" id="n977"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.977] Cf. DN 1.1.13.</span></span></span> Where's the drumming?'</p>

<h3>Dangers in Gambling</h3>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"These are the six dangers inherent in compulsive gambling: winning breeds resentment; the loser mourns lost property; savings are lost; one's word carries no weight in a public forum; friends and colleagues display their contempt; and one is not sought after for marriage,<span class="note" id="n978"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.978] Because a gambler cannot support a wife properly.</span></span></span> since a gambler cannot adequately support a family.</p>

<h3>Dangers of Bad Companionship</h3>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"These are the six dangers inherent in bad companionship: any rogue, drunkard, addict, cheat, swindler, or thug becomes a friend and colleague.</p>

<h3>Dangers of Laziness</h3>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"These are the six dangers inherent in laziness: saying, 'It's too cold,' one does not work; saying, 'It's too hot,' one does not work; saying, 'It's too late,' one does not work; saying, 'It's too early,' one does not work; saying, 'I 'm too hungry,' one does not work; saying, 'I 'm too full,' one does not work. With an abundance of excuses for not working, new wealth does not accrue and existing wealth goes to waste."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>That is what the Buddha said. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>

<p id="p19" class="verse"><span class="parno">19</span>"Some are drinking buddies,
<br>Some say, 'Dear friend! Dear friend!'.
<br>But whoever in hardship stands close by,
<br>That one truly is a friend.</p>

<p id="p20" class="verse"><span class="parno">20</span>"Sleeping late, adultery,
<br>Hostility, meaninglessness,
<br>Harmful friends, utter stinginess:
<br>These six things destroy a person.</p>

<p id="p21" class="verse"><span class="parno">21</span>"Bad friends, bad companions,
<br>Bad practices—spending time in evil ways,
<br>By these, one brings oneself to ruin,
<br>In this world and the next.</p>

<p id="p22" class="verse"><span class="parno">22</span>"Seduction, gambling, drinking, singing, dancing,
<br>Sleeping by day, wandering all around untimely,
<br>Harmful friends, utter stinginess:
<br>These things destroy a person.</p>

<p id="p23" class="verse"><span class="parno">23</span>"They play with dice; they drink spirits;
<br>They consort with lovers dear to others.
<br>Associating with low-life and not the esteemed,
<br>They come to ruin like the waning moon.</p>

<p id="p24" class="verse"><span class="parno">24</span>"Whoever is a drunkard, broke, and destitute,
<br>Dragged by thirst from bar to bar,
<br>Sinking into debt like a stone in water
<br>Into bewilderment quickly plunges.</p>

<p id="p25" class="verse"><span class="parno">25</span>"When sleeping late becomes a habit
<br>And night is seen as time to rise,
<br>For one perpetually intoxicated,
<br>A home life cannot be maintained.</p>

<p id="p26" class="verse"><span class="parno">26</span>"'Too cold! Too hot!
<br>Too late!': they say.
<br>Having wasted work time this way,
<br>The young miss out on opportunities.</p>

<p id="p27" class="verse"><span class="parno">27</span>"For one regarding cold and hot
<br>As not more than blades of grass,
<br>Doing whatever should be done,
<br>Happiness will not be a stranger."<span class="note" id="n979"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.979] Cf. Thag 74.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>False Friends</h3>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>"Young man, be aware of these four enemies disguised as friends: the taker, the talker, the flatterer, and the reckless companion.</p>

<p><span class="parno">29–31</span>"The taker can be identified by four things: by only taking, asking for a lot while giving little, performing duty out of fear, and offering service in order to gain something.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>"The talker can be identified by four things: by reminding of past generosity, promising future generosity, mouthing empty words of kindness, and protesting personal misfortune when called on to help.<span class="note" id="n980"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.980] If you want a cart, he has just lost a wheel, and so on.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>"The flatterer can be identified by four things: by supporting both bad and good behavior indiscriminately, praising you to your face, and putting you down behind your back.</p>

<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>"The reckless companion can be identified by four things: by accompanying you in drinking, roaming around at night, partying, and gambling."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>That is what the Buddha said. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>


<p id="p36" class="verse"><span class="parno">36</span>"The friend who is all take,
<br>The friend of empty words,
<br>The friend full of flattery,
<br>And the reckless friend;</p>

<p id="p37" class="verse"><span class="parno">37</span>"These four are not friends, but enemies;
<br>The wise understand this
<br>And keep them at a distance
<br>As they would a dangerous path."</p>

<h3>True Friends</h3>

<p id="p38"><span class="parno">38</span>"Young man, be aware of these four good-hearted friends:<span class="note" id="n981"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.981] <i>Suhadā:</i> ‘good-hearted’, or ‘sound at heart’ (RD).</span></span></span> the helper, the friend who endures in good times and bad, the mentor, and the compassionate friend.</p>

<p id="p39"><span class="parno">39</span>"The helper can be identified by four things: by protecting you when you are vulnerable,<span class="note" id="n982"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.982] If you are drunk, etc. (DA!).</span></span></span> and likewise your wealth, being a refuge when you are afraid, and in various tasks providing double what is requested.</p>

<p id="p40"><span class="parno">40</span>"The enduring friend can be identified by four things: by telling you secrets, guarding your own secrets closely, not abandoning you in misfortune, and even dying for you.</p>

<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>"The mentor can be identified by four things: by restraining you from wrongdoing, guiding you towards good actions, telling you what you ought to know, and showing you the path to heaven.</p>

<p id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>"The compassionate friend can be identified by four things: by not rejoicing in your misfortune, delighting in your good fortune, preventing others from speaking ill of you, and encouraging others who praise your good qualities."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>That is what the Buddha said. Summing up in verse, the sublime teacher said:</p>

<p id="p44" class="verse"><span class="parno">44</span>"The friend who is a helper,
<br>The friend through thick and thin,
<br>The friend who gives good counsel,
<br>And the compassionate friend;</p>

<p id="p45" class="verse"><span class="parno">45</span>"These four are friends indeed,
<br>The wise understand this
<br>And attend on them carefully,
<br>Like a mother her own child.
<br>"The wise endowed with virtue
<br>Shine forth like a burning fire,</p>

<p id="p46" class="verse">.Gathering wealth as bees do honey
<br>And heaping it up like an ant hill.
<br>Once wealth is accumulated,
<br>Family and household life may follow.</p>

<p id="p47" class="verse"><span class="parno">47</span>"By dividing wealth into four parts,
<br>True friendships are bound;</p>

<p id="p48" class="verse"><span class="parno">48</span>One part should be enjoyed;
<br>Two parts invested in business;
<br>And the fourth set aside
<br>Against future misfortunes."</p>

<h3>Protecting the Six Directions</h3>

<p id="p49"><span class="parno">49</span>"And how, young man, does the noble disciple protect the six directions? These six directions should be known: mother and father as the east, teachers as the south,<span class="note" id="n983"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.983] A pun on <i>dakkhina</i> ‘right hand, south’, and <i>dakkhiṇā</i> ‘fee or offering to teacher’.</span></span></span> spouse and family as the west, friends and colleagues as the north, workers and servants as the lower direction, and ascetics and Brahmans as the upper direction.</p>

<p id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>"In five ways should a mother and father as the eastern direction be respected by a child: 'I will support them who supported me; I will do my duty to them; I will maintain the family lineage and tradition; I will be worthy of my inheritance; and I will make donations on behalf of dead ancestors.'<span class="note" id="n984"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.984] The last is omitted by RD.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>"And, the mother and father so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways: by restraining you from wrongdoing, guiding you towards good actions, training you in a profession, supporting the choice of a suitable spouse, and in due time, handing over the inheritance.</p>

<p>"In this way, the eastern direction is protected and made peaceful and secure.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p51"><span class="parno">51</span>"In five ways should teachers as the southern direction be respected by a student: by rising for them, regularly attending lessons, eagerly desiring to learn, duly serving them, and receiving instruction.</p>

<p>"And, teachers so respected reciprocate with compassion in five ways: by training in self-discipline, ensuring the teachings are well-grasped, instructing in every branch of knowledge, introducing their friends and colleagues, and providing safeguards in every direction.</p>

<p>"In this way, the southern direction is protected and made peaceful and secure.</p>

<p id="p52"><span class="parno">52</span>"In five ways should a wife as the western direction be respected by a husband: by honoring, not disrespecting, being faithful, sharing authority, and by giving gifts.</p>

<p>"And, the wife so respected reciprocates with compassion in five ways: by being well-organized, being kindly disposed to the in-laws and household workers, being faithful, looking after the household goods, and being skillful and diligent in all duties.</p>

<hr>
