<section class="raw_sutta">  <!-- English and Pali -->
<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. Once the Lord was touring in the Malla country with a large company of about five hundred monks. Arrived at Pāvā, the Mallas' capital, he stayed in the mango-grove of Cunda the smith.<span class="note" id="n1012"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1012] This is undoubtedly a late Sutta. RD with characteristic caution says of this and DN 34: 'They contain here and there matter which suggests that they took their present shape at a later date than the bulk of the rest of the Digha'. It is associated, like DN 29, with the time immediately following the death of the Nigantha Nātaputta, the Jain leader, and it is located 'in the mango-grove of Cunda the smith', known to us from DN 16.4.14ff. If we compare DN 29, we find that that discourse is addressed to 'the novice Cunda', who is quite a different character — but we may wonder whether the two have not become confused. Part of the inspiration of DN 34 may have come from the Buddha’s words at DN 29.17. Could the whole Sutta have been expanded from that nucleus? In any case the method of listing items in expanding numerical groups was used (whether earlier or later) on a large scale in the Aṅguttara Nikāya, and in fact quite a number of entries in the lists in this Sutta appear there too.Such numerical listing has also been compared by different writers from RD onwards to the so-called 'matrices' <i>(mātikā)</i> of the Abhidhamma — partly with the implication that this type of presentation always represents a stratum considerably later than the Buddha’s time. In fact we do not know to what extent the Buddha himself resorted to the obvious pedagogic device of teaching 'by numbers'. In any case, when such numerical lists were in existence, they readily lent themselves to expansion, and it is likely that the material of this Sutta dates from a variety of periods, and because some of it is obviously late, this does not mean that other parts are not early. There are in existence Tibetan and other versions. It should perhaps be stressed that, arid as this type of Sutta may appear to many today, it is from the monastic point of view valuable for use in chanting (its ostensible – and probably real — original object), incorporating as it does not only the major doctrinal categories in brief, but many points on behaviour and discipline which monks should constantly bear in mind.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">N.B. Since the lists in this and DN 34 consist largely of technical terms, the Pali words have been given wherever confusion or doubt seemed possible.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Now at that time a new meeting-hall of the Mallas of Pāvā, called Ubbhaṭaka,<span class="note" id="n1013"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1013] The lofty ('Thrown-aloft-er', RD).</span></span></span> had recently been built, and it had not yet been occupied by any ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. Hearing that the Lord was staying in Cunda's mango-grove, the Mallas of Pāvā went to see him. Having saluted him, they sat down to one side and said: 'Lord, the Mallas of Pāvā have recently erected a new meeting-hall called Ubbhataka, and it has not yet been occupied by any ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. May the Blessed Lord be the first to use it! Should he do so, that would be for the lasting good and happiness of the Mallas of Pāvā.′ And the Lord consented by silence.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Noting his assent, the Mallas rose, saluted him, passed out to his right and went to the meeting-hall. They spread mats all round, arranged seats, put out a water-pot and an oil-lamp, and then, returning to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side and reported what they had done, saying: 'Whenever the Blessed Lord is ready.'</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the Lord dressed, took his robe and bowl, and went to the meeting-hall with his monks. There he washed his feet, entered the hall and sat down against the central pillar, facing east. The monks, having washed their feet, entered the hall and sat down along the western wall facing east, with the Lord in front of them. The Pāvā Mallas washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat down along the eastern wall facing west, with the Lord in front of them. Then the Lord spoke to the Mallas on Dhamma till far into the night, instructing, inspiring, firing and delighting them. Then he dismissed them, saying: 'Vāsetthas,<span class="note" id="n1014"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1014] This is the family-name (cf., <a href="dn6.html#n179">n.179</a>). The Mallas of Pāvā were, of course, closely related to those of Kusinārāā.</span></span></span> the night has passed away.<span class="note" id="n1015"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1015] Not 'lovely is the night' (an odd mistranslation of a stock phrase by RD).</span></span></span> Now do as you think fit.' 'Very good, Lord', replied the Mallas. And they got up, saluted the Lord, and went out, passing him by on the right.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>As soon as the Mallas had gone the Lord, surveying the monks sitting silently all about, said to the Venerable Sāriputta: 'The monks are free from sloth-and-torpor,<span class="note" id="n1016"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1016] The third of the five hindrances (below, 2.1 (6)).</span></span></span> Sāriputta. You think of a discourse on Dhamma to give to them. My back aches, I want to stretch it.' 'Very good, Lord', replied Sāriputta.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Then the Lord, having folded his robe in four, lay down on his right side in the lion-posture,<span class="note" id="n1017"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1017] As at <a href="dn16.html#465">DN16</a>.</span></span></span> with one foot on the other, mindful and clearly aware, and bearing in mind the time to arise.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Now at that time the Nigantha Nātaputta had just died at Pāvā. And at his death the Niganthas were split into two parties, quarrelling and disputing, fighting and attacking each other with wordy warfare: 'You don't understand this doctrine and discipline — I do!' 'How could you understand this doctrine and discipline?' 'Your way is all wrong — mine is right!' 'I am consistent — you aren't!' 'You said last what you should have said first, and you said first what you should have said last!' 'What you took so long to think up has been refuted!' 'Your argument has been overthrown, you're defeated!' 'Go on, save your doctrine — get out of that if you can!' You would have thought the Niganthas, Nataputtaʹs disciples, were bent on killing each other. Even the white-robed lay followers were disgusted, displeased and repelled when they saw that their doctrine and discipline was so ill-proclaimed, so unedifyingly displayed, and so ineffectual in calming the passions, having been proclaimed by one not fully enlightened, and now with its support gone, without an arbiter.<span class="note" id="n"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i>Paṭisaraṇaṁ</i> 'a resort'.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>And the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, referring to this situation, and said: 'So ill-proclaimed was their teaching and discipline, so unedifyingly displayed, and so ineffectual in calming the passions, having been proclaimed by one who was not fully enlightened. <span class="pts_pn" id="mn.iii.211"></span> But, friends, this Dhamma has been well proclaimed by the Lord, the fully-enlightened One. And so we should all recite it together<span class="note" id="n1018"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1018] As proposed at <a href="dn29.html#17">DN29</a>.</span></span></span> without disagreement, so that this holy life may be enduring and established for a long time, thus to be for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare and happiness of devas and humans.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>And what is this Dhamma that has been well proclaimed by the Lord…?</p>

<h3>One Thing</h3>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>'There is one thing that was perfectly proclaimed by the Lord who knows and sees, the fully-enlightened Buddha. So we should all recite together … for the benefit, welfare and happiness of devas and humans.</p>

<hr>
<p>'What is this one thing?<span class="note" id="n1019"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1019] Or really, like the parallel following groups, '(set of) one thing'.</span></span></span> <i>(eko dhammo)</i>.</p>

On seeing an object with the eye, hearing a sound…, smelling a smell…, tasting a flavour…, touching a tangible object…, or cognising a mental object with the mind, he is neither pleased nor displeased, but remains equable, mindful and clearly aware; how has he established the one guard? By guarding his mind with mindfulness; what are the four supports? He judges that one thing is to be pursued, one thing endured, one thing avoided, one thing suppressed (as in <a href="#120"> verse 120</a>); how has he got rid of individual beliefs <i>(panunna-pacceka-sacco?)</i> Whatever individual beliefs are held by the majority of ascetics and Brahmins he has dismissed, abandoned, rejected, let go; how is he one who has quite abandoned quests? He has abandoned the quest for sense-desires, for rebirth, for the holy life;<span class="note" id="n1131"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1131] Getting involved in problems about 'self', etc.</span></span></span> how is he pure of motive? He has abandoned thoughts of sensuality, ill-will, cruelty; how is he one who has tranquillised his emotions <i>(passaddha-kaya-saṅkhāro hoti)</i>? Because, having given up pleasure and pain with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters into a state beyond pleasure and pain which is purified by equanimity, and this is the fourth jhāna; how is he well emancipated in heart? He is liberated from the thought of greed, hatred and delusion; how is he well liberated by wisdom? He understands: "For me greed, hatred and delusion are abandoned, cut off at the root, like a palm-tree stump, destroyed and incapable of growing again."</p>
