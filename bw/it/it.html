Other meanings for this term include shock, dismay, and alienation. In the Pali canon, this emotion is often accompanied by fear and a sensed need to escape from overwhelming danger. The things that should inspire urgency and awe are the first four of the five reflections listed in AN 5.57: "I am subject to aging, have not gone beyond aging. I am subject to illness, have not gone beyond illness. I am subject to death, have not gone beyond death. I will grow different, separate from all that is dear and appealing to me." Appropriate exertion is indicated by the fifth reflection: "I am the owner of my actions, heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have by actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir."</span></span></span> and, feeling urgency and awe, appropriate exertion.

But these beings — who were endowed with bodily good conduct, verbal good conduct, and mental good conduct; who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — at the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.'

From the world, the Tathagata is disjoined. The origination of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. The origination of the world has, by the Tathagata, been abandoned. The cessation of the world has been fully awakened to by the Tathagata. The cessation of the world has, by the Tathagata, been realized.

Thus he is called the Tathagata.</p>

<p id="p112-4"><span class="parno">4</span>"From the night the Tathagata fully awakens to the unsurpassed Right Self-awakening to the night he is totally unbound in the Unbinding property with no fuel remaining, whatever the Tathagata has said, spoken, explained is just so <span class="evam">(tatha)</span> and not otherwise.

<p class="verse" id="p112-7-13"><span class="parno">7-13</span>Directly knowing all the world, all the world as is really is, from all the world disjoined, in all the world unmatched: Conquering all in all ways, enlightened, released from all bonds, he touches the foremost peace — Unbinding, free from fear. He is free of fermentation, of trouble, awakened, his doubts cut through; has attained the ending of action, is released in the destruction of acquisitions. He is blessed, awakened, a lion, unsurpassed. In the world with its devas he set the Brahma-wheel going.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The Brahma-wheel = the Dhamma-wheel, the name of the Buddha’s first sermon, so called because it contains a "wheel" that lists all twelve permutations of two sets of variables: the four noble truths — suffering, its origination, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation — and the three levels of knowledge appropriate to each truth: knowledge of the truth, knowledge of the task appropriate to the truth, and knowledge that the task has been completed. This wheel constitutes the Buddha’s most central teaching</span></span></span> Thus divine and human beings who have gone to the Buddha for refuge, gathering, pay homage to the great one, thoroughly mature: 'Tamed, he's the best of those who can be tamed; calm, the seer of those who can be calmed; released, supreme among those who can be released; crossed, the foremost of those who can cross.' Thus they pay homage to the great one, thoroughly mature: 'In this world with its devas, there's no one to compare with you.'</p>
