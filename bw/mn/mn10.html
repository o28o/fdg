<section class="raw_sutta">  <!-- English and Pali -->
<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n133"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.133] This is one of the most important suttas in the Pali Canon, containing the most comprehensive statement of the most direct way to the attainment of the Buddhist goal. Virtually the identical sutta is found as well at <a href="../dn/dn22.html">DN22</a>, though with an expanded analysis of the Four Noble Truths attached, which accounts for its greater length. The sutta, its commentary, and copious extracts from its difficult but illuminating subcommentary have been presented together in translation by Soma Thera in <i>The Way of Mindfulness.</i> A very readable translation of the sutta, with a modern commentary excelling in clarity and depth, will be found in Nyanaponika Thera, <i>The Heart of Buddhist Meditation</i>.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Kuru country where there was a town of the Kurus named Kammāsadhamma.<span class="note" id="n134"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.134] This town is said by some scholars to have been in the vicinity of modern Delhi.</span></span></span> There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." — "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Bhikkhus, this is the direct path<span class="note" id="n135"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.135] The Pali reads <i>ekāyano ayaṁ bhikkhave maggo,</i> and virtually all translators understand this as a statement upholding <i>satipatṭ̣hāna</i> as an exclusive path. Thus Ven. Soma renders it: "This is the only way, O bhikkhus," and Ven. Nyanaponika: "This is the sole way, monks." Ñm, however, points out that ekāyana magga at <a href="../mn/mn12.html#37">MN12.37–42</a> has the unambiguous contextual meaning of "a path that goes in one way only," and so he rendered the phrase in this passage, too. The expression used here, "the direct path," is an attempt to preserve this meaning in a more streamlined phrasing. MA explains <i>ekāyana magga</i> as a single path, not a divided path; as a way that has to be walked by oneself alone, without a companion; and as a way that goes to one goal, Nibbāna. Though there is neither canonical nor commentarial basis for this view, it might be maintained that <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> is called <i>ekāyana magga,</i> the direct path, to distinguish it from the approach to meditative attainment that proceeds through the jhānas or <i>brahmavihāras.</i> While the latter can lead to Nibbāna, they do not do so necessarily but can lead to sidetracks, whereas <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> leads invariably to the final goal.</span></span></span> for the purification of beings, for the surmounting of sorrow and lamentation, for the disappearance of pain and grief, for the attainment of the true way, for the realisation of Nibbāna — namely, the four foundations of mindfulness.<span class="note" id="n136"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.136] The word <i>satipaṭṭhāna</i> is a compound term. The first part, sati, originally meant "memory," but in Pali Buddhist usage it far more frequently bears the meaning of attentiveness directed to the present — hence the makeshift rendering "mindfulness." The second part is explained in two ways: either as a shortened form of <i>upaṭṭhāna,</i> meaning "setting up" or "establishing" — here, of mindfulness; or as <i>paṭṭhāna,</i> meaning "domain" or "foundation" — again, of mindfulness. Thus the four <i>satipaṭṭhānas</i> may be understood as either the four ways of setting up mindfulness or as the four objective domains of mindfulness, to be amplified in the rest of the sutta. The former seems to be the etymologically correct derivation (confirmed by the Sanskrit <i>smṛtyupasthāna</i>), but the Pali commentators, while admitting both explanations, have a predilection for the latter.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"What are the four? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu<span class="note" id="n137"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.137] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> says that in this context, "bhikkhu" is a term indicating a person who earnestly endeavours to accomplish the practice of the teaching: "Whoever undertakes that practice … is here comprised under the term ‘bhikkhu.’"</span></span></span> abides contemplating the body as a body, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.<span class="note" id="n138"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.138] The repetition in the phrase "contemplating the body as a body" <i>(kāye kāyānupassī)</i>, according to <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA,</a> has the purpose of precisely determining the object of contemplation and of isolating that object from others with which it might be confused. Thus, in this practice, the body should be contemplated as such, and not one's feelings, ideas, and emotions concerning it. The phrase also means that the body should be contemplated simply as a body and not as a man, a woman, a self, or a living being. Similar considerations apply to the repetitions in the case of each of the other three foundations of mindfulness. "Covetousness and grief," MA says, stands for sensual desire and ill will, the principal hindrances that must be overcome for the practice to succeed, enumerated separately below in verse 36.</span></span></span> He abides contemplating feelings as feelings, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating mind as mind, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world. He abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, fully aware, and mindful, having put away covetousness and grief for the world.<span class="note" id="n139"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.139] The structure of this sutta is fairly simple. Following the preamble, the body of the discourse falls into four parts by way of the four foundations of mindfulness:</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">I. Contemplation of the body, which comprises fourteen exercises: mindfulness of breathing; contemplation of the four postures; full awareness; attention to foulness; attention to the elements; and nine "charnel ground contemplations" — reflection on corpses in different stages of decomposition.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">II. Contemplation of feeling, considered one exercise.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">III. Contemplation of mind, also one exercise.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">IV. Contemplation of mind-objects, which has five subdivisions — the five hindrances; the five aggregates; the six sense bases; the seven enlightenment factors; and the Four Noble Truths.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">Thus the sutta expounds altogether twenty-one exercises in contemplation. Each exercise in turn has two aspects: the basic exercise, explained first, and a supplementary section on insight (essentially the same for all the exercises), which indicates how the contemplation is to be developed to deepen understanding of the phenomenon under investigation.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">Finally the sutta concludes with a statement of assurance in which the Buddha personally vouches for the effectiveness of the method by declaring the fruits of continuous practice to be either arahantship or non-returning.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Contemplation of the Body</span></h3>

<h4><span class="add">1. Mindfulness of Breathing</span></h4>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu abide contemplating the body as a body? Here a bhikkhu, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, sits down; having folded his legs crosswise, set his body erect, and established mindfulness in front of him, ever mindful he breathes in, mindful he breathes out. Breathing in long, he understands: ‘I breathe in long’; or breathing out long, he understands: ‘I breathe out long.’ Breathing in short, he understands: ‘I breathe in short’; or breathing out short, he understands: ‘I breathe out short.’<span class="note" id="n140"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.140] The practice of mindfulness of breathing <i>(ānāpānasati)</i> involves no deliberate attempt to regulate the breath, as in hatha yoga, but a sustained effort to fix awareness on the breath as it moves in and out in its natural rhythm. Mindfulness is set up at the nostrils or the upper lip, wherever the impact of the breath is felt most distinctly; the length of the breath is noted but not consciously controlled. The complete development of this meditation method is expounded in <a href="mn118.html">MN&nbsp;118</a>. For a collection of texts on this subject, see Bhikkhu Ñāṅamoli, <a href="http://www.bps.lk/library-search-select.php?id=bp502s"><i>Mindfulness of Breathing.</i></a> See too Vsm VIII, 145–244.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in experiencing the whole body’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out experiencing the whole body.’<span class="note" id="n141"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.141] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains "experiencing the whole body" <i>(sabbakāyapaṭisaṁvedī )</i> as signifying that the meditator becomes aware of each in-breath and out-breath through its three phases of beginning, middle, and end. In the first edition I followed this explanation and added in brackets "of breath" after "the whole body." In retrospect, however, this interpretation seems forced, and I now prefer to take the phrase quite literally. It is also difficult to see how <i>paṭisamivedi</i> could mean "is aware of," as it is based on a verb meaning "to experience."</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>He trains thus: ‘I shall breathe in tranquillising the bodily formation’; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the mation’ ; he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation.’<span class="note" id="n142"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.142] The "bodily formation" <i>(kāyasaṅkhāra)</i> is defined at <a href="mn44.html#p19">MN&nbsp;44.13</a> as in-and-out breathing itself. Thus, as MA explains, with the successful development of the practice, the meditator's breathing becomes increasingly quiet, tranquil, and peaceful.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Just as a skilled lathe-operator or his apprentice, when making a long turn, understands: ‘I make a long turn’; or, when making a short turn, understands: ‘I make a short turn’; so too, breathing in long, a bhikkhu understands: ‘I breathe in long’ … he trains thus: ‘I shall breathe out tranquillising the bodily formation.’</p>

<h3><span class="add">Insight</span></h3>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, or he abides contemplating the body as a body externally, or he abides contemplating the body as a body both internally and externally.<span class="note" id="n143"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.143] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> "Internally": contemplating the breathing in his own body. "Externally": contemplating the breathing occurring in the body of another. "Internally and externally": contemplating the breathing in his own body and in the body of another alternately, with uninterrupted attention. A similar explanation applies to the refrain that follows each of the other sections, except that under the contemplation of feeling, mind, and mind-objects, the contemplation externally, apart from those possessing telepathic powers, must be inferential.</span></span></span> Or else he abides contemplating in the body its nature of arising, or he abides contemplating in the body its nature of vanishing, or he abides contemplating in the body its nature of both arising and vanishing.<span class="note" id="n144"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.144] The expression <i>samudayadhammānupassī kāyasmiṁ viharati</i> is usually translated "he abides contemplating in the body its arising factors" (as was done in the first edition), on the assumption that the compound contains a plural, <i>samudayadhammā.</i> A plural sense, however, is not mandatory, and it is more consistent with the use of the suffix -dhamma elsewhere to take it to mean "subject to" or "having the nature of" here as well. The commentarial explanation of the conditioning factors for each of the four foundations does not imply that the commentary understands <i>-dhamma</i> to mean the actual conditioning factors.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p"><a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that the arising nature <i>(samudayadhamma)</i> of the body can be observed in its conditioned origination through ignorance, craving, kamma, and food, as well as in the moment-by-moment origination of material phenomena in the body. In the case of mindfulness of breathing, an additional condition is the physiological apparatus of respiration. The "vanishing nature" <i>(vayadhamma )</i> of the body is seen in the cessation of bodily phenomena through the cessation of their conditions as well as in the momentary dissolution of bodily phenomena.</span></span></span> Or else mindfulness that ‘there is a body’ is simply established in him to the extent necessary for bare knowledge and mindfulness.<span class="note" id="n145"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.145] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> For the sake of a wider and wider and higher and higher measure of knowledge and mindfulness.</span></span></span> And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>

<h4><span class="add">2. The Four Postures</span></h4>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Again, bhikkhus, when walking, a bhikkhu understands: ‘I am walking’; when standing, he understands: ‘I am standing’; when sitting, he understands: ‘I am sitting’; when lying down, he understands: ‘I am lying down’; or he understands accordingly however his body is disposed.<span class="note" id="n146"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.146] The understanding of the bodily postures referred to in this exercise is not our ordinary natural knowledge of our bodily activity, but a close, constant, and careful awareness of the body in every position, coupled with an analytical examination intended to dispel the delusion of a self as the agent of bodily movement.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, externally, and both internally and externally … And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>

<h4><span class="add">3. Full Awareness</span></h4>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu is one who acts in full awareness when going forward and returning;<span class="note" id="n147"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.147] <i>Sampajañña,</i> also translated as "clear comprehension" (Soma, Nyanaponika), is analysed in the commentaries into four types: full awareness of the purpose of one's action; full awareness of the suitability of one's means; full awareness of the domain, that is, not abandoning the subject of meditation during one's daily routine; and full awareness of reality, the knowledge that behind one's activities there is no abiding self. See <i>The Way of Mindfulness,</i> pp. 60–100; <i>The Heart of Buddhist Meditation,</i> pp. 46–55.</span></span></span> who acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away; who acts in full awareness when flexing and extending his limbs; who acts in full awareness when wearing his robes and carrying his outer robe and bowl; who acts in full awareness when eating, drinking, consuming food, and tasting; who acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating; who acts in full awareness when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, and keeping silent.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, externally, and both internally and externally … And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>

<h4><span class="add">4. Foulness — The Bodily Parts</span></h4>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"Again, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this same body up from the soles of the feet and down from the top of the hair, bounded by skin, as full of many kinds of impurity thus: ‘In this body there are head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, contents of the stomach, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, spittle, snot, oil of the joints, and urine.’<span class="note" id="n148"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.148] In later Pali works the brain is added to the above list to form thirty-two parts. The details of this meditation practice are explained at Vsm VIII, 42–144.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>Just as though there were a bag with an opening at both ends full of many sorts of grain, such as hill rice, red rice, beans, peas, millet, and white rice, and a man with good eyes were to open it and review it thus: ‘This is hill rice, this is red rice, these are beans, these are peas, this is millet, this is white rice’; so too, a bhikkhu reviews this same body … as full of many kinds of impurity thus: ‘In this body there are head-hairs … and urine.’</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"In this way he abides contemplating the body as a body internally, externally, and both internally and externally … And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. That too is how a bhikkhu abides contemplating the body as a body.</p>
