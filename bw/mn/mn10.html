<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">

<p><span class="parno">1</span><span>So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the land of the Kurus, near the Kuru town named Kammāsadamma. There the Buddha addressed the mendicants: “Mendicants!”</p>
<p>“Venerable sir,” they replied. The Buddha said this:</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>“Mendicants, the four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the path to convergence. They are in order to purify sentient beings, to get past sorrow and crying, to make an end of pain and sadness, to end the cycle of suffering, and to realize extinguishment.</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>What four? It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of feelings — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of the mind — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world. They meditate observing an aspect of principles — keen, aware, and mindful, rid of desire and aversion for the world.</p>

<h4>1. Observing the Body <br>
1.1. Mindfulness of Breathing </h4>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the body?</p>

<p>It’s when a mendicant — gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut — sits down cross-legged, with their body straight, and focuses their mindfulness right there. </p>

<p>Just mindful, they breathe in. Mindful, they breathe out.</p>

<p>When breathing in heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing in heavily.’ When breathing out heavily they know: ‘I’m breathing out heavily.’ When breathing in lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing in lightly.’ When breathing out lightly they know: ‘I’m breathing out lightly.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>They practice breathing in experiencing the whole body. They practice breathing out experiencing the whole body.</p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>They practice breathing in stilling the body’s motion. They practice breathing out stilling the body’s motion.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>It’s like a deft carpenter or carpenter’s apprentice. When making a deep cut they know: ‘I’m making a deep cut,’ and when making a shallow cut they know: ‘I’m making a shallow cut.’</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<p>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<h5>1.2. The Postures </h5>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>Furthermore, when a mendicant is walking they know: ‘I am walking.’ When standing they know: ‘I am standing.’ When sitting they know: ‘I am sitting.’ And when lying down they know: ‘I am lying down.’ Whatever posture their body is in, they know it.</p>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<p>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<h5>1.3. Situational Awareness </h5>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>Furthermore, a mendicant acts with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.</p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … that too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<h5>1.4. Focusing on the Repulsive </h5>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, up from the soles of the feet and down from the tips of the hairs, wrapped in skin and full of many kinds of filth. ‘In this body there is head hair, body hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, undigested food, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, synovial fluid, urine.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>It’s as if there were a bag with openings at both ends, filled with various kinds of grains, such as fine rice, wheat, mung beans, peas, sesame, and ordinary rice. And someone with good eyesight were to open it and examine the contents: ‘These grains are fine rice, these are wheat, these are mung beans, these are peas, these are sesame, and these are ordinary rice.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally … that too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<h5>1.5. Focusing on the Elements </h5>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>Furthermore, a mendicant examines their own body, whatever its placement or posture, according to the elements: ‘In this body there is the earth element, the water element, the fire element, and the air element.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>It’s as if a deft butcher or butcher’s apprentice were to kill a cow and sit down at the crossroads with the meat cut into portions.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally …</p>

<p>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<h5>1.6. The Charnel Ground Contemplations </h5>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>Furthermore, suppose a mendicant were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground. And it had been dead for one, two, or three days, bloated, livid, and festering. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’</p>

<p>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground being devoured by crows, hawks, vultures, herons, dogs, tigers, leopards, jackals, and many kinds of little creatures. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’</p>

<p>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span>Furthermore, suppose they were to see a corpse discarded in a charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh and blood, held together by sinews …</p>

<p><span class="parno">22</span>A skeleton without flesh but smeared with blood, and held together by sinews …</p>

<p><span class="parno">23</span>A skeleton rid of flesh and blood, held together by sinews …</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">24</span>Bones rid of sinews scattered in every direction. Here a hand-bone, there a foot-bone, here a shin-bone, there a thigh-bone, here a hip-bone, there a rib-bone, here a back-bone, there an arm-bone, here a neck-bone, there a jaw-bone, here a tooth, there the skull …</p>

<p><span class="parno">25</span>White bones, the color of shells …</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">26</span>Decrepit bones, heaped in a pile …</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">27</span>Bones rotted and crumbled to powder. They’d compare it with their own body: ‘This body is also of that same nature, that same kind, and cannot go beyond that.’</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">28</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the body internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the body as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the body exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<hr>

<p>That too is how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the body.</p>

<h4>2. Observing the Feelings </h4>

<p><span class="parno">29</span>And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of feelings?</p>

<p>It’s when a mendicant who feels a pleasant feeling knows: ‘I feel a pleasant feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">30</span>When they feel a painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a painful feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">31</span>When they feel a neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a neutral feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">32</span>When they feel a material pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material pleasant feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">33</span>When they feel a spiritual pleasant feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual pleasant feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">34</span>When they feel a material painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material painful feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">35</span>When they feel a spiritual painful feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual painful feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">36</span>When they feel a material neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a material neutral feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">37</span>When they feel a spiritual neutral feeling, they know: ‘I feel a spiritual neutral feeling.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">38</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the feelings internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing feelings as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that feelings exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<p>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of feelings.</p>

<h4>3. Observing the Mind </h4>

<p><span class="parno">39-40</span>And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of the mind? It’s when a mendicant knows mind with greed as ‘mind with greed,’ and mind without greed as ‘mind without greed.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">41-42</span>They know mind with hate as ‘mind with hate,’ and mind without hate as ‘mind without hate.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">43-44</span>They know mind with delusion as ‘mind with delusion,’ and mind without delusion as ‘mind without delusion.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">45-46</span>They know constricted mind as ‘constricted mind,’ and scattered mind as ‘scattered mind.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">47-48</span>They know expansive mind as ‘expansive mind,’ and unexpansive mind as ‘unexpansive mind.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">49-50</span>They know mind that is not supreme as ‘mind that is not supreme,’ and mind that is supreme as ‘mind that is supreme.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">51-52</span>They know mind immersed in samādhi as ‘mind immersed in samādhi,’ and mind not immersed in samādhi as ‘mind not immersed in samādhi.’ </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">53-54</span>They know freed mind as ‘freed mind,’ and unfreed mind as ‘unfreed mind.’</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">55</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of the mind internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the mind as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that the mind exists, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<p>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of the mind.</p>

<h4>4. Observing Principles </h4>

<h5>4.1. The Hindrances </h5>

<p><span class="parno">56</span>And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles?</p>

<p>It’s when a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances. And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five hindrances?</p>

<p><span class="parno">57</span>It’s when a mendicant who has sensual desire in them understands: ‘I have sensual desire in me.’ When they don’t have sensual desire in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have sensual desire in me.’ They understand how sensual desire arises; how, when it’s already arisen, it’s given up; and how, once it’s given up, it doesn’t arise again in the future.</p>

<h5>4.2. The Aggregates </h5>

And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the five grasping aggregates? It’s when a mendicant contemplates: ‘Such is form, such is the origin of form, such is the ending of form. Such is feeling, such is the origin of feeling, such is the ending of feeling.

<h5>4.4. The Awakening Factors </h5>

<p><span class="parno">72</span>Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the seven awakening factors. And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the seven awakening factors?</p>

<hr>

<p>It’s when a mendicant who has the awakening factor of mindfulness in them understands: ‘I have the awakening factor of mindfulness in me.’ When they don’t have the awakening factor of mindfulness in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have the awakening factor of mindfulness in me.’ They understand how the awakening factor of mindfulness that has not arisen comes to arise; and how the awakening factor of mindfulness that has arisen becomes fulfilled by development.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">73-78</span>When they have the awakening factor of investigation of principles … energy … rapture … tranquility … immersion … equanimity in them, they understand: ‘I have the awakening factor of equanimity in me.’ When they don’t have the awakening factor of equanimity in them, they understand: ‘I don’t have the awakening factor of equanimity in me.’ They understand how the awakening factor of equanimity that has not arisen comes to arise; and how the awakening factor of equanimity that has arisen becomes fulfilled by development.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">79</span>And so they meditate observing an aspect of principles internally, externally, and both internally and externally. They meditate observing the principles as liable to originate, as liable to vanish, and as liable to both originate and vanish. Or mindfulness is established that principles exist, to the extent necessary for knowledge and mindfulness. They meditate independent, not grasping at anything in the world.</p>

<p>That’s how a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the seven awakening factors.</p>

<h5>4.5. The Truths </h5>

<p><span class="parno">80</span>Furthermore, a mendicant meditates by observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths.</p>

<p>And how does a mendicant meditate observing an aspect of principles with respect to the four noble truths? It’s when a mendicant truly understands: ‘This is suffering’ … ‘This is the origin of suffering’ … ‘This is the cessation of suffering’ … ‘This is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering.’</p>
