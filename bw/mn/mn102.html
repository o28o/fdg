<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n935"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.935] This sutta is a "middle length" counterpart of the longer Brahmajāla Sutta, included in the Dīgha Nikāya and published in translation with its commentaries in Bodhi, <a href="http://www.bps.lk/olib/bp/bp209s_Bodhi_All-Embracing-Net-of-Views.pdf"><i>Discourse on the All-Embracing Net of Views</i></a>. Detailed explanations for almost all the views mentioned in this sutta will be found in the Introduction and Part Two of that work. There exists a Tibetan translation of the Panācatraya Sūtra, the counterpart of this text belonging to the Mūlasarvāstivāda school, whose collections were preserved in Skt. This text is discussed by Peter Skilling at <i>Mahāsūtras II,</i> pp. 469–511. Skilling highlights the interesting contrasts between this version of the text and the Pali version.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sā̄vatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." — "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<h4><span class="add">Speculations About the Future</span></h4>

<p>"Bhikkhus, there are some recluses and brahmins who speculate about the future and hold views about the future, who assert various doctrinal propositions concerning the future.</p>

<p><span class="add"><b>i</b></span> Some assert thus: ‘The self is percipient and unimpaired after death.’</p>

<p><span class="add"><b>ii</b></span> Some assert thus: ‘The self is non-percipient and unimpaired after death.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="add"><b>iii</b></span> Some assert thus: ‘The self is neither percipient nor non-percipient and unimpaired after death.’</p>

<p><span class="add"><b>iv</b></span> Or they describe the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existing being <span class="add">at death</span>.</p>

The Brahmajāla Sutta places assertions of supreme Nibbāna here and now among views about the future, but the arrangement in the Tibetan counterpart seems to be more logical.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Thus <span class="add">a</span> they either describe an existing self that is unimpaired after death; <span class="add">b</span> or they describe the annihilation, destruction, and extermination of an existing being <span class="add">at death</span>; <span class="add">c</span> or they assert Nibbāna here and now.

However, it can also comprise all grosser mind-door cognitions as well. To enter the fourth immaterial attainment, all the ordinary "mental formations" involved in other cognitive processes must be overcome, for their persistence is an obstacle to entering this attainment. Hence it is called "not percipient" <i>(n’eva saññī)</i>.</span></span></span> For this base, it is declared, is not to be attained as an attainment with formations; this base, it is declared, is to be attained as an attainment with a residue of formations.<span class="note" id="n946"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.946] <i>Sasaṅkhārāvasesasamāpatti.</i> Within the fourth immaterial attainment a residue of extremely subtle mental formations remains.

Why is that? All these good recluses and brahmins, rushing onwards, assert their attachment thus: ‘We shall be thus after death, we shall be thus after death.’ Just as a merchant going to market thinks: ‘Through this, that will be mine; with this, I will get that’; so too, these good recluses and brahmins seem like merchants when they declare: ‘We shall be thus after death, we shall be thus after death.’</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Bhikkhus, any recluses or brahmins who speculate about the future and hold views about the future, who assert various doctrinal propositions concerning the future, all assert these five bases or a certain one among them.<span class="note" id="n949"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.949] So far only four of the original five classes of speculations about the future have been analysed, yet the Buddha speaks as if they were all explicated. MA tries to resolve the problem by explaining that assertions of "Nibbāna here and now" were comprised by the terms "percipient of unity" and "percipient of diversity" in ¶2. This explanation, however, is not convincing. Ñm, in Ms, had added the heading "Nibbāna Here and Now" over ¶10, and the following paragraphs do seem to correspond with the last four of the five doctrines of Nibbāna here and now in the Brahmajāla Sutta. However, this interpretation seems contradicted by ¶6 and by the phrase used in ¶p10–13, "with the relinquishing of views about the past and the future," which would exclude the doctrines of Nibbāna here and now from views about the future (though it is placed among such views in the preamble). The problem seems insoluble, and raises the suspicion that the text was to some degree corrupted in the course of its oral transmission. The insertion of the views about the past just below is also problematic. Not only are such views not mentioned in the preamble, but the placing of the past after the future inverts the normal time sequence. Skilling suggests this passage may have been part of an oral commentary on the sutta which, at some point, was absorbed into the text.</span></span></span></p>
