<section class="raw_sutta">  <!-- English and Pali -->
<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." — "Venerable, sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Bhikkhus, Sāriputta is wise; Sāriputta has great wisdom; Sāriputta has wide wisdom; Sāriputta has joyous wisdom; Sāriputta has quick wisdom; Sāriputta has keen wisdom; Sāriputta has penetrative wisdom. During half a month, bhikkhus, Sāriputta gained insight into states one by one as they occurred.<span class="note" id="n1046"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1046] <i>Anupadadhammavipassanā.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that he developed insight into states in successive order by way of the meditative attainments and the jhāna factors, as will be described. The two-week period referred to fell from the time of Ven. Sāriputta's ordination under the Buddha to his attainment of arahantship while listening to the Buddha explain the comprehension of feeling to Dīghanakha (see <a href="mn74.html#p8">MN74.14</a>).</span></span></span> Now Sāriputta's insight into states one by one as they occurred was this:</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Here, bhikkhus, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, Sāriputta entered upon and abided in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion.</p>

<p>"And the states in the first jhāna — the applied thought, the sustained thought, the rapture, the pleasure, and the unification of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention — these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred;<span class="note" id="n1047"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1047] The first five states in the list are the jhāna factors proper of the first jhāna; the following states are additional components each performing their individual functions within the jhāna. This minute analysis of mental states into their components anticipates the methodology of the Abhidhamma, and it is thus no coincidence that the name of Sāriputta is so closely linked with the emergence of the Abhidhamma literature.</span></span></span> known to him those states arose, known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus: ‘So indeed, these states, not having been, come into being; having been, they vanish.’ Regarding those states, he abided unattracted, unrepelled, independent, detached, free, dissociated, with a mind rid of barriers.<span class="note" id="n1048"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1048] All these terms signify the temporary suppression of the defilements by the power of the jhāna, not the full liberation from defilements through their eradication by the highest path, which Ven. Sāriputta had yet to attain.</span></span></span> He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond,’ and with the cultivation of that (attainment), he confirmed that there is.<span class="note" id="n1049"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1049] The "escape beyond" <i>(uttari̇ nissaraṇaṁ)</i> here is the next higher attainment, the second jhāna.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Again, bhikkhus, with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, Sāriputta entered and abided in the second jhāna, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration.</p>

<p>"And the states in the second jhāna — the self-confidence, the rapture, the pleasure, and the unification of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention — these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose, known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus: … and with the cultivation of that <span class="add">attainment</span>, he confirmed that there is.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Again, bhikkhus, with the fading away as well of rapture, Sāriputta abided in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he entered upon and abided in the third jhāna, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’</p>

<p>"And the states in the third jhāna — the equanimity, the pleasure, the mindfulness, the full awareness, and the unification of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention — these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose, known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus: … and with the cultivation of that <span class="add">attainment</span>, he confirmed that there is.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Again, bhikkhus, with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, Sāriputta entered upon and abided in the fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.</p>

<p>"And the states in the fourth jhāna — the equanimity, the neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling, the mental unconcern due to tranquillity,<span class="note" id="n1050"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1050] Reading with the BBS ed. <i>passaddhattā cetaso anābhogo.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that the mental concern with pleasure, which persists in the third jhāna, is now considered to be gross, and when it subsides there is "mental unconcern due to tranquillity." The PTS ed. reading, <i>passi vedanā,</i> is unintelligible and clearly an error.</span></span></span> the purity of mindfulness, and the unification of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention — these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose, known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus: … and with the cultivation of that <span class="add">attainment</span>, he confirmed that there is.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Again, bhikkhus, with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite,’ Sāriputta entered upon and abided in the base of infinite space.</p>

<p>"And the states in the base of infinite space — the perception of the base of infinite space and the unification of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention — these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose, known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus: … and with the cultivation of that <span class="add">attainment</span>, he confirmed that there is.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"Again, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite,’ Sāriputta entered upon and abided in the base of infinite consciousness.</p>

<p>"And the states in the base of infinite consciousness — the perception of the base of infinite consciousness and the unification of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention — these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose, known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus: … and with the cultivation of that <span class="add">attainment</span>, he confirmed that there is.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Again, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ Sāriputta entered upon and abided in the base of nothingness.</p>

<p>"And the states in the base of nothingness — the perception of the base of nothingness and the unification of mind; the contact, feeling, perception, volition, and mind; the zeal, decision, energy, mindfulness, equanimity, and attention — these states were defined by him one by one as they occurred; known to him those states arose, known they were present, known they disappeared. He understood thus: … and with the cultivation of that <span class="add">attainment</span>, he confirmed that there is.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Again, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, Sāriputta entered upon and abided in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception.</p>

<p>"He emerged mindful from that attainment. Having done so, he contemplated the states that had passed, ceased, and changed, thus: ‘So indeed, these states, not having been, come into being; having been, they vanish.’<span class="note" id="n1051"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1051] This indirect introspective method must be used to contemplate the fourth immaterial attainment because this attainment, being extremely subtle, does not enter into the direct range of investigation for disciples. Only fully enlightened Buddhas are able to contemplate it directly.</span></span></span> Regarding those states, he abided unattracted, unrepelled, independent, detached, free, dissociated, with a mind rid of barriers. He understood: ‘There is an escape beyond,’ and with the cultivation of that <span class="add">attainment</span>, he confirmed that there is.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Again, bhikkhus, by completely surmounting the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, Sāriputta entered upon and abided in the cessation of perception and feeling. And his taints were destroyed by his seeing with wisdom.<span class="note" id="n1052"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1052] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> offers this explanation of the passage, transmitted by "the elders of India": "The Elder Sāriputta cultivated serenity and insight in paired conjunction and realised the fruit of non-returning. Then he entered the attainment of cessation, and after emerging from it he attained arahantship."</span></span></span></p>

<p>"He emerged mindful from that attainment. Having done so, he recalled the states that had passed, ceased, and changed, thus: ‘So indeed, these states, not having been, come into being; having been, they vanish.’<span class="note" id="n1053"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1053] Since there are no mental factors in the attainment of cessation, <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> says that "these states" here must refer either to the states of material form that were occurring while he attained cessation, or to the mental factors of the preceding fourth immaterial attainment.</span></span></span> Regarding those states, he abided unattracted, unrepelled, independent, detached, free, dissociated, with a mind rid of barriers. He understood: ‘There is no escape beyond,’ and with the cultivation of that <span class="add">attainment</span>, he confirmed that there is not.<span class="note" id="n1054"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1054] Note the realisation that there is "<i>no</i> escape beyond" the attainment of arahantship.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Bhikkhus, rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone: ‘He has attained mastery and perfection<span class="note" id="n1055"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1055] <i>Abhiññāvosānapāramippatta.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains as the attainment of arahantship. This may be the only sense that the word pāramī bears in the four Nikāyas. In the later Theravāda literature, beginning perhaps with such works as the Buddhavaṁsa, this word comes to signify the perfect virtues that a bodhisatta must fulfil over many lives in order to attain Buddhahood. In that context it corresponds to the pāramitā of the Mahāyāna literature, though the numerical lists of virtues overlap only in part.</span></span></span> in noble virtue, attained mastery and perfection in noble concentration, attained mastery and perfection in noble wisdom, attained mastery and perfection in noble deliverance,’ it is of Sāriputta indeed that rightly speaking this should be said.</p>

<hr>
<p>"Bhikkhus, rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone: ‘He is the son of the Blessed One, born of his breast, born of his mouth, born of the Dhamma, created by the Dhamma, an heir in the Dhamma, not an heir in material things,’ it is of Sāriputta indeed that rightly speaking this should be said.</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, the matchless Wheel of the Dhamma set rolling by the Tathāgata is kept rolling rightly by Sāriputta."</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
