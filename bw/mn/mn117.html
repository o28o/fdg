<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." — "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you noble right concentration with its supports and its requisites.<span class="note" id="n1099"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1099] <i>Ariyaṁ sammā samādhiṁ sa-upanisaṁ saparikkhāraṁ.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains "noble" here as supramundane, and says that this is the concentration pertaining to the supramundane path. Its "supports and requisites," as will be shown, are the other seven path factors.</span></span></span> Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." — "Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"What, bhikkhus, is noble right concentration with its supports and its requisites, that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, and right mindfulness? Unification of mind equipped with these seven factors is called noble right concentration with its supports and its requisites.</p>

<h3><span class="add">View</span></h3>

<p>"Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first.<span class="note" id="n1100"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1100] <i>Pubbangamā,</i> lit. "the forerunner." <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> says that two kinds of right view are forerunners: the right view of insight, which investigates formations as impermanent, suffering, and non-self; and the right view of the path, which arises as a consequence of insight and effects the radical destruction of defilements. The right view of insight as the forerunner seems to be shown in the paragraphs below that follow [view], [Intention], etc.; the right view of the path as forerunner in the pararaphs following [The Great Forty].</span></span></span> And how does right view come first? One understands wrong view as wrong view and right view as right view: this is one's right view.<span class="note" id="n1101"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1101] This statement suggests that in order to acquire right view about the nature of reality, one must first be able to distinguish between wrong and right teachings on the nature of reality. MA says that this is the right view of insight which understands wrong view as an object by penetrating its characteristics of impermanence, etc., and which understands right view by exercising the function of comprehension and by clearing away confusion.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is wrong view? ‘There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed; no fruit or result of good and bad actions; no this world, no other world; no mother, no father; no beings who are reborn spontaneously; no good and virtuous recluses and brahmins in the world who have realised for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.’ This is wrong view.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is right view? Right view, I say, is twofold: there is right view that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions;<span class="note" id="n1102"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1102] This is mundane right view, a meritorious factor that conduces to a favourable rebirth but does not by itself transcend conditioned existence. The expression <i>upadhivepakka</i> is glossed by <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> to mean that it gives results consisting in the acquisitions (MṬ: = the continuity of the five aggregates).</span></span></span> and there is right view that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is right view that is affected by the taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions? ‘There is what is given and what is offered and what is sacrificed; there is fruit and result of good and bad actions; there is this world and the other world; there is mother and father; there are beings who are reborn spontaneously; there are in the world good and virtuous recluses and brahmins who have realised for themselves by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.’ This is right view affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is right view that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path? The wisdom, the faculty of wisdom, the power of wisdom, the investigation-of-states enlightenment factor, the path factor of right view in one whose mind is noble, whose mind is taintless, who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path:<span class="note" id="n1103"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1103] This definition defines supramundane right view as the wisdom <i>(paññā)</i> found among the aids to enlightenment as a faculty, power, enlightenment factor, and path factor. The definition is formulated by way of the cognitive function rather than the objective content of right view. Elsewhere (<a href="mn141.html#p20">MN&nbsp;141.24</a>) the right view of the path is defined as knowledge of the Four Noble Truths. We may understand that the conceptual comprehension of the four truths falls under mundane right view, while the direct penetration of the truths by realising Nibbāna with the path constitutes supramundane right view.</span></span></span> this is right view that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"One makes an effort to abandon wrong view and to enter upon right view: this is one's right effort. Mindfully one abandons wrong view, mindfully one enters upon and abides in right view: this is one's right mindfulness. Thus these three states run and circle around right view, that is, right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.<span class="note" id="n1104"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1104] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: They accompany right view as its co-existents and precursors. Right effort and right mindfulness are co-existent with supramundane right view; the right view of insight is the precursor of supramundane right view.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Intention</span></h3>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first. And how does right view come first? One understands wrong intention as wrong intention and right intention as right intention: this is one's right view.<span class="note" id="n1105"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1105] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains this as the right view of insight which understands right intention by way of its function and by clearing away confusion. It seems, though, that a more elementary discrimination of the two kinds of intention is the issue.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is wrong intention? The intention of sensual desire, the intention of ill will, and the intention of cruelty: this is wrong intention.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is right intention? Right intention, I say, is twofold: there is right intention that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions, and there is right intention that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is right intention that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions? The intention of renunciation, the intention of non-ill will, and the intention of non-cruelty:<span class="note" id="n1106"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1106] This is the standard definition of right intention as a factor of the Noble Eightfold Path; see <a href="../mn/mn141.html#p20">MN141</a>.</span></span></span> this is right intention that is affected by taints … ripening in the acquisitions.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is right intention that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path? The thinking, thought, intention, mental absorption, mental fixity, directing of mind, verbal formation in one whose mind is noble, whose mind is taintless, who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path:<span class="note" id="n1107"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1107] In this definition, the factor of intention <i>(saṅkappa)</i> is identified with applied thought <i>(vitakka)</i>, which is further specified as the factor responsible for absorption by fixing and directing the mind upon its object. For applied thought as "verbal formation," see <a href="../mn/mn44.html#p22">MN44</a>.</span></span></span> this is right intention that is noble … a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"One makes an effort to abandon wrong intention and to enter upon right intention: this is one's right effort. Mindfully one abandons wrong intention, mindfully one enters upon and abides in right intention: this is one's right mindfulness. Thus these three states run and circle around right intention, that is, right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.<span class="note" id="n1108"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1108] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: This statement refers exclusively to the co-existent factors accompanying supramundane right intention. In the preliminary phase of the practice, the three mundane right intentions arise separately, but at the moment of the supramundane path, a single right intention arises cutting off the threefold wrong intention. Thus the supramundane right intention may also be described as the intention of renunciation, non-ill will, and non-cruelty. The same method applies to right speech, etc.</span></span></span></p>

<h3 id="speech"><span class="add">Speech</span></h3>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first. And how does right view come first? One understands wrong speech as wrong speech and right speech as right speech: this is one's right view.</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is wrong speech? False speech, malicious speech, harsh speech, and gossip: this is wrong speech.</p>

<hr>
<p>“And what, bhikkhus, is right speech? Right speech, I say, is twofold: there is right speech that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions; and there is right speech that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is right speech that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions? Abstinence from false speech, abstinence from malicious speech, abstinence from harsh speech, abstinence from gossip: this is right speech that is affected by taints … ripening in the acquisitions.</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is right speech that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path? The desisting from the four kinds of verbal misconduct, the abstaining, refraining, abstinence from them in one whose mind is noble, whose mind is taintless, who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path:<span class="note" id="n1109"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1109] Whereas mundane right speech is exercised in four different modes according to the type of wrong speech from which there is abstinence, on the occasion of the supramundane path, the single factor of right speech exercises the fourfold function of cutting off the tendencies towards the four kinds of wrong speech. The same principle applies to right action.</span></span></span> this is right speech that is noble … a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"One makes an effort to abandon wrong speech and to enter upon right speech: this is one's right effort. Mindfully one abandons wrong speech, mindfully one enters upon and abides in right speech: this is one's right mindfulness. Thus these three states run and circle around right speech, that is, right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.</p>

<h3><span class="add">Action</span></h3>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first. And how does right view come first? One understands wrong action as wrong action and right action as right action: this is one's right view.</p>

<hr>
<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is wrong action? Killing living beings, taking what is not given, and misconduct in sensual pleasures: this is wrong action.</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is right action? Right action, I say, is twofold: there is right action that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions; and there is right action that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is right action that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions?</p>

<p>Abstinence from killing living beings, abstinence from taking what is not given, abstinence from misconduct in sensual pleasures: this is right action that is affected by taints … ripening in the acquisitions.</p>

<p>“And what, bhikkhus, is right action that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path? The desisting from the three kinds of bodily misconduct, the abstaining, refraining, abstinence from them in one whose mind is noble, whose mind is taintless, who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path: this is right action that is noble … a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"One makes an effort to abandon wrong action and to enter upon right action: this is one's right effort. Mindfully one abandons wrong action, mindfully one enters upon and dwells in right action: this is one's right mindfulness. Thus these three states run and circle around right action, that is, right view, right effort, and right mindfulness.</p>

<h3 id="live"><span class="add">Livelihood</span></h3>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first. And how does right view come first? One understands wrong livelihood as wrong livelihood and right livelihood as right livelihood: this is one's right view.</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is wrong livelihood? Scheming, talking, hinting, belittling, pursuing gain with gain: this is wrong livelihood.<span class="note" id="n1110"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1110] These are wrong means for bhikkhus to acquire their requisites; they are explained at Vsm I, 61–65. MA says that those mentioned in the sutta are not the only kinds of wrong livelihood, which include any mode of earning one's living that involves transgression of the precepts. At <a href="../an/an5.177.html">AN&nbsp;5:177</a>/iii.208, the Buddha mentions five kinds of wrong livelihood for lay people: dealing in arms, beings, meat, intoxicants, and poisons.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is right livelihood? Right livelihood, I say, is twofold: there is right livelihood that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions; and there is right livelihood that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is right livelihood that is affected by taints, partaking of merit, ripening in the acquisitions? Here, bhikkhus, a noble disciple abandons wrong livelihood and gains his living by right livelihood: this is right livelihood that is affected by taints … ripening in the acquisitions.</p>

<p>"And what, bhikkhus, is right livelihood that is noble, taintless, supramundane, a factor of the path? The desisting from wrong livelihood, the abstaining, refraining, abstinence from it in one whose mind is noble, whose mind is taintless, who possesses the noble path and is developing the noble path: this is right livelihood that is noble … a factor of the path.</p>

<p>"One makes an effort to abandon wrong livelihood and to enter upon right livelihood: this is one's right effort.

<h3><span class="add">The Great Forty</span></h3>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"Therein, bhikkhus, right view comes first. And how does right view come first? In one of right view, right intention comes into being;<span class="note" id="n1111"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1111] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that for one having the right view of the path, the right intention of the path comes into being; similarly, for one having the right view of the fruit, the right intention of the fruit comes into being. Similarly, the following factors except the last two also refer to the supramundane path.</span></span></span> in one of right intention, right speech comes into being; in one of right speech, right action comes into being; in one of right action, right livelihood comes into being; in one of right livelihood, right effort comes into being; in one of right effort, right mindfulness comes into being; in one of right mindfulness, right concentration comes into being; in one of right concentration, right knowledge comes into being; in one of right knowledge, right deliverance comes into being.
