<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Vesālī in the grove outside the city to the west. Now on that occasion Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, had recently left this Dhamma and Discipline.<span class="note" id="n177"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.177] The Sunakkhatta Sutta (<a href="../mn/mn105.html">MN105</a>) had been expounded to him by the Buddha, apparently before he joined the Saṅgha; the account of his defection is given in the Pāṭika Sutta <a class="seesuttta" href="../dn/dn24.html">DN24.</a> He became dissatisfied and left the Order because the Buddha would not perform any miracles for him or explain to him the beginning of things.</span></span></span> He was making this statement before the Vesālī assembly: "The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.<span class="note" id="n178"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.178] Superhuman states <i>(<i>uttari manussadhammā</i>)</i> are states, virtues, or attainments higher than the ordinary human virtues comprised in the ten wholesome courses of action <a href="../mn/mn9.html#5">(see MN9.5)</a>; they include the jhānas, the kinds of direct knowledge, and the paths and fruits. "Distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones" <i>(<i>alamariyañāṇadassanavisesa </i>)</i>, a frequently occurring expression in the suttas, signifies all higher degrees of meditative knowledge characteristic of the noble individual. Here, according to <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA,</a> it means specifically the supramundane path, which Sunakkhatta is denying of the Buddha.</span></span></span> The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma <span class="add">merely</span> hammered out by reasoning, following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him, and when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of suffering."<span class="note" id="n179"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.179] The gist of his criticism is that the Buddha teaches a doctrine that he has merely worked out in thought rather than one he has realised through transcendental wisdom. Apparently he believes that being led to the complete destruction of suffering is, as a goal, inferior to the acquisition of miraculous powers.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2–3</span>Then, when it was morning, the venerable Sāriputta dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Vesālī for alms. Then he heard Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, making this statement before the Vesālī assembly. When he had wandered for alms in Vesālī and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One what Sunakkhatta was saying.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span><span class="add">The Blessed One said:</span> "Sāriputta, the misguided man Sunakkhatta is angry and his words are spoken out of anger. Thinking to discredit the Tathāgata, he actually praises him; for it is praise of the Tathāgata to say of him: ‘When he teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it leads him when he practises it to the complete destruction of suffering.’</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Sāriputta, this misguided man Sunakkhatta will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘That Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’<span class="note" id="n180"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.180] All the sections to follow are intended as a rebuttal of Sunakkhatta's criticism of the Buddha. ¶¶6–8 cover the first three of the six direct knowledges <i>(abhiññā)</i>, the last three appearing as the last of the ten powers of the Tathāgata. The latter, according to <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA,</a> are to be understood as powers of knowledge <i>(ñaṇabala)</i> that are attained by all Buddhas as the fruit of their accumulation of merit. The Vibhaṅga (§§809–31/440–51) of the Abhidhamma Piṭaka provides an elaborate analysis of them.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘That Blessed One enjoys the various kinds of supernormal power: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one; he appears and vanishes; he goes unhindered through a wall, through an enclosure, through a mountain, as though through space; he dives in and out of the earth as though it were water; he walks on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, he travels in space like a bird; with his hand he touches and strokes the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; he wields bodily mastery even as far as the Brahma-world.’</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘With the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, that Blessed One hears both kinds of sounds, the heavenly and the human, those that are far as well as near.’</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"And he will never infer of me according to Dhamma: ‘That Blessed One encompasses with his own mind the minds of other beings, other persons. He understands a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; he understands a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate; he understands a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; he understands a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; he understands an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; he understands a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; he understands a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; he understands a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated.’</p>

<h3><span class="add">Ten Powers of a Tathāgata</span></h3>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Sāriputta, the Tathāgata has these ten Tathāgata's powers, possessing which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahmā.<span class="note" id="n181"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.181] On the Buddha’s sounding of his lion's roar, see <a href="../sn/sn22.78.html">SN&nbsp;22:78</a>/iii.84–86. The Wheel of Brahmā is the supreme, best, most excellent wheel, the Wheel of the Dhamma <i>(dhammacakka)</i> in its twofold meaning: the knowledge penetrating the truth and the knowledge of how to expound the teaching (MA).</span></span></span> What are the ten?</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>(1) "Here, the Tathāgata understands as it actually is the possible as possible and the impossible as impossible.<span class="note" id="n182"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.182] Vbh §809 explicates this knowledge by quoting at length <a href="../mn/mn115.html#12">MN115.12–17</a>. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA,</a> however, explains it differently as the knowledge of the correlations between causes and their results.</span></span></span> And that is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, by virtue of which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahmā.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>(2) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it actually is the results of actions undertaken, past, future, and present, by way of possibilities and causes. That too is a Tathāgata's power … <span class="note" id="n183"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.183] This knowledge can be exemplified by the Buddha’s analysis of kamma in <a href="../mn/mn57.html">MN57</a>, <a href="../mn/mn135.html">MN135</a>, and <a href="../mn/mn136.html">MN136</a>. MA explains the possibility <i>(ṭhāna)</i> as the realm, circumstances, time, and effort — factors that can either impede or reinforce the result; the cause <i>(hetu)</i> is the kamma itself.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>(3) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it actually is the ways leading to all destinations. That too is a Tathāgata's power … <span class="note" id="n184"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.184] This knowledge will be elucidated in ¶¶34–41 below.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>(4) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it actually is the world with its many and different elements. That too is a Tathāgata's power … <span class="note" id="n185"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.185] The Tathāgata's understanding of the many elements constituting the world will be found in <a href="../mn/mn115.html#4">MN&nbsp;115.4–9</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>(5) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it actually is how beings have different inclinations. That too is a Tathāgata's power … <span class="note" id="n186"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.186] Vbh §813 explains that the Tathāgata understands that beings are of inferior inclinations and superior inclinations, and that they gravitate towards those who share their own inclinations.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>(6) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it actually is the disposition of the faculties of other beings, other persons. That too is a Tathāgata's power … <span class="note" id="n187"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.187] Vbh §§814–27 gives a detailed analysis. MA states the meaning more concisely as the Tathāgata's knowledge of the superiority and inferiority of beings’ faculties of faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, and wisdom.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>(7) "Again, the Tathāgata understands as it actually is the defilement, the cleansing, and the emergence in regard to the jhānas, liberations, concentrations, and attainments. That too is a Tathāgata's power … <span class="note" id="n188"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.188] Vbh §828: The "defilement" <i>(saṅkilesa)</i> is a state causing deterioration, "cleansing" <i>(vodāna)</i> a state causing excellence, "emergence" <i>(vuṭṭāna)</i> is both cleansing and the rising out of an attainment. The eight liberations <i>(vimokkhā)</i> are enumerated in <a href="../mn/mn72.html#22">MN77.22 </a>and <a href="../mn/mn137.html#26">MN137.26</a>; the nine attainments <i>(samāpatti)</i> are the four jhānas, four immaterial attainments, and the cessation of perception and feeling as in <a href="../mn/mn25.html#12">MN25.12–20</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>(8) "Again, the Tathāgata recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion: ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared here.’ Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. That too is a Tathāgata's power …</p>

<hr>
<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>(9) "Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Tathāgata sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate. I understood how beings pass on according to their actions thus: ‘These worthy beings who were ill conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in hell; but these worthy beings who were well conducted in body, speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions. That too is a Tathāgata's power …</p>

<hr>
<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>(10) "Again, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, the Tathāgata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints. That too is a Tathāgata's power that the Tathāgata has, by virtue of which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahmā.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"The Tathāgata has these ten Tathāgata's powers, possessing which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahmā.</p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"Sāriputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: ‘The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma <span class="add">merely</span> hammered out by reasoning, following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him’ — unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view, then as <span class="add">surely as if he had been</span> carried off and put there he will wind up in hell.<span class="note" id="n189"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.189] The idiom <i>yathābhataṁ nikkhitto evaṁ niraye</i> is knotty; the rendering here follows the commentary: "He will be put in hell as if carried off and put there by the wardens of hell."</span></span></span> Just as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue, concentration, and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge, so it will happen in this case, I say, that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view, then as <span class="add">surely as if he had been</span> carried off and put there he will wind up in hell.</p>

<h3><span class="add">Four Kinds of Intrepidity</span></h3>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>"Sāriputta, the Tathāgata has these four kinds of intrepidity, possessing which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahmā. What are the four?</p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>"Here, I see no ground on which any recluse or brahmin or god or Māra or Brahmā or anyone else at all in the world could, in accordance with the Dhamma, accuse me thus: ‘While you claim to be fully enlightened, you are not fully enlightened about these things.’ And seeing no ground for that, I abide in safety, fearlessness, and intrepidity.</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>"I see no ground on which any recluse … or anyone at all could accuse me thus: ‘While you claim to be one who has destroyed the taints, you have not destroyed these taints.’ And seeing no ground for that, I abide in safety, fearlessness, and intrepidity.</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>"I see no ground on which any recluse … or anyone at all could accuse me thus: ‘Those things called obstructions by you are not able to obstruct one who engages in them.’ And seeing no ground for that, I abide in safety, fearlessness, and intrepidity.</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>"I see no ground on which any recluse … or anyone at all could accuse me thus: ‘When you teach the Dhamma to someone, it does not lead him when he practises it to the complete destruction of suffering.’ And seeing no ground for that, I abide in safety, fearlessness, and intrepidity.</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>"A Tathāgata has these four kinds of intrepidity, possessing which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahmā.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>"Sāriputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me … he will wind up in hell.</p>

<h3><span class="add">The Eight Assemblies</span></h3>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>"Sāriputta, there are these eight assemblies. What are the eight? An assembly of nobles, an assembly of brahmins, an assembly of householders, an assembly of recluses, an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings, an assembly of gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three, an assembly of Māra's retinue, an assembly of Brahmās. Possessing these four kinds of intrepidity, the Tathāgata approaches and enters these eight assemblies.</p>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>"I recall having approached many hundred assemblies of nobles … many hundred assemblies of brahmins … many hundred assemblies of householders … many hundred assemblies of recluses … many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Four Great Kings … many hundred assemblies of gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three … many hundred assemblies of Māra's retinue … many hundred assemblies of Brahmās. And formerly I had sat with them there and talked with them and held conversations with them, yet I see no ground for thinking that fear or timidity might come upon me there. And seeing no ground for that, I abide in safety, fearlessness, and intrepidity.</p>

<p>"What is egg-born generation? There are these beings born by breaking out of the shell of an egg; this is called egg-born generation. What is womb-born generation? There are these beings born by breaking out from the caul; this is called womb-born generation. What is moisture-born generation? There are these beings born in a rotten fish, in a rotten corpse, in rotten porridge, in a cesspit, or in a sewer; this is called moisture-born generation. What is spontaneous generation? There are gods and denizens of hell and certain human beings and some beings in the lower worlds; this is called spontaneous generation. These are the four kinds of generation.</p>

<h3><span class="add">The Bodhisatta's Austerities</span></h3>

<p id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>"Sāriputta, I recall having lived a holy life possessing four factors. I have been an ascetic — a supreme ascetic; I have been coarse — supremely coarse; I have been scrupulous — supremely scrupulous; I have been secluded — supremely secluded.<span class="note" id="n192"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.192] At this juncture, <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> informs us, the Buddha related this account of his past ascetic practices because Sunakkhatta was a great admirer of extreme asceticism (as the Pāṭika Sutta shows) and the Buddha wanted to make it known that there was no one who could equal him in the practice of austerities. The passages to follow should be collated with <a href="mn4.html#p16">MN&nbsp;4.20</a> and <a href="mn36.html#p20">MN&nbsp;36.20–30</a> for a fuller picture of the Bodhisatta's experiment with the extreme of self-mortification.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Such was my asceticism, Sāriputta, that I went naked, rejecting conventions, licking my hands, not coming when asked, not stopping when asked; I did not accept food brought or food specially made or an invitation to a meal; I received nothing from a pot, from a bowl, across a threshold, across a stick, across a pestle, from two eating together, from a pregnant woman, from a woman giving suck, from a woman in the midst of men, from where food was advertised to be distributed, from where a dog was waiting, from where flies were buzzing; I accepted no fish or meat, I drank no liquor, wine, or fermented brew. I kept to one house, to one morsel; I kept to two houses, to two morsels; … I kept to seven houses, to seven morsels. I lived on one saucerful a day, on two saucerfuls a day … on seven saucerfuls a day; I took food once a day, once every two days … once every seven days; thus even up to once every fortnight, I dwelt pursuing the practice of taking food at stated intervals.</p>

<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>I was an eater of greens or millet or wild rice or hide-parings or moss or ricebran or rice-scum or sesamum flour or grass or cowdung. I lived on forest roots and fruits; I fed on fallen fruits.</p>

<p id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>I clothed myself in hemp, in hemp-mixed cloth, in shrouds, in refuse rags, in tree bark, in antelope hide, in strips of antelope hide, in kusagrass fabric, in bark fabric, in wood-shavings fabric, in head-hair wool, in animal wool, in owls’ wings. I was one who pulled out hair and beard, pursuing the practice of pulling out hair and beard. I was one who stood continuously, rejecting seats. I was one who squatted continuously, devoted to maintaining the squatting position. I was one who used a mattress of spikes; I made a mattress of spikes my bed. I dwelt pursuing the practice of bathing in water three times daily including the evening. Thus in such a variety of ways I dwelt pursuing the practice of tormenting and mortifying the body. Such was my asceticism.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p45"><span class="parno">45</span>"Such was my coarseness, Sāriputta, that just as the bole of a tindukā tree, accumulating over the years, cakes and flakes off, so too, dust and dirt, accumulating over the years, caked off my body and flaked off. It never occurred to me: ‘Oh, let me rub this dust and dirt off with my hand, or let another rub this dust and dirt off with his hand’ — it never occurred to me thus. Such was my coarseness.</p>

<p id="p46"><span class="parno">46</span>"Such was my scrupulousness, Sāriputta, that I was always mindful in stepping forwards and stepping backwards. I was full of pity even in regard to a drop of water thus: ‘Let me not hurt the tiny creatures in the crevices of the ground.’<span class="note" id="n193"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.193] The idea seems to be that his pity was directed, not towards the microbes in a drop of water (as the rendering in the first edition implied), but towards the creatures that might be hurt or killed by carelessly discarded water.</span></span></span> Such was my scrupulousness.</p>

<p id="p47"><span class="parno">47</span>"Such was my seclusion, Sāriputta, that I would plunge into some forest and dwell there. And when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd or someone gathering grass or sticks, or a woodsman, I would flee from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hollow to hollow, from hillock to hillock. Why was that? So that they should not see me or I see them. Just as a forest-bred deer, on seeing human beings, flees from grove to grove, from thicket to thicket, from hollow to hollow, from hillock to hillock, so too, when I saw a cowherd or a shepherd … Such was my seclusion.</p>

<p id="p48"><span class="parno">48</span>"I would go on all fours to the cow-pens when the cattle had gone out and the cowherd had left them, and I would feed on the dung of the young suckling calves. As long as my own excrement and urine lasted, I fed on my own excrement and urine. Such was my great practice of feeding on filth.</p>

<p id="p49"><span class="parno">49</span>"I would plunge into some awe-inspiring grove and dwell there — a grove so awe-inspiring that it would make most of a man's hairs stand up if he were not freed from lust. When those cold wintry nights came during the ‘eight-days period of snowfall, ’ I would dwell by night in the open and by day in the grove.<span class="note" id="n194"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.194] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> says that the "eight-days period of snowfall" <i>(antaraṭṭhaka himapātasamaya)</i> occurs over the last four days of the month Magha and the first four days of the month Phagguna (i.e., in late February). However, the cold period in South Asia typically falls in late December or early January.</span></span></span> In the last month of the hot season I would dwell by day in the open and by night in the grove. And there came to me spontaneously this stanza never heard before:</p>

<hr>
<p class="verse" id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>‘Chilled by night and scorched by day,
<br>Alone in awe-inspiring groves,
<br>Naked, no fire to sit beside,
<br>The sage yet pursues his quest.’</p>

<p id="p51"><span class="parno">51</span>"I would make my bed in a charnel ground with the bones of the dead for a pillow. And cowherd boys came up and spat on me, urinated on me, threw dirt at me, and poked sticks into my ears. Yet I do not recall that I ever aroused an evil mind <span class="add">of hate</span> against them. Such was my abiding in equanimity.</p>

<p id="p52"><span class="parno">52</span>"Sāriputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘Purification comes about through food.’<span class="note" id="n195"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.195] That is, they hold the view that beings are purified by special diets and reduced intake of food.</span></span></span> They say: ‘Let us live on kola-fruits,’ and they eat kola-fruits, they eat kola-fruit powder, they drink kola-fruit water, and they make many kinds of kola-fruit concoctions. Now I recall having eaten a single kola-fruit a day. Sāriputta, you may think that the kola-fruit was bigger at that time, yet you should not regard it so: the kola-fruit was then at most the same size as now. Through feeding on a single kola-fruit a day, my body reached a state of extreme emaciation. Because of eating so little my limbs became like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems. Because of eating so little my backside became like a camel's hoof. Because of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads. Because of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roof-less barn. Because of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets, looking like a gleam of water that has sunk far down in a deep well. Because of eating so little my scalp shrivelled and withered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sun. Because of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone; thus if I wanted to touch my belly skin I encountered my backbone, and if I wanted to touch my backbone I encountered my belly skin. Because of eating so little, if I wanted to defecate or urinate, I fell over on my face right there. Because of eating so little, if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell from my body as I rubbed.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p53"><span class="parno">53</span>"Sāriputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘Purification comes about through food.’ They say: ‘Let us live on beans,’ … ‘Let us live on sesamum,’ … ‘Let us live on rice,’ and they eat rice, they eat rice powder, they drink rice water, and they make many kinds of rice concoctions. Now I recall having eaten a single rice grain a day. Sāriputta, you may think that the rice grain was bigger at that time, yet you should not regard it so: the rice grain was then at most the same size as now. Through feeding on a single rice grain a day, my body reached a state of extreme emaciation. Because of eating so little … the hair, rotted at its roots, fell from my body as I rubbed.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p54"><span class="parno">54</span>"Yet, Sāriputta, by such conduct, by such practice, by such performance of austerities, I did not attain any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. Why was that? Because I did not attain that noble wisdom which when attained is noble and emancipating and leads the one who practises in accordance with it to the complete destruction of suffering.</p>

<p id="p55"><span class="parno">55</span>"Sāriputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘Purification comes about through the round of rebirths.’ But it is not easy to find a realm in the round that I have not already passed through in this long journey, except for the gods of the Pure Abodes; and had I passed through the round as a god in the Pure Abodes, I would never have returned to this world.<span class="note" id="n196"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.196] Rebirth into the Pure Abodes <i>(suddhāvāsa)</i> is possible only for non-returners.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p56"><span class="parno">56</span>"There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘Purification comes about through <span class="add">some particular kind of</span> rebirth.’ But it is not easy to find a kind of rebirth that I have not been reborn in already in this long journey, except for the gods of the Pure Abodes …</p>

<p id="p57"><span class="parno">57</span>"There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘Purification comes about through <span class="add">some particular</span> abode.’ But it is not easy to find a kind of abode that I have not already dwelt in … except for the gods of the Pure Abodes …</p>

<p id="p58"><span class="parno">58</span>"There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘Purification comes about through sacrifice.’ But it is not easy to find a kind of sacrifice that has not already been offered up by me in this long journey, when I was either a head-anointed noble king or a well-to-do brahmin.</p>

<p id="p59"><span class="parno">59</span>"There are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘Purification comes through fire-worship.’ But it is not easy to find a kind of fire that has not already been worshipped by me in this long journey, when I was either a head-anointed noble king or a well-to-do brahmin.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p60"><span class="parno">60</span>"Sāriputta, there are certain recluses and brahmins whose doctrine and view is this: ‘As long as this good man is still young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessing of youth, in the prime of life, so long is he perfect in his lucid wisdom. But when this good man is old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the last stage, being eighty, ninety, or a hundred years old, then the lucidity of his wisdom is lost.’ But it should not be regarded so. I am now old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, and come to the last stage: my years have turned eighty. Now suppose that I had four disciples with a hundred years’ lifespan, perfect in mindfulness, retentiveness, memory, and lucidity of wisdom.<span class="note" id="n197"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.197] The Pali for the four terms is: <i>sati, gati, dhiti, paññāveyyattiya.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains <i>sati</i> as the ability to grasp in mind a hundred or a thousand phrases as they are being spoken; gati as the ability to bind them and retain them in the mind; <i>dhiti</i> as the ability to recite back what has been grasped and retained; and <i>paññāveyyattiya</i> as the ability to discern the meaning and logic of those phrases.</span></span></span> Just as a skilled archer, trained, practised, and tested, could easily shoot a light arrow across the shadow of a palm tree, suppose that they were even to that extent perfect in mindfulness, retentiveness, memory, and lucidity of wisdom. Suppose that they continuously asked me about the four foundations of mindfulness and that I answered them when asked and that they remembered each answer of mine and never asked a subsidiary question or paused except to eat, drink, consume food, taste, urinate, defecate, and rest in order to remove sleepiness and tiredness. Still the Tathāgata's exposition of the Dhamma, his explanations of factors of the Dhamma, and his replies to questions would not yet come to an end, but meanwhile those four disciples of mine with their hundred years’ lifespan would have died at the end of those hundred years. Sāriputta, even if you have to carry me about on a bed, still there will be no change in the lucidity of the Tathāgata's wisdom.</p>

<p>"Rightly speaking, were it to be said of anyone: ‘A being not subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the welfare and happiness of many, out of compassion for the world, for the good, welfare, and happiness of gods and humans,’ it is of me indeed that rightly speaking this should be said."</p>
