<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the venerable Bakkula was living at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.<span class="note" id="n1167"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1167] According to <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>, Ven. Bakkula became a monk in his eightieth year, which would make him 160 at the time this sutta takes place. He was declared by the Buddha to be the foremost disciple with respect to good health.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then Acela Kassapa, a former companion of the venerable Bakkula in his lay life, went to the venerable Bakkula and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and asked the venerable Bakkula:</p>

<p>"It is eighty years since I went forth, friend."</p>

<p>"Friend Bakkula, in these eighty years how many times have you engaged in sexual intercourse?"</p>

<p>"Friend Kassapa, you should not ask me such a question as that. You should ask me such a question as this: ‘Friend Bakkula, in these eighty years how many times have perceptions of sensual desire arisen in you?’"</p>

<p>"Friend Bakkula, in these eighty years how many times have perceptions of sensual desire arisen in you?"</p>

Bakkula himself did not give the ordination (which would have been a violation of his mode of practice) but arranged for other bhikkhus to give it.</span></span></span> And soon, not long after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Kassapa, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. He knew directly: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being." And the venerable Kassapa became one of the arahants.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Then, on a later occasion, the venerable Bakkula took a key and went from dwelling to dwelling, saying: "Come forth, venerable sirs; come forth, venerable sirs. Today I shall attain final Nibbāna."</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>Then, seated in the midst of the Saṅgha of bhikkhus, the venerable Bakkula attained final Nibbāna.<span class="note" id="n1172"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1172] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: Ven. Bakkula had considered that all his life he had never made himself a burden to the other bhikkhus, and he did not want his body to be a burden after his death. Thus he entered into meditation on the heat element and attained final Nibbāna by causing his entire body to be consumed by the blaze. Only the relics remained.</span></span></span></p>
