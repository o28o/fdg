<section class="raw_sutta">  <!-- English and Pali -->
<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Kosamb in Ghosita's Park.</p>

<p>Now on that occasion the bhikkhus at Kosambī had taken to quarrelling and brawling and were deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers.<span class="note" id="n1186"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1186] The opening of this sutta is the same as that of <a href="mn48.html">MN&nbsp;48</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then a certain bhikkhu went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he stood at one side and said: "Venerable sir, the bhikkhus here at Kosambī have taken to quarrelling and brawling and are deep in disputes, stabbing each other with verbal daggers. It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would go to those bhikkhus out of compassion." The Blessed One consented in silence.</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One went to those bhikkhus and said to them: "Enough, bhikkhus, let there be no quarrelling, brawling, wrangling, or dispute."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>When this was said, a certain bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Wait, venerable sir! Let the Blessed One, the Lord of the Dhamma, live at ease devoted to a pleasant abiding here and now. We are the ones who will be responsible for this quarrelling, brawling, wrangling, and dispute."</p>

<p>For a second time … For a third time the Blessed One said: "Enough, bhikkhus, let there be no quarrelling, brawling, wrangling, or dispute." For a third time that bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Wait, venerable sir! … We are the ones who will be responsible for this quarrelling, brawling, wrangling, and dispute."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, entered Kosambī for alms. When he had wandered for alms in Kosambī and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he set his resting place in order, took his bowl and outer robe, and while standing uttered these stanzas:</p>

<p id="p4" class="verse"><span class="parno">4</span>"When many voices shout at once
<br>None considers himself a fool;
<br>Though the Saṅgha is being split
<br>None thinks himself to be at fault.</p>

<p id="p5" class="verse"><span class="parno">5</span>They have forgotten thoughtful speech,
<br>They talk obsessed by words alone.
<br>Uncurbed their mouths, they bawl at will;
<br>None knows what leads him so to act.</p>

<p id="p6" class="verse"><span class="parno">6</span>‘He abused me, he struck me,<span class="note" id="n1187"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1187] Verses 6 to 8 are also found at <a href="../dhp/dhp1-20.html">Dhammapada 2 to 6.</a> (Verses 11 to 13 are also found <a href="../dhp/dhp320-333.html#328">Dhammapada 328 to 330</a>).</span></span></span>
<br>He defeated me, he robbed me’ — 
<br>In those who harbour thoughts like these
<br>Hatred will never be allayed.</p>

<p id="p7" class="verse"><span class="parno">7</span>‘He abused me, he struck me,
<br>He defeated me, he robbed me.’
<br>In those who do not harbour thoughts like these
<br>Hatred will readily be allayed.</p>

<p id="p8" class="verse"><span class="parno">8</span>For in this world hatred is never
<br>Allayed by further acts of hate.
<br>It is allayed by non-hatred:
<br>That is the fixed and ageless law.</p>

<p id="p9" class="verse"><span class="parno">9</span>Those others do not recognise
<br>That here we should restrain ourselves.
<br>But those wise ones who realise this
<br>At once end all their enmity.</p>

<p id="p10" class="verse"><span class="parno">10</span>Breakers of bones and murderers,
<br>Those who steal cattle, horses, wealth,

<br>A virtuous, steadfast companion,
<br>Then overcome all threats of danger
<br>And walk with him content and mindful.</p>

<p id="p12" class="verse"><span class="parno">12</span>But if one finds no worthy friend,
<br>No virtuous, steadfast companion,
<br>Then as a king leaves his conquered realm,
<br>Walk like a tusker in the woods alone.</p>

<p id="p13" class="verse"><span class="parno">13</span>Better it is to walk alone,
<br>There is no companionship with fools.
<br>Walk alone and do no evil,
<br>At ease like a tusker in the woods."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>Then, having uttered these stanzas while standing, the Blessed One went to the village of Bālakaloṇakāra. On that occasion the venerable Bhagu was living at the village of Bālakaloṇakāra. When the venerable Bhagu saw the Blessed One coming in the distance, he prepared a seat and set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready and washed his feet. The venerable Bhagu paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side, and the Blessed One said to him: "I hope you are keeping well, bhikkhu, I hope you are comfortable, I hope you are not having any trouble getting almsfood."</p>

<p>"I am keeping well, Blessed One, I am comfortable, and I am not having any trouble getting almsfood."</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One instructed, urged, roused, and gladdened the venerable Bhagu with talk on the Dhamma, after which he rose from his seat and went to the Eastern Bamboo Park.</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Now on that occasion the venerable Anuruddha, the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila were living at the Eastern Bamboo Park.<span class="note" id="n1188"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1188] The passage at ¶¶15–19 is nearly identical with <a href="mn31.html#p3.">MN&nbsp;31.3–10.</a> From the sequel, however, it is clear that the present sutta is set at an earlier time, for in MN&nbsp;31 all three bhikkhus have reached arahantship while here they are still striving for the goal.</span></span></span> The park keeper saw the Blessed One coming in the distance and told him: "Do not enter this park, recluse. There are three clansmen here seeking their own good. Do not disturb them."</p>

<p>The venerable Anuruddha heard the park keeper speaking to the Blessed One and told him: "Friend park keeper, do not keep the Blessed One out. It is our Teacher, the Blessed One, who has come."</p>

<p>Then the venerable Anuruddha went to the venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila and said: "Come out, venerable sirs, come out! Our Teacher, the Blessed One, has come."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>Then all three went to meet the Blessed One. One took his bowl and outer robe, one prepared a seat, and one set out water for washing the feet. The Blessed One sat down on the seat made ready and washed his feet. Then those three venerable ones paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side, and the Blessed One said to them: "I hope you are all keeping well, Anuruddha, I hope you are comfortable, I hope you are not having any trouble getting almsfood."</p>

<hr>
<p>"We are keeping well, Blessed One, we are comfortable, and we are not having any trouble getting almsfood."</p>

<hr>
<p>"I hope, Anuruddha, that you are all living in concord, with mutual appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with kindly eyes."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Surely, venerable sir, we are living in concord, with mutual appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with kindly eyes."</p>

<hr>
<p>"But, Anuruddha, how do you live thus?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Venerable sir, as to that, I think thus: ‘It is a gain for me, it is a great gain for me that I am living with such companions in the holy life.’ I maintain bodily acts of loving-kindness towards these venerable ones both openly and privately; I maintain verbal acts of loving-kindness towards them both openly and privately; I maintain mental acts of loving-kindness towards them both openly and privately. I consider: ‘Why should I not set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do?’ Then I set aside what I wish to do and do what these venerable ones wish to do. We are different in body, venerable sir, but one in mind."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>The venerable Nandiya and the venerable Kimbila each spoke likewise, adding: "That is how, venerable sir, we are living in concord, with mutual appreciation, without disputing, blending like milk and water, viewing each other with kindly eyes."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"Good, good, Anuruddha. I hope that you all abide diligent, ardent, and resolute."</p>

<p>"Surely, venerable sir, we abide diligent, ardent, and resolute."</p>

<p>"But, Anuruddha, how do you abide thus?"</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, as to that, whichever of us returns first from the village with almsfood prepares the seats, sets out the water for drinking and for washing, and puts the refuse bucket in its place. Whichever of us returns last eats any food left over, if he wishes; otherwise he throws it away where there is no greenery or drops it into water where there is no life. He puts away the seats and the water for drinking and for washing. He puts away the refuse bucket after washing it, and he sweeps out the refectory. Whoever notices that the pots of water for drinking, washing, or the latrine are low or empty takes care of them. If they are too heavy for him, he calls someone else by a signal of the hand and they move it by joining hands, but because of this we do not break out into speech. But every five days we sit together all night discussing the Dhamma. That is how we abide diligent, ardent, and resolute."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"Good, good, Anuruddha. But while you abide thus diligent, ardent, and resolute, have you attained any superhuman states, a distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, a comfortable abiding?"</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, as we abide here diligent, ardent, and resolute, we perceive both light and a vision of forms.<span class="note" id="n1189"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1189] It is here that the present sutta continues differently from <a href="mn31.html">MN&nbsp;31</a>. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains light <i>(obhāsa)</i> as the preliminary light, which MṬ glosses as the light produced by the access to jhāna. MṬ adds that one who gains the fourth jhāna develops the light-kasiṇa as the preliminary to arousing the divine eye. The "vision of forms" <i>(dassanȧ rūpānaṁ)</i> is the seeing of forms with the divine eye. Ven. Anuruddha was later declared by the Buddha to be the foremost disciple in the exercise of the divine eye.</span></span></span> Soon afterwards the light and the vision of forms disappear, but we have not discovered the cause for that."</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"You should discover the cause for that,<span class="note" id="n1190"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1190] <i>Nimittaṁ paṭivijjhitabbāṁ</i> Lit. "You should penetrate that sign."</span></span></span> Anuruddha. Before my enlightenment, while I was still only an unenlightened Bodhisatta, I too perceived both light and a vision of forms. Soon afterwards the light and the vision of forms disappeared. I thought: ‘What is the cause and condition why the light and the vision of forms have disappeared?’ Then I considered thus: ‘Doubt arose in me, and because of the doubt my concentration fell away; when my concentration fell away, the light and the vision of forms disappeared. I shall so act that doubt will not arise in me again.’</p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"As, Anuruddha, I was abiding diligent, ardent, and resolute, I perceived both light and a vision of forms. Soon afterward the light and the vision of forms disappeared. I thought: ‘What is the cause and condition why the light and the vision of forms have disappeared?’ Then I considered thus: ‘Inattention arose in me, and because of inattention my concentration fell away; when my concentration fell away, the light and the vision of forms disappeared.

Of these, the first is the first jhāna and the third covers the three higher jhānas of the usual fourfold scheme. The second type of concentration has no place in the fourfold scheme, but appears as the second jhāna in a fivefold division of jhānas expounded in the Abhidhamma Piṭaka.
