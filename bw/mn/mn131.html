<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n1209"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1209] This discourse with a lengthy introduction and notes is available separately in a translation by Bhikkhu Ñāṇananda under the title <a href="http://www.bps.lk/library-search-select.php?id=wh188"><i>Ideal Solitude</i></a>.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: “Bhikkhus.” — “Venerable sir,” they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p>“Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night.’<span class="note" id="n1210"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1210] In the first edition I followed Ñm in rendering <i>bhaddekaratta</i> as “one fortunate attachment.” At the suggestion of Ven. Thānissaro Bhikkhu, however, I have changed it to “a single excellent night,” which seems more likely to be correct. <i>Ratta</i> and <i>ratti</i> could be taken to represent respectively either Skt <i>rātra</i> and <i>rātri</i> (= night) or Skt <i>rakta</i> and <i>rakti</i> (= attachment). Ñm had taken the words in the latter sense, but the fact that neither MA nor M-ṭ glosses ratta implies that “night” is intended; for if the word were used to mean attachment, an unwholesome state in typical Buddhist discourse, some commentarial clarification would surely have been offered. The Central Asian Skt version, the Skt title at the head of the Tibetan version, and the Tibetan translation itself all use <i>bhadrakarātri.</i> This confirms the identification of <i>ratta</i> with “night”; the change from -e- to -a- can be understood as an attempt to convert a difficult reading into a more familiar one. (I am indebted to Peter Skilling for this information.) The Chinese Madhyama Āgama has merely transliterated the title of the Skt version and thus offers no help.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">Apart from this series of suttas, the expression bhaddekaratta does not occcur elsewhere in the Pali Canon. MA merely says: “‘A single-excellent-nighter’ is one with a single night who is excellent because of possessing application to insight” <i>(bhaddekarattassā ti vipassanāyogasamannāgatattā bhaddekassa ekarattassa)</i>. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">M-ṭ</a> simply gives word resolutions <i>(ekā ratti ekaratto; bhaddo ekaratto etassā ti bhaddekarattaṁ)</i> and says this refers to a person cultivating insight. As the verse emphasises the urgent need to conquer death by developing insight, the title probably describes a meditator who has had a single excellent night (and day) devoted to practising insight meditation “invincibly, unshakeably.” Ñm says in Ms: "It might be supposed that the expression <i>‘bhaddekaratta’</i> was a popular phrase taken over by the Buddha and given a special sense by him, as was not infrequently done, but there seems to be no reason to do so and there is no evidence for it in this case. It is more likely to be a term coined by the Buddha himself to describe a certain aspect of development."</span></span></span> Listen and attend closely to what I shall say.” — “Yes, venerable sir,” the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p2" class="verse"><span class="parno">2</span>“Let not a person revive the past
<br>Or on the future build his hopes;<span class="note" id="n1211"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1211] More literally the first two lines would be translated: “Let not a person run back to the past or live in expectation of the future.” The meaning will be elucidated in the expository passage of the sutta.</span></span></span>
<br>For the past has been left behind
<br>And the future has not been reached.</p>

<p id="p3" class="verse"><span class="parno">3</span>“Instead with insight let him see
<br>Each presently arisen state;<span class="note" id="n1212"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1212] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: He should contemplate each presently arisen state, just where it has arisen, by way of the seven contemplations of insight (insight into impermanence, suffering, non-self, disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, relinquishment).</span></span></span>
<br>Let him know that and be sure of it,
<br>Invincibly, unshakeably.<span class="note" id="n1213"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1213] <i>Asaṁhīraṁ asaṅkuppaṁ.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that this is said for the purpose of showing insight and counter-insight (see <a href="mn121.html#n1143">n.1143</a>); for insight is “invincible, unshakeable” because it is not vanquished or shaken by lust and other defilements. Elsewhere the expression “the invincible, the unshakeable” is used as a description of Nibbāna (e.g., <a href="../snp/snp5.18.html#1149">Sn v.1149</a>) or of the liberated mind (e.g., <a href="../tha/tha14.html#649">Thag v.649</a>), but here it seems to refer to a stage in the development of insight. The recurrence of the verb form <i>saṁhīrati</i> in ¶¶10–11 suggests that the intended meaning is contemplation of the present moment without being misled into the adoption of a view of self.</span></span></span>

<br>Who has had a single excellent night.</p>


<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>“How, bhikkhus, does one revive the past? One nurtures delight there thinking, ‘I had such material form in the past.’<span class="note" id="n1215"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1215] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: One "finds delight" by bringing to bear upon the past either craving or a view associated with craving. It should be noted that it is not the mere recollection of the past through memory that causes bondage, but the reliving of past experiences with thoughts of craving. In this respect the Buddha’s teaching differs significantly from that of Krishnamurti, who seems to regard memory itself as the villain behind the scene.</span></span></span> One nurtures delight there thinking, ‘I had such feeling in the past,’ … ‘I had such perception in the past,’ … ‘I had such formations in the past,’ … ‘I had such consciousness in the past.’ That is how one revives the past.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>“And how, bhikkhus, does one not revive the past? One does not nurture delight there thinking, ‘I had such material form in the past.’<span class="note" id="n1216"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1216] The syntax of the Pali allows this sentence to be inter-preted in two ways, as stating either that one thinks: “I had such form in the past,” yet does not find delight in that thought; or that one does not find delight in the past by thinking such a thought. Horner, Ñāṇananda (in <a href="https://www.bps.lk/library-search-select.php?id=wh188"><i>Ideal Solitude</i></a>), and Ñm (in Ms) construe the sentence in the former way; I had preserved Ñm's rendering in the first edition. On reconsideration, I now believe that the second interpretation is more true to the intention of the text. This also ties in better with the stanzas themselves, which enjoin the disciple not to dwell in the past and the future but to contemplate “each presently arisen state” just as it presents itself.</span></span></span> One does not nurture delight there thinking, ‘I had such feeling in the past,’ … ‘I had such perception in the past,’ … ‘I had such formations in the past,’ … ‘I had such consciousness in the past.’ That is how one does not revive the past.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>“And how, bhikkhus, does one build up hope upon the future? One nurtures delight there thinking, ‘May I have such material form in the future!’<span class="note" id="n1217"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1217] In the first edition, this sentence was rendered: “Thinking, ‘I may have such material form in the future,’ one finds delight in that.” In retrospect, it now seems to me more likely that the sentence expresses an exclamatory wish for the future.</span></span></span> One nurtures delight there thinking, ‘May I have such feeling in the future!’ … ‘May I have such perception in the future!’ … ‘May I have such formations in the future!’ … ‘May I have such consciousness in the future!’ That is how one builds up hope upon the future.</p>

He regards feeling as self … perception as self … formations as self … consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how one is vanquished in regard to presently arisen states.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>“And how, bhikkhus, is one invincible in regard to presently arisen states? Here, bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple, who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not regard material form as self, or self as possessed of material form, or material form as in self, or self as in material form. He does not regard feeling as self … perception as self … formations as self … consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness.
