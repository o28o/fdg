<section class="raw_sutta">  <!-- English and Pali -->
<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now on that occasion the venerable Lomasakangiya was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha's Park.<span class="note" id="n1221"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1221] According to the commentary to Thag, Ven. Lomasakangiya had been a bhikkhu in the time of the Buddha Kassapa. After the Buddha Kassapa had taught the Bhaddekaratta Sutta, a certain bhikkhu spoke about it to Lomasakangiya. Unable to understand it, he exclaimed: "In the future, may I be able to teach you this sutta!" The other answered: "May I ask you about it!" In the present age Lomasakangiya was born into a Sakyan family at Kapilavatthu, while the other bhikkhu became the god Candana.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then, when the night was well advanced, Candana, a young deity of beautiful appearance who illuminated the whole of Nigrodha's Park, approached the venerable Lomasakangiya. Standing at one side, Candana the young deity said to him:</p>

<hr>
<p>"Bhikkhu, do you remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’?"</p>

<p>"Friend, I do not remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night.’</p>

<p>But, friend, do you remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Bhikkhu, I too do not remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night.’ But, bhikkhu, do you remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’?"</p>

<p>"Friend, I do not remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night.’ But, friend, do you remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’?"</p>

<p>"Bhikkhu, I remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night.’"</p>

<p>"But, friend, in what way do you remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Bhikkhu, once the Blessed One was living among the gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three, on the Red Marble Stone at the root of the Pāricchattaka tree.<span class="note" id="n1222"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1222] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that this occurred in the seventh year after the Buddha’s enlightenment, at the time when he spent the three months of the rainy season in the heaven of the Thirty-three teaching the Abhidhamma to the gods who had assembled from ten thousand world-systems.</span></span></span> There the Blessed One recited the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’ to the gods of the heaven of the Thirty-three:</p>

<hr>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>‘Let not a person revive the past
<br>Or on the future build his hopes;
<br>For the past has been left behind
<br>And the future has not been reached.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Instead with insight let him see
<br>Each presently arisen state;
<br>Let him know that and be sure of it,
<br>Invincibly, unshakeably.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Today the effort must be made;
<br>Tomorrow Death may come, who knows?
<br>No bargain with Mortality
<br>Can keep him and his hordes away.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>But one who dwells thus ardently,
<br>Relentlessly, by day, by night — 
<br>It is he, the Peaceful Sage has said,
<br>Who has had a single excellent night.’</p>
</div>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Bhikkhu, I remember the stanza of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’ thus. Bhikkhu, learn the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night.’ Bhikkhu, master the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had A Single Excellent Night.’ Bhikkhu, remember the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night.’ Bhikkhu, the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night’ is beneficial, it belongs to the fundamentals of the holy life."</p>

<p>That is what was said by Candana the young deity, who thereupon vanished at once.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">7–10</span>Then, when the night was over, the venerable Lomasakangiya set his resting place in order, and taking his bowl and outer robe, set out to wander by stages to Sāvatthī. He at length arrived at Sāvatthī, and went to the Blessed One in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side, told the Blessed One all that had occurred, and said: "It would be good, venerable sir, if the Blessed One would teach me the summary and exposition of ‘One Who Has Had a Single Excellent Night.’"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Bhikkhu, do you know that young deity?"</p>

<p>"No, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"Bhikkhu, that young deity is named Candana. He heeds the Dhamma, gives it attention, engages it with all his mind, hears it with eager ears. So, bhikkhu, listen and attend closely to what I shall say."</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," the venerable Lomasakangiya replied to the Blessed One. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Let not a person revive the past
<br>Or on the future build his hopes;<span class="note" id="na1223"><span class="details"><span class="p">More literally the first two lines would be translated: "Let not a person run back to the past or live in expectation of the future." The meaning will be elucidated in the expository passage of the sutta.</span></span></span>
<br>For the past has been left behind
<br>And the future has not been reached.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Instead with insight let him see
<br>Each presently arisen state;<span class="note" id="na1224"><span class="details"><span class="p">MA: He should contemplate each presently arisen state, just where it has arisen, by way of the seven contemplations of insight (insight into impermanence, suffering, non-self, disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, relinquishment).</span></span></span>

<br>Let him know that and be sure of it,
<br>Invincibly, unshakeably.<span class="note" id="na1225"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i>Asaṁhīraṁ asaṅkuppaṁ.</i> MA explains that this is said for the purpose of showing insight and counter-insight (see <a href="mn121.html#n1143">n.1143</a>); for insight is "invincible, unshakeable" because it is not vanquished or shaken by lust and other defilements. Elsewhere the expression "the invincible, the unshakeable" is used as a description of Nibbāna (e.g., Sn v.1149) or of the liberated mind (e.g., Thag v.649), but here it seems to refer to a stage in the development of insight. The recurrence of the verb form saṁhīrati in verse 8 and verse 9 suggests that the intended meaning is contemplation of the present moment without being misled into the adoption of a view of self.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>Today the effort must be made;
