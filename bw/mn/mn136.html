<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Now on that occasion the venerable Samiddhi was living in a forest hut. Then the wanderer Potaliputta, while wandering and walking for exercise, went to the venerable Samiddhi and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said to the venerable Samiddhi:</p>

<p>"Friend Samiddhi, I heard and learned this from the recluse Gotama's own lips: ‘Bodily action is vain, verbal action is vain, only mental action is real.’ And: ‘There is that attainment on entering which one does not feel anything at all.’"<span class="note" id="n1226"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1226] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> says that Potaliputta did not actually hear this personally from the Buddha, but had heard a report that these statements were made by the Buddha. The former is a distorted version of the Buddha’s declaration at <a href="../mn/mn56.html#23">MN56.23</a> that mental action is the most reprehensible of the three types of deeds for the performance of evil action. The latter derives from the Buddha’s discussion of the cessation of perception in the Poṭṭhapāda Sutta (<a href="../dn/dn9.html">DN9</a>). MA glosses the word "vain" by "fruitless."</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Do not say so, friend Potaliputta, do not say so. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus: ‘Bodily action is vain, verbal action is vain, only mental action is real.’ But, friend, there is that attainment on entering which one does not feel anything at all."</p>

<p>"How long is it since you went forth, friend Samiddhi?"</p>

<p>"Not long, friend: three years."</p>

<p>"There now, what shall we say to the elder bhikkhus when a young bhikkhu thinks the Teacher is to be defended thus? Friend Samiddhi, having done an intentional action by way of body, speech, or mind, what does one feel?"</p>

<p>"Having done an intentional action by way of body, speech, or mind, one feels suffering, friend Potaliputta."</p>

<p>Then, neither approving nor disapproving of the venerable Samiddhi's words, the wanderer Potaliputta rose from his seat and departed.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Soon after the wanderer Potaliputta had left, the venerable Samiddhi went to the venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and reported to the venerable Ānanda his entire conversation with the wanderer Potaliputta.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>After he had spoken, the venerable Ānanda told him: "Friend Samiddhi, this conversation should be told to the Blessed One. Come, let us approach the Blessed One and tell him this. As the Blessed One explains to us, so we shall bear it in mind." — "Yes, friend," the venerable Samiddhi replied.</p>

<p id="4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the venerable Ānanda and the venerable Samiddhi went together to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side. The venerable Ānanda reported to the Blessed One the entire conversation between the venerable Samiddhi and the wanderer Potaliputta.</p>

<p>When he had finished, the Blessed One told the venerable Ānanda: "Ānanda, I do not even recall ever having seen the wanderer Potaliputta, so how could there have been this conversation? Though the wanderer Potaliputta's question should have been analysed before being answered, this misguided man Samiddhi answered it one-sidedly."</p>

<p>When this was said, the venerable Udāyin said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, perhaps the venerable Samiddhi spoke thus referring to <span class="add">the principle</span>: ‘Whatever is felt is included in suffering.’"<span class="note" id="n1227"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1227] This statement is made by the Buddha at <a href="../sn/sn36.11.html">SN&nbsp;36:11</a>, with reference to the suffering inherent in all formations by reason of their impermanence. Though the statement itself is true, Samiddhi seems to have misinterpreted it to mean that all feeling is felt as suffering, which is patently false.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then the Blessed One addressed the venerable Ānanda: "See, Ānanda, how this misguided man Udāyin interferes. I knew, Ānanda, that this misguided man Udāyin would unduly interfere right now. From the start the wanderer Potaliputta had asked about the three kinds of feeling. This misguided man Samiddhi would have answered the wanderer Potaliputta rightly if, when asked thus, he would have explained: ‘Friend Potaliputta, having done an intentional action by way of body, speech, or mind <span class="add">whose result is</span> to be felt as pleasant, one feels pleasure. Having done an intentional action by way of body, speech, or mind <span class="add">whose result is</span> to be felt as painful, one feels pain. Having done an intentional action by way of body, speech, or mind <span class="add">whose result is</span> to be felt as neither-pain-nor-pleasure, one feels neither-pain-nor-pleasure.’ But who are these foolish, thoughtless wanderers of other sects, that they could understand the Tathāgata's great exposition of action? You should listen, Ānanda, to the Tathāgata as he expounds the great exposition of action."</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"This is the time, Blessed One, this is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One to expound the great exposition of action. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it."</p>

<p>"Then listen, Ānanda, and attend closely to what I shall say."</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," the venerable Ānanda replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

What four? Here some person kills living beings, takes what is not given, misconducts himself in sensual pleasures, speaks falsehood, speaks maliciously, speaks harshly, gossips; he is covetous, has a mind of ill will, and holds wrong view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"But here some person kills living beings … and holds wrong view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a happy destination, even in the heavenly world.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Here some person abstains from killing living beings, from taking what is not given, from misconduct in sensual pleasures, from false speech, from malicious speech, from harsh speech, from gossip; he is not covetous, his mind is without ill will, and he holds right view.

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Here, Ānanda, by means of ardour, endeavour, devotion, diligence, and right attention, some recluse or brahmin attains such concentration of mind that, when his mind is concentrated, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees that person here who kills living beings … and holds wrong view, and he sees that on the dissolution of the body, after death, he has reappeared in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. He says thus: ‘Indeed, there are evil actions, there is result of misconduct; for I saw a person here who killed living beings … and held wrong view, and I see that on the dissolution of the body, after death, he has reappeared in a state of deprivation … even in hell.’ He says thus: ‘On the dissolution of the body, after death, everyone who kills living beings … and holds wrong view reappears in a state of deprivation … even in hell. Those who know thus know rightly; those who think otherwise are mistaken.’ Thus he obstinately adheres to what he himself has known, seen, and discovered, insisting: ‘Only this is true, anything else is wrong.’</p>

Although the Pali seems to be saying that he was necessarily reborn in hell on account of some action other than the one he was seen performing, this should not be understood as an apodictic pronouncement but only as a statement of possibility.

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>"Thus, Ānanda, there is action that is incapable and appears incapable; there is action that is incapable and appears capable; there is action that is capable and appears capable; and there is action that is capable and appears incapable."<span class="note" id="n1234"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1234] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains <i>abhabba,</i> incapable, as the unwholesome <i>(akusala)</i>, called "incapable" because it is devoid of the capacity for growth; and <i>bhabba,</i> capable, as the wholesome, called "capable" because it has the capacity for growth. This explanation sounds suspect; <i>bhabba</i> (Skt <i>bhavya</i>) may simply mean "potent, capable of producing results," without implying any particular moral valuation. MA gives two explanations of the tetrad. The first devolves on taking the suffix <i>-ābhāsa</i> to mean "outshine" or "overcome," and thus the four terms exemplify the way a kamma of one quality can "outshine" another in generating its result. The second explanation, which seems more cogent, takes <i>ābhāsa</i> to mean "appears," which I follow in the translation. On this explanation, the first type is illustrated by the person who kills living beings and is reborn in hell: his action is incapable (of good result) because it is unwholesome, and it appears incapable because, since he is reborn in hell, it seems to be the cause for his rebirth there. The second is illustrated by the person who kills living beings and is reborn in heaven: his action is incapable (of good result) because it is unwholesome, yet it appears capable because he is reborn in heaven; thus to the outside recluses and brahmins it seems to be the cause for his rebirth in heaven. The remaining two terms should be understood along the same lines, with appropriate changes.</span></span></span></p>
