<p>"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you the Dhamma that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing; I shall reveal a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure,<span class="note" id="n1328"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1328] This string of epithets, usually descriptions of the Dhamma as a whole, here serves to emphasise the importance of the discourse the Buddha is about to deliver.</span></span></span> that is, the six sets of six. Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." — "Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

The structure of the argument may be briefly set out thus: Whatever is self must be permanent; X is directly perceived to be impermanent, i.e., marked by rise and fall; therefore X is not self.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"If anyone says, ‘Forms are self’<span class="n1332"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1332] The full argument of the previous paragraph is repeated for each of the remaining five terms in each set of six.</span></span></span> The rise and fall of the forms are discerned, and since its rise and fall are discerned, it would follow: ‘My self rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Forms are self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"If anyone says, ‘Feeling is self’ The rise and fall of the feeling is discerned, and since its rise and fall is discerned, it would follow: ‘My feeling rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Feeling is self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self, eye-consciousness is not self, eye-contact is not self, feeling is not self.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"If anyone says, ‘Craving is self’ The rise and fall of craving is discerned, and since its rise and fall is discerned, it would follow: ‘My craving rises and falls.’ That is why it is not tenable for anyone to say, ‘Craving is self.’ Thus the eye is not self, forms are not self, eye-consciousness is not self, eye-contact is not self, feeling is not self, craving is not self.</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>"Seeing thus, bhikkhus, a well-taught noble disciple becomes disenchanted with the eye, disenchanted with forms, disenchanted with eye-consciousness, disenchanted with eye-contact, disenchanted with feeling, disenchanted with craving.</p>

<p>"Being disenchanted, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion <span class="add">his mind</span> is liberated.

But each time Sāriputta, Moggallāna, and the eighty great disciples taught it, sixty bhikkhus attained arahantship. In Sri Lanka the Elder Maliyadeva taught this sutta in sixty places, and each time sixty bhikkhus attained arahantship. But when the Elder Tipiṭaka Cūḷanāga taught this sutta to a vast assembly of humans and gods, at the end of the discourse a thousand bhikkhus attained arahantship, and among the gods only one remained a worldling.</span></span></span></p>
