<p>"Bhikkhus, I shall teach you a discourse on the great sixfold base. Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." — "Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"When one abides uninflamed by lust, unfettered, uninfatuated, contemplating danger, then the five aggregates affected by clinging are diminished for oneself in the future; and one's craving — which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in this or that — is abandoned. One's bodily and mental troubles are abandoned, one's bodily and mental torments are abandoned, one's bodily and mental fevers are abandoned, and one experiences bodily and mental pleasure.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"The view of a person such as this is right view. His intention is right intention, his effort is right effort, his mindfulness is right mindfulness, his concentration is right concentration. But his bodily action, his verbal action, and his livelihood have already been well purified earlier.<span class="note" id="n1341"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1341] The eight factors of the path mentioned here seem to pertain to the preliminary or mundane portion of the path. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MṬ</a> identifies them with the factors possessed by a person at the highest level of insight development, immediately prior to the emergence of the supramundane path. In this stage only the former five path factors are actively operative, the three factors of the morality group having been purified prior to the undertaking of insight meditation. But when the supramundane path arises, all eight factors occur simultaneously, the three factors of the morality group exercising the function of eradicating the defilements responsible for moral transgression in speech, action, and livelihood.</span></span></span> Thus this Noble Eightfold Path comes to fulfilment in him by development.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>When he develops this Noble Eightfold Path, the four foundations of mindfulness also come to fulfilment in him by development; the four right kinds of striving also come to fulfilment in him by development; the four bases for spiritual power also come to fulfilment in him by development; the five faculties also come to fulfilment in him by development; the five powers also come to fulfilment in him by development; the seven enlightenment factors also come to fulfilment in him by development.</p>

The former is present under the heading of right concentration, the latter under the heading of right view.</span></span></span> He fully understands by direct knowledge those things that should be fully understood by direct knowledge. He abandons by direct knowledge those things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge. He develops by direct knowledge those things that should be developed by direct knowledge. He realises by direct knowledge those things that should be realised by direct knowledge.<span class="note" id="n1343"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1343] These are the four functions exercised by the supramundane path: fully understanding the truth of suffering, abandoning the cause of suffering, realising the cessation of suffering, and developing the path leading to the end of suffering.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"And what things should be fully understood by direct knowledge? The answer to that is: the five aggregates affected by clinging, that is, the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate affected by clinging, the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging. These are the things that should be fully understood by direct knowledge.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"And what things should be abandoned by direct knowledge? Ignorance and craving for being. These are the things that should be abandoned by direct knowledge.</p>

Serenity and insight.<span class="note" id="n1344"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1344] Here serenity and insight represent the entire Noble Eightfold Path.</span></span></span> These are the things that should be developed by direct knowledge.</p>

True knowledge and deliverance.<span class="note" id="n1345"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.1345] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> identifies "true knowledge" with the knowledge of the path of arahantship, "deliverance" with the fruit of arahantship.
