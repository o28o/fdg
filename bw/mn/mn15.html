<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the venerable Mahā Moggallāna was living in the Bhagga country at Suṁsumāragira in the Bhesakalā Grove, the Deer Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Friends, bhikkhus." — "Friend," they replied. The venerable Mahā Moggallāna said this:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Friends, though a bhikkhu asks thus: ‘Let the venerable ones admonish me,<span class="note" id="n212"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.212] <i>Vadantu,</i> meaning literally "let them speak to me," has the implied sense: "Let them speak to me by way of instruction and exhortation" (MA).</span></span></span> I need to be admonished by the venerable ones,’ yet if he is difficult to admonish and possesses qualities that make him difficult to admonish, if he is impatient and does not take instruction rightly, then his companions in the holy life think that he should not be admonished or instructed, they think of him as a person not to be trusted.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>"Friends, these are called the qualities that make him easy to admonish.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p38"><span class="parno">38</span>"Now, friends, a bhikkhu ought to infer about himself in the following way:<span class="note" id="n215"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.215] It is from this passage that the sutta acquires its name.</span></span></span></p>

<p>(1) ‘A person with evil wishes and dominated by evil wishes is displeasing and disagreeable to me. If I were to have evil wishes and be dominated by evil wishes, I would be displeasing and disagreeable to others.’ A bhikkhu who knows this should arouse his mind thus: ‘I shall not have evil wishes and be dominated by evil wishes.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">39–53</span>(2–16) ‘A person who lauds himself and disparages others … A person who adheres to his own views, holds on to them tenaciously, and relinquishes them with difficulty is displeasing and disagreeable to me. If I were to adhere to my own views, hold on to them tenaciously, and relinquish them with difficulty, I would be displeasing and disagreeable to others.’ A bhikkhu who knows this should arouse his mind thus: ‘I shall not adhere to my own views, hold on to them tenaciously, and I shall relinquish them easily.’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p54"><span class="parno">54</span>"Now, friends, a bhikkhu should review himself thus:</p>

<p>(1) ‘Do I have evil wishes and am I dominated by evil wishes?’ If, when he reviews himself, he knows: ‘I have evil wishes, I am dominated by evil wishes,’ then he should make an effort to abandon those evil unwholesome states. But if, when he reviews himself, he knows: ‘I have no evil wishes, I am not dominated by evil wishes,’ then he can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome states.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">55–69</span>(2–16) Again, a bhikkhu should review himself thus: ‘Do I praise myself and disparage others?’ … he should make an effort to abandon those evil unwholesome states. But if, when he reviews himself, he knows: ‘I do not adhere to my own views …,’ then he can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome states.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p70"><span class="parno">70</span>"Friends, when a bhikkhu reviews himself thus, if he sees that these evil unwholesome states are not all abandoned in himself, then he should make an effort to abandon them all. But if, when he reviews himself thus, he sees that they are all abandoned in himself, then he can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome states.<span class="note" id="n216"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.216] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> The ancients called this sutta the "Bhikkhupātimokkha." A bhikkhu should review himself three times daily in the way described in the sutta. If he cannot do so three times, then he should do so twice, or, at the minimum, once.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p71"><span class="parno">71</span>"Just as when a woman — or a man — young, youthful, fond of ornaments, on viewing the image of her own face in a clear bright mirror or in a basin of clear water, sees a smudge or a blemish on it, she makes an effort to remove it, but if she sees no smudge or blemish on it, she becomes glad thus: ‘It is a gain for me that it is clean’; so too when a bhikkhu reviews himself thus … then he can abide happy and glad, training day and night in wholesome states."</p>

<p id="p72"><span class="parno">72</span>That is what the venerable Mahā Moggallāna said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Mahā Moggallāna's words.</p>
