<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." — "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Bhikkhus, that any bhikkhu who has not abandoned five wildernesses in the heart and not severed five shackles in the heart should come to growth, increase, and fulfilment in this Dhamma and Discipline — that is impossible.<span class="note" id="n217"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.217] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains <i>cetokhila,</i> translated "wilderness in the heart," as rigidity, rubbish, or a stump in the mind. It explains <i>cetaso vinibandha</i> as something that binds the mind, clenching it like a fist; hence "shackle in the heart." The former, as will be seen, consists of four cases of doubt, one of hate; the latter of five varieties of greed.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"What, bhikkhus, are the five wildernesses in the heart that he has not abandoned? Here a bhikkhu is doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and unconfident about the Teacher, and thus his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving. As his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving, that is the first wilderness in the heart that he has not abandoned.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Again, a bhikkhu is doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and unconfident about the Dhamma <span class="note" id="n218"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.218] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains "Dhamma" here as the scriptural teaching and penetration to the paths, fruits, and Nibbāna.

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Again, a bhikkhu is doubtful, uncertain, undecided, and unconfident about the training … As his mind does not incline to ardour … that is the fourth wilderness in the heart that he has not abandoned.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Again, a bhikkhu is angry and displeased with his companions in the holy life, resentful and callous towards them, and thus his mind does not incline to ardour, devotion, perseverance, and striving.
