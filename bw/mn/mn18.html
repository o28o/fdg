<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in the Sakyan country at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha's Park.</p>

<p>Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Kapilavatthu for alms. When he had wandered for alms in Kapilavatthu and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to the Great Wood for the day's abiding, and entering the Great Wood, sat down at the root of a bilva sapling for the day's abiding.</p>

<p>Daṇḍapāni the Sakyan, while walking and wandering for exercise, also went to the Great Wood, and when he had entered the Great Wood, he went to the bilva sapling where the Blessed One was and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one side leaning on his stick and asked the Blessed One: "What does the recluse assert, what does he proclaim?"<span class="note" id="n226"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.226] Daṇḍapāni, whose name means "stick-in-hand," was so called because he used to walk around ostentatiously with a golden walking stick, even though he was still young and healthy. According to <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA,</a> he sided with Devadatta, the Buddha’s arch foe, when the latter attempted to create a schism in the Buddha’s following. His manner of asking the question is arrogant and deliberately provocative.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Friend, I assert and proclaim <span class="add">my teaching</span> in such a way that one does not quarrel with anyone in the world with its gods, its Māras, and its Brahmās, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people; in such a way that perceptions no more underlie that brahmin who abides detached from sensual pleasures, without perplexity, shorn of worry, free from craving for any kind of being."<span class="note" id="n227"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.227] The first part of the Buddha’s reply directly counters Daṇḍapāni's aggressive attitude. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> quotes in this connection <a href="../sn/sn22.94.html">SN&nbsp;22:94</a>/iii.138: "Bhikkhus, I do not dispute with the world, it is the world that disputes with me. A speaker of Dhamma does not dispute with anyone in the world." The second part may be taken to mean that, for the arahant (spoken of here as "that brahmin" with reference to the Buddha himself), perceptions no longer awaken the dormant underlying tendencies to defilements, to be enumerated in ¶9.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>When this was said, Daṇḍapāni the Sakyan shook his head, wagged his tongue, and raised his eyebrows until his forehead was puckered in three lines.<span class="note" id="n228"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.228] This response seems to be an expression of frustration and bewilderment.</span></span></span> Then he departed, leaning on his stick.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">3–4</span>Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from meditation and went to Nigrodha's Park, where he sat down on a seat made ready for him and told the bhikkhus what had taken place.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then a certain bhikkhu asked the Blessed One:</p>

<p>"But, venerable sir, how does the Blessed One assert and proclaim <span class="add">his teaching</span> in such a way that he does not quarrel with anyone in the world with its gods, its Māras, and its Brahmās, in this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people? And, venerable sir, how is it that perceptions no more underlie the Blessed One, that brahmin who abides detached from sensual pleasures, without perplexity, shorn of worry, free from craving for any kind of being?" … of the underlying tendency to views, of the underlying tendency to doubt, of the underlying tendency to conceit, of the underlying tendency to desire for being, of the underlying tendency to ignorance; this is the end of resorting to rods and weapons, of quarrels, brawls, disputes, recrimination, malicious words, and false speech; here these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder."<span class="note" id="n229"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.229] The interpretation of this cryptic passage hinges on the word <i>papañca</i> and the compound <i>papañca-saññā-saṅkhā.</i> Ñm had translated the former as "diversification" and the latter as "calculations about perceptions of diversification." It seems, however, that the primary problem to which the term <i>papañca</i> points is not "diversification," which may be quite in place when the sensory field itself displays diversity, but the propensity of the worldling's imagination to erupt in an effusion of mental commentary that obscures the bare data of cognition. In a penetrative study, <i>Concept and Reality in Early Buddhism,</i> Bhikkhu Ñāṇananda explains <i>papañca</i> as "conceptual proliferation," and I follow him in substituting "proliferation" for Ñm's "diversification." The commentaries identify the springs of this proliferation as the three factors — craving, conceit, and views — on account of which the mind "embellishes" experience by interpreting it in terms of "mine," "I" and "my self." <i>Papañca</i> is thus closely akin to <i>maññanā,</i> "conceiving," in MN&nbsp;1 — <a href="mn1.html#n6">see&nbsp;n.6.</a></span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">The compound <i>papañca-saññā-saṅkhā</i> is more problematic. Ven. Ñāṇananda interprets it to mean "concepts characterised by the mind's prolific tendency," but this explanation still leaves the word <i>saññā</i> out of account. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> glosses <i>saṅkhā</i> by <i>koṭṭhāsa,</i> "portion," and says that <i>saññā</i> is either perception associated with <i>papañca</i> or <i>papañca</i> itself. I go along with Ñāṇananda in taking <i>saṅkhā</i> to mean concept or notion (Ñm's "calculation" is too literal) rather than portion. My decision to treat <i>saññā-saṅkhā</i> as a <i>dvanda</i> compound, "perceptions and notions," may be questioned, but as the expression <i>papañca-saññā-saṅkhā</i> occurs but rarely in the Canon and is never verbally analysed, no rendering is utterly beyond doubt. On alternative interpretations of its components, the expression might have been rendered "notions (arisen from) the proliferation of perceptions" or "perceptual notions (arisen from) proliferation."</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">The sequel will make it clear that the process of cognition is itself "the source through which perceptions and notions (born of) mental proliferation beset a man." If nothing in the process of cognition is found to delight in, to welcome, or to hold to, the underlying tendencies of the defilements will come to an end.</span></span></span></p>

<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Then, soon after the Blessed One had gone, the bhikkhus considered: "Now, friends, the Blessed One has risen from his seat and gone into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning. Now who will expound this in detail?" Then they considered: "The venerable Mahā Kaccāna is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life.<span class="note" id="n230"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.230] Ven. Mahā Kaccāna was declared by the Buddha to be the most eminent disciple in expounding the detailed meaning of a brief saying. <a href="mn133.html">MN&nbsp;133</a> and <a href="mn138.html">MN&nbsp;138</a> were also spoken by him under similar circumstances.</span></span></span> He is capable of expounding the detailed meaning. Suppose we went to him and asked him the meaning of this."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then the bhikkhus went to the venerable Mahā Kaccāna and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, they sat down to one side and told him what had taken place, adding: "Let the venerable Mahā Kaccāna expound it to us."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span><span class="add">The venerable Mahā Kaccāna replied:</span> "Friends, it is as though a man needing heartwood, seeking heartwood, wandering in search of heartwood, thought that heartwood should be sought for among the branches and leaves of a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, after he had passed over the root and the trunk. And so it is with you, venerable sirs, that you think that I should be asked about the meaning of this, after you passed the Blessed One by when you were face to face with the Teacher. For knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he is vision, he is knowledge, he is the Dhamma, he is the holy one;<span class="note" id="n231"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.231] <i>Cakkhubhūto ñāṇabhūto dhammabhūto brahmabhūto.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> He is vision in the sense that he is the leader in vision; he is knowledge in the sense that he makes things known; he is the Dhamma in the sense that he consists of the Dhamma that he utters verbally after considering it in his heart; he is Brahmā, the holy one, in the sense of the best.</span></span></span> he is the sayer, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the Deathless, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathāgata. That was the time when you should have asked the Blessed One the meaning. As he told you, so you should have remembered it."</p>

<p>"Surely, friend Kaccāna, knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees; he is vision … the Tathāgata. That was the time when we should have asked the Blessed One the meaning. As he told us, so we should have remembered it. Yet the venerable Mahā Kaccāna is praised by the Teacher and esteemed by his wise companions in the holy life. The venerable Mahā Kaccāna is capable of expounding the detailed meaning of this summary given in brief by the Blessed One without expounding the detailed meaning. Let the venerable Mahā Kaccāna expound it without finding it troublesome."</p>

<p>"Then listen, friends, and attend closely to what I shall say." — "Yes, friend," the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Mahā Kaccāna said this:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Friends, when the Blessed One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling after giving a summary in brief without expounding the detailed meaning, that is: ‘Bhikkhu, as to the source through which perceptions and notions <span class="add">born of</span> mental proliferation beset a man: if nothing is found there to delight in, welcome, and hold to, this is the end of the underlying tendency to lust … this is the end of resorting to rods and weapons … here these evil unwholesome states cease without remainder,’ I understand the detailed meaning of it to be as follows:</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Dependent on the eye and forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting of the three is contact. With contact as condition there is feeling. What one feels, that one perceives. What one perceives, that one thinks about. What one thinks about, that one mentally proliferates. With what one has mentally proliferated as the source, perceptions and notions <span class="add">born of</span> mental proliferation beset a man with respect to past, future, and present forms cognizable through the eye.<span class="note" id="n232"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.232] This passage shows how <i>papañca,</i> emerging from the process of cognition, gives rise to perceptions and notions that overwhelm and victimise their hapless creator. Ms contains a note by Ñm: "The meeting of eye, form, and eye-consciousness is called contact. Contact, according to dependent origination, is the principal condition of feeling. Feeling and perception are inseparable (<a href="mn43.html#p14">MN&nbsp;43.9</a>). What is perceived as ‘this’ is thought about in its differences and is thus diversified from ‘that’ and from ‘me.’ This diversification — involving craving for form, wrong view about permanence of form, etc., and the conceit ‘I am’ — leads to preoccupation with calculating the desirability of past and present forms with a view to obtaining desirable forms in the future. " Perhaps the key to the interpretation of this passage is Ven. Mahā Kaccāna's explanation of the Bhaddekaratta verses in <a href="mn133.html">MN&nbsp;133</a>. There too delight in the elements of cognition plays a prominent role in causing bondage, and the elaboration of the verses in terms of the three periods of time links up with the reference to the three times in this sutta.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Dependent on the ear and sounds … Dependent on the nose and odours … Dependent on the tongue and flavours … Dependent on the body and tangibles … Dependent on the mind and mind-objects, mind-consciousness arises.

Ñm originally rendered "that one will describe a description of contact." "To point out a manifestation" is less literal, but it should do justice to the meaning without jeopardising intelligibility. MA says that this passage is intended to show the entire round of existence <i>(vaṭṭa)</i> by way of the twelve sense bases; verse 18 shows the cessation of the round <i>(vaṭṭa)</i> by the negation of the twelve sense bases.</span></span></span> When there is the manifestation of contact, it is possible to point out the manifestation of feeling.

<hr>
<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>Then the bhikkhus, having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Mahā Kaccāna's words, rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told the Blessed One all that had taken place after he had left, adding: "Then, venerable sir, we went to the venerable Mahā Kaccāna and asked him about the meaning. The venerable Mahā Kaccāna expounded the meaning to us with these terms, statements, and phrases."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Mahā Kaccāna is wise, bhikkhus, Mahā Kaccāna has great wisdom. If you had asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to you in the same way that Mahā Kaccāna has explained it. Such is the meaning of this, and so you should remember it."</p>

<hr>
