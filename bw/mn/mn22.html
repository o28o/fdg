<h3><span class="add">Setting</span></h3>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n248"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.248] This sutta with a fine introduction and detailed notes is available in a translation by Nyanaponika Thera, <a href="http://www.bps.lk/library-search-select.php?id=wh048"><i>The Discourse on the Snake Simile.</i></a></span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

<p>Now on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named Ariṭṭha, formerly of the vulture killers, thus: "As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in them.<span class="note" id="n249"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.249] In making this assertion he directly contradicts the third of the four intrepidities of the Tathāgata — see <a href="mn12.html#p25">MN
&nbsp;.25</a>. According to MA, while reflecting in seclusion he came to the conclusion that there would be no harm if bhikkhus were to engage in sexual relations with women and he maintained that this should not be prohibited by the monastic rules. Though his statement does not expressly mention the sexual issue, the similes about sensual pleasures brought forth by the bhikkhus lend credence to the commentary.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Several bhikkhus, having heard about this, went to the bhikkhu Ariṭṭha and asked him: "Friend Ariṭṭha, is it true that such a pernicious view has arisen in you?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Exactly so, friends. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in them."</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">3–7</span>Then these bhikkhus, desiring to detach him from that pernicious view, pressed and questioned and cross-questioned him thus: "Friend Ariṭṭha, do not say so. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus. For in many ways the Blessed One has stated how obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in them. The Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more. <span class="note" id="n250"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.250] The first seven similes for sense pleasures are expanded upon at <a href="../mn/mn54.html#14">MN&nbsp;54.14–35</a></span></span></span>. With the simile of the skeleton … with the simile of the piece of meat … with the simile of the grass torch … with the simile of the pit of coals … with the simile of the dream … with the simile of the borrowed goods … with the simile of fruits on a tree … with the simile of the butcher's knife and block … with the simile of the sword stake … with the simile of the snake's head, the Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more.ʺ</p>

<hr>
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Yet although pressed and questioned and cross-questioned by those bhikkhus in this way, the bhikkhu Ariṭṭha, formerly of the vulture killers, still obstinately adhered to that pernicious view and continued to insist upon it. Since the bhikkhus were unable to detach him from that pernicious view, they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurred, adding: "Venerable sir, since we could not detach the bhikkhu Ariṭṭha, formerly of the vulture killers, from this pernicious view, we have reported this matter to the Blessed One."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: "Come, bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhu Ariṭṭha, formerly of the vulture killers, in my name that the Teacher calls him." — "Yes, venerable sir," he replied, and he went to the bhikkhu Ariṭṭha and told him: "The Teacher calls you, friend Ariṭṭha."</p>

<p>"Yes, friend," he replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One then asked him: "Ariṭṭha, is it true that the following pernicious view has arisen in you: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in them’?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Exactly so, venerable sir. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, those things called obstructions by the Blessed One are not able to obstruct one who engages in them."</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Misguided man, to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in that way? Misguided man, have I not stated in many ways how obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in them? I have stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more. With the simile of the skeleton … with the simile of the piece of meat … with the simile of the grass torch … with the simile of the pit of coals … with the simile of the dream … with the simile of the borrowed goods … with the simile of fruits on a tree … with the simile of the butcher's knife and block … with the simile of the sword stake … with the simile of the snake's head, I have stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more. But you, misguided man, by your wrong grasp have misrepresented us, injured yourself, and stored up much demerit; for this will lead to your harm and suffering for a long time.ʺ<span class="note" id="n251"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.251] This first part of the Ariṭṭha episode occurs twice in the Vinaya Pịaka. At <a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc68.html">Vin ii.25</a> it leads to the Saṅgha announcing an act of suspension <i>(ukkhepaniyakamma)</i> against Ariṭṭha for refusing to give up his wrong view. At Vin iv.133–34 his refusal to give up his wrong view after repeated admonitions is defined as a monastic offence of the Pācittiya class.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Has this bhikkhu Ariṭṭha, formerly of the vulture killers, kindled even a spark of wisdom in this Dhamma and Discipline?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"How could he, venerable sir? No, venerable sir."</p>

<p>When this was said, the bhikkhu Ariṭṭha, formerly of the vulture killers, sat silent, dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and without response. Then, knowing this, the Blessed One told him: "Misguided man, you will be recognised by your own pernicious view. I shall question the bhikkhus on this matter."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, do you understand the Dhamma taught by me as this bhikkhu Ariṭṭha, formerly of the vulture killers, does when by his wrong grasp he misrepresents us, injures himself and stores up much demerit?"</p>

<p>"No, venerable sir. For in many ways the Blessed One has stated how obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in them. The Blessed One has stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more. With the simile of the skeleton … with the simile of the snake's head, the Blessed One has stated … that the danger in them is still more."</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>" Good, bhikkhus. It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me thus. For in many ways I have stated how obstructive things are obstructions, and how they are able to obstruct one who engages in them.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>I have stated that sensual pleasures provide little gratification, much suffering and despair, and that the danger in them is still more. With the simile of the skeleton … with the simile of the snake's head, I have stated … that the danger in them is still more. But this bhikkhu Ariṭṭha, formerly of the vulture killers, by his wrong grasp misrepresents us, injures himself, and stores up much demerit; for this will lead to this misguided man's harm and suffering for a long time.</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, that one can engage in sensual pleasures without sensual desires, without perceptions of sensual desire, without thoughts of sensual desire — that is impossible.<span class="note" id="n252"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.252] Though the Pali uses the one word <i>kāma</i> in all four cases, from the context the first phrase must be understood to refer to objective sensual pleasures, i.e., sensually enjoyable objects, the other phrases to refer to subjective defilements connected with sensuality, i.e ., sensual desire. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> glosses "that one can engage in sensual pleasures" with "that one can indulge in sexual intercourse." sures" with "that one can indulge in sexual intercourse." MṬ says that other physical acts expressive of sexual desire such as hugging and stroking should be included.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">The Simile of the Snake</span></h3>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"Here, bhikkhus, some misguided men learn the Dhamma — discourses, stanzas, expositions, verses, exclamations, sayings, birth stories, marvels, and answers to questions — but having learned the Dhamma, they do not examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Not examining the meaning of those teachings with wisdom, they do not gain a reflective acceptance of them. Instead they learn the Dhamma only for the sake of criticising others and for winning in debates, and they do not experience the good for the sake of which they learned the Dhamma. Those teachings, being wrongly grasped by them, conduce to their harm and suffering for a long time.<span class="note" id="n253"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.253] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that this passage is stated in order to show the fault in wrongly motivated acquisition of intellectual knowledge of the Dhamma — apparently the pitfall into which Ariṭṭha fell. The "good <i>(attha)</i> for the sake of which they learned the Dhamma" is the paths and fruits.</span></span></span> Why is that? Because of the wrong grasp of those teachings.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"Suppose a man needing a snake, seeking a snake, wandering in search of a snake, saw a large snake and grasped its coils or its tail. It would turn back on him and bite his hand or his arm or one of his limbs, and because of that he would come to death or deadly suffering. Why is that? Because of his wrong grasp of the snake. So too, here some misguided men learn the Dhamma … Why is that? Because of the wrong grasp of those teachings.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"Here, bhikkhus, some clansmen learn the Dhamma — discourses … answers to questions — and having learned the Dhamma, they examine the meaning of those teachings with wisdom. Examining the meaning of those teachings with wisdom, they gain a reflective acceptance of them. They do not learn the Dhamma for the sake of criticising others and for winning in debates, and they experience the good for the sake of which they learned the Dhamma. Those teachings, being rightly grasped by them, conduce to their welfare and happiness for a long time. Why is that? Because of the right grasp of those teachings.</p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"Suppose a man needing a snake, seeking a snake, wandering in search of a snake, saw a large snake and caught it rightly with a cleft stick, and having done so, grasped it rightly by the neck. Then although the snake might wrap its coils round his hand or his arm or his limbs, still he would not come to death or deadly suffering because of that. Why is that? Because of his right grasp of the snake. So too, here some clansmen learn the Dhamma … Why is that? Because of the right grasp of those teachings.</p>

<hr>
<p>"Therefore, bhikkhus, when you understand the meaning of my statements, remember it accordingly; and when you do not understand the meaning of my statements, then ask either me about it or those bhikkhus who are wise.</p>

<h3><span class="add">The Simile of the Raft</span></h3>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"Bhikkhus, I shall show you how the Dhamma is similar to a raft, being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping.<span class="note" id="n254"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.254] This famous "simile of the raft" continues the same argument against misuse of learning introduced by the simile of the snake. One who is preoccupied with using the Dhamma to stir up controversy and win debates carries the Dhamma around on his head instead of using it to cross the flood.</span></span></span> Listen and attend closely to what I shall say." — "Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"Bhikkhus, suppose a man in the course of a journey saw a great expanse of water, whose near shore was dangerous and fearful and whose further shore was safe and free from fear, but there was no ferryboat or bridge for going to the far shore. Then he thought: ‘There is this great expanse of water, whose near shore is dangerous and fearful and whose further shore is safe and free from fear, but there is no ferryboat or bridge for going to the far shore. Suppose I collect grass, twigs, branches, and leaves and bind them together into a raft, and supported by the raft and making an effort with my hands and feet, I got safely across to the far shore.’ And then the man collected grass, twigs, branches, and leaves and bound them together into a raft, and supported by the raft and making an effort with his hands and feet, he got safely across to the far shore. Then, when he had got across and had arrived at the far shore, he might think thus: ‘This raft has been very helpful to me, since supported by it and making an effort with my hands and feet, I got safely across to the far shore. Suppose I were to hoist it on my head or load it on my shoulder, and then go wherever I want.’ Now, bhikkhus, what do you think? By doing so, would that man be doing what should be done with that raft?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"No, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"By doing what would that man be doing what should be done with that raft? Here, bhikkhus, when that man got across and had arrived at the far shore, he might think thus: ‘This raft has been very helpful to me, since supported by it and making an effort with my hands and feet, I got safely across to the far shore. Suppose I were to haul it onto the dry land or set it adrift in the water, and then go wherever I want.’ Now, bhikkhus, it is by so doing that that man would be doing what should be done with that raft. So I have shown you how the Dhamma is similar to a raft, being for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of grasping.</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, when you know the Dhamma to be similar to a raft, you should abandon even the teachings, how much more so things contrary to the teachings.<span class="note" id="n255"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.255] <i>Dhammā pi vo pahātabbā pageva adhammā.</i> The word <i>dhammā</i> is ambiguous here. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> interprets it as meaning good states, which it identifies with serenity and insight <i>(samatha-vipassanā)</i> thus in its paraphrase of the text: "I teach, bhikkhus, even the abandoning of desire and attachment to such peaceful and sublime states as serenity and insight, how much more so to that low, vulgar, contemptible, coarse, and impure thing that this foolish Ariṭṭha sees as harmless when he says that there is no obstruction in desire and lust for the five cords of sensual pleasure." The commentator cites <a href="mn66.html#p37">MN&nbsp;66.26–33</a> as an example of the Buddha teaching the abandonment of attachment to serenity, <a href="mn38..html#p14">MN&nbsp;38.14</a> as an example of his teaching the abandonment of attachment to insight. Note that in each case it is the attachment to the good states that should be abandoned, not the good states themselves.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">Despite MA, it seems to me that <i>dhammā</i> here signifies, not good states themselves, but the teachings, the correct attitude to which was delineated just above in the simile of the snake. The simile of the raft thus intimates that even the teachings that are to be rightly grasped must finally be relinquished. This, however, is not an invitation to moral nihilism, but a warning that even attachment to the noble teachings is an obstacle to progress. What is contrary to the teachings, adhammā, would include the moral laxity that the bhikkhu Ariṭṭha advocated.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Standpoints for Views</span></h3>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>"Bhikkhus, there are these six standpoints for views.<span class="note" id="n256"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.256] This section evidently has the purpose of forestalling another type of misconception and misrepresentation of the Dhamma, i.e., the introduction of a view of self into the teaching. According to MA, standpoints for views <i>(diṭṭhiṭṭhāna)</i> are wrong views themselves as grounds for other more elaborate wrong views; the objects of views, i.e., the five aggregates; and the conditions for views, i.e., such factors as ignorance, perverted perception, and false thoughts, etc.</span></span></span> What are the six? Here, bhikkhus, an untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards material form thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self.ʹ<span class="note" id="n257"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.257] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> states that the notion "this is mine" is induced by craving, the notion "this I am" by conceit, and the notion "this is my self" by wrong views. These three — craving, conceit, and views — are called the three obsessions <i>(gāha)</i>.
