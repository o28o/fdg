<hr>
<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living in Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus."<span class="note" id="n51"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.51] MA: The Buddha delivered this sutta because many bhikkhus were becoming elated over the gains and honour accruing to the Saṅgha, to the neglect of their spiritual training. The Buddha obviously could not lay down a training rule prohibiting the use of the requisites, but he wanted to show the practice of the heirs in Dhamma to those bhikkhus who were earnestly desirous of training.</span></span></span> — "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things. Out of compassion for you I have thought: ‘How shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?’ If you are my heirs in material things, not my heirs in Dhamma, you will be reproached thus: ‘The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in material things, not as heirs in Dhamma’; and I will be reproached thus: ‘The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in material things, not as his heirs in Dhamma.’<br>"If you are my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things, you will not be reproached <span class="add">as it will be said</span>: ‘The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in Dhamma, not as his heirs in material things’; and I will not be reproached <span class="add">as it will be said</span>: ‘The Teacher's disciples live as his heirs in Dhamma, not as his heirs in material things.’ Therefore, bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things. Out of compassion for you I have thought: ‘How shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Now, bhikkhus, suppose that I had eaten, refused more food, had my fill, finished, had enough, had what I needed, and some almsfood was left over to be thrown away. Then two bhikkhus arrived hungry and weak, and I told them: ‘Bhikkhus, I have eaten … had what I needed, but there is this almsfood of mine left over to be thrown away. Eat if you like; if you do not eat then I shall throw it away where there is no greenery or drop it into water where there is no life.’</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then one bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One has eaten … had what he needed, but there is this almsfood of the Blessed One left over to be thrown away; if we do not eat it the Blessed One will throw it away … But this has been said by the Blessed One: "Bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things." Now this almsfood is one of the material things. Suppose that instead of eating this almsfood I pass the night and day hungry and weak.’ And instead of eating that almsfood he passed that night and day hungry and weak.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then the second bhikkhu thought: ‘The Blessed One has eaten … had what he needed, but there is this almsfood of the Blessed One left over to be thrown away … Suppose that I eat this almsfood and pass the night and day neither hungry nor weak.’ And after eating that almsfood he passed the night and day neither hungry nor weak.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Now although that bhikkhu by eating that almsfood passed the night and day neither hungry nor weak, yet the first bhikkhu is more to be respected and commended by me. Why is that? Because that will for long conduce to his fewness of wishes, contentment, effacement, easy support, and arousal of energy.<span class="note" id="n52"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.52] MA explains that these five qualities gradually fulfil all the stages of the practice culminating in arahantship.</span></span></span> Therefore, bhikkhus, be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things. Out of compassion for you I have thought: ‘How shall my disciples be my heirs in Dhamma, not my heirs in material things?’"</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>That is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Sublime One rose from his seat and went into his dwelling.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Soon after he had left, the venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Friends, bhikkhus." — "Friend," they replied. The venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Friends, in what way do disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded not train in seclusion? And in what way do disciples of the Teacher who lives secluded train in seclusion?" "Indeed, friend, we would come from far away to learn from the venerable Sāriputta the meaning of this statement. It would be good if the venerable Sāriputta would explain the meaning of this statement. Having heard it from him the bhikkhus will remember it."<br>"Then, friends, listen and attend closely to what I shall say."<br>"Yes, friend," the bhikkhus replied. The venerable Sāriputta said this:</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Friends, the evil herein is greed and hate.<span class="note" id="n54"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.54] The evil qualities mentioned here, and in the sections that follow, are introduced to show the states referred to above (verse 6) by the statement: "They do not abandon what the Teacher tells them to abandon." They are also the factors that induce a bhikkhu to become an heir of material things rather than an heir of Dhamma. In <a href="mn7.html#p3">MN&nbsp;7.3</a> the same sixteen qualities, with "ill will" substituted for "hate," are referred to as "the imperfections that defile the mind" <i>(<i>cittas’ upakkilesā</i>)</i>. See <a href="mn7.html#n87">n.&nbsp;87</a> below.</span></span></span> There is a Middle Way for the abandoning of greed and hate, giving vision, giving knowledge, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. And what is that Middle Way? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration. This is the Middle Way giving vision, giving knowledge, which leads to peace, to direct knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.<span class="note" id="n55"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.55] The Noble Eightfold Path is introduced here to show the practice that makes one an "heir in Dhamma."The antithesis between the defilements and the path restates, from a new angle, the contrast between "heirs in material things" and "heirs in Dhamma" with which the Buddha had opened the sutta.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"The evil herein is anger and resentment … contempt and insolence … envy and avarice … deceit and fraud … obstinacy and rivalry … conceit and arrogance … vanity and negligence.

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>That is what the venerable Sāriputta said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the venerable Sāriputta's words.</p>
