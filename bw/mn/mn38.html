<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>

<p>Now at that time a mendicant called Sāti, the fisherman’s son, had the following harmful misconception: “As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”</p>

<p>Several mendicants heard about this. They went up to Sāti and said to him: “Is it really true, Reverend Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely, reverends. As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”</p>

<p>Then, wishing to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants pursued, pressed, and grilled him: “Don’t say that, Sāti! Don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for misrepresentation of the Buddha is not good. And the Buddha would not say that. In many ways the Buddha has said that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause.”</p>

<p>But even though the mendicants pressed him in this way, Sāti obstinately stuck to his misconception and insisted on stating it.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>When they weren’t able to dissuade Sāti from his view, the mendicants went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>So the Buddha said to a certain monk: “Please, monk, in my name tell the mendicant Sāti that the teacher summons him.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” that monk replied. He went to Sāti and said to him: “Reverend Sāti, the teacher summons you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, reverend,” Sāti replied. He went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down to one side. The Buddha said to him: “Is it really true, Sāti, that you have such a harmful misconception: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another’?”</p>

<p>“Absolutely, sir. As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it is this very same consciousness that roams and transmigrates, not another.”</p>

<hr>

<p>“Sāti, what is that consciousness?”</p>

<p>“Sir, it is he who speaks and feels and experiences the results of good and bad deeds in all the different realms.”</p>

<p>“Silly man, who on earth have you ever known me to teach in that way? Haven’t I said in many ways that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause? But still you misrepresent me by your wrong grasp, harm yourself, and make much bad karma. This will be for your lasting harm and suffering.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: “What do you think, mendicants? Has this mendicant Sāti kindled even a spark of wisdom in this teaching and training?”</p>

<p>“How could that be, sir? No, sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>When this was said, Sāti sat silent, embarrassed, shoulders drooping, downcast, depressed, with nothing to say. Knowing this, the Buddha said: “Silly man, you will be known by your own harmful misconception. I’ll question the mendicants about this.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Then the Buddha said to the mendicants: “Mendicants, do you understand my teachings as Sāti does, when he misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and makes much bad karma?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. For in many ways the Buddha has told us that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause.”</p>

<p>“Good, good, mendicants! It’s good that you understand my teaching like this. For in many ways I have told you that consciousness is dependently originated, since consciousness does not arise without a cause. But still this Sāti misrepresents me by his wrong grasp, harms himself, and makes much bad karma. This will be for his lasting harm and suffering.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Consciousness is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it arises. Consciousness that arises dependent on the eye and sights is reckoned as eye consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the ear and sounds is reckoned as ear consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the nose and smells is reckoned as nose consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the tongue and tastes is reckoned as tongue consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the body and touches is reckoned as body consciousness. Consciousness that arises dependent on the mind and thoughts is reckoned as mind consciousness.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>It’s like fire, which is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it burns. A fire that burns dependent on logs is reckoned as a log fire. A fire that burns dependent on twigs is reckoned as a twig fire. A fire that burns dependent on grass is reckoned as a grass fire. A fire that burns dependent on cow-dung is reckoned as a cow-dung fire. A fire that burns dependent on husks is reckoned as a husk fire. A fire that burns dependent on rubbish is reckoned as a rubbish fire.</p>

<p>In the same way, consciousness is reckoned according to the specific conditions dependent upon which it arises. …</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Mendicants, do you see that this has come to be?”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>“Pure and bright as this view is, mendicants, if you cherish it, fancy it, treasure it, and treat it as your own, would you be understanding how the Dhamma is similar to a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on?”</p>

<p id="p39"><span class="parno">39</span>“Pure and bright as this view is, mendicants, if you don’t cherish it, fancy it, treasure it, and treat it as your own, would you be understanding how the Dhamma is similar to a raft: for crossing over, not for holding on?”</p>

<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>“Mendicants, there are these four fuels. They maintain sentient beings that have been born and help those that are about to be born. What four? Solid food, whether coarse or fine; contact is the second, mental intention the third, and consciousness the fourth.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>What is the source, origin, birthplace, and root of these four fuels? Craving.</p>

<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>And what is the source of craving? Feeling.</p>

<p id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>And what is the source of feeling? Contact.</p>

<p><p id="p49"><span class="parno">49</span>And what is the source of choices? Ignorance.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>So, ignorance is a condition for choices. Choices are a condition for consciousness. Consciousness is a condition for name and form. Name and form are conditions for the six sense fields. The six sense fields are conditions for contact. Contact is a condition for feeling. Feeling is a condition for craving. Craving is a condition for grasping. Grasping is a condition for continued existence. Continued existence is a condition for rebirth. Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.</p>

<p id="p92"><span class="parno">92</span>Mendicants, when three things come together an embryo is conceived. In a case where the mother and father come together, but the mother is not in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle, and the spirit being reborn is not present, the embryo is not conceived. In a case where the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle, but the spirit being reborn is not present, the embryo is not conceived. But when these three things come together — the mother and father come together, the mother is in the fertile part of her menstrual cycle, and the spirit being reborn is present — an embryo is conceived.</p>

<p>The mother nurtures the embryo in her womb for nine or ten months at great risk to her heavy burden. When nine or ten months have passed, the mother gives birth at great risk to her heavy burden. When the infant is born she nourishes it with her own blood. For mother’s milk is regarded as blood in the training of the noble one.</p>

<p>Being so full of favoring and opposing, when they experience any kind of feeling — pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral — they approve, welcome, and keep clinging to it. This gives rise to relishing.

Rebirth is a condition for old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress to come to be. That is how this entire mass of suffering originates.</p>

<p id="p95"><span class="parno">95</span>But consider when a Realized One arises in the world, perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed. He has realized with his own insight this world — with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans — and he makes it known to others. He proclaims a teaching that is good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing. He reveals an entirely full and pure spiritual life.</p>

<p>A householder hears that teaching, or a householder’s child, or someone reborn in some good family. They gain faith in the Realized One, and reflect, ‘Living in a house is cramped and dirty, but the life of one gone forth is wide open. It’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?’ After some time they give up a large or small fortune, and a large or small family circle. They shave off hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>

<p id="p96"><span class="parno">96</span>Once they’ve gone forth, they take up the training and livelihood of the mendicants. They give up killing living creatures, renouncing the rod and the sword. They’re scrupulous and kind, living full of compassion for all living beings.</p>

<p id="p97"><span class="parno">97</span>They give up stealing. They take only what’s given, and expect only what’s given. They keep themselves clean by not thieving.</p>

<p id="p98"><span class="parno">98</span>They give up unchastity. They are celibate, set apart, avoiding the common practice of sex.</p>

<p id="p99"><span class="parno">99</span>They give up lying. They speak the truth and stick to the truth. They’re honest and trustworthy, and don’t trick the world with their words.</p>

<p id="p100"><span class="parno">100</span>They give up divisive speech. They don’t repeat in one place what they heard in another so as to divide people against each other. Instead, they reconcile those who are divided, supporting unity, delighting in harmony, loving harmony, speaking words that promote harmony.</p>

<p id="p101"><span class="parno">101</span>They give up harsh speech. They speak in a way that’s mellow, pleasing to the ear, lovely, going to the heart, polite, likable and agreeable to the people.</p>

<p id="p102"><span class="parno">102</span>They give up talking nonsense. Their words are timely, true, and meaningful, in line with the teaching and training. They say things at the right time which are valuable, reasonable, succinct, and beneficial.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p103"><span class="parno">103</span>They avoid injuring plants and seeds. They eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time. They avoid dancing, singing, music, and seeing shows. They avoid beautifying and adorning themselves with garlands, perfumes, and makeup. They avoid high and luxurious beds. They avoid receiving gold and money, raw grains, raw meat, women and girls, male and female bondservants, goats and sheep, chickens and pigs, elephants, cows, horses, and mares, and fields and land. They avoid running errands and messages; buying and selling; falsifying weights, metals, or measures; bribery, fraud, cheating, and duplicity; mutilation, murder, abduction, banditry, plunder, and violence.</p>

<p id="p104"><span class="parno">104</span>They’re content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. They’re like a bird: wherever it flies, wings are its only burden. In the same way, a mendicant is content with robes to look after the body and alms-food to look after the belly. Wherever they go, they set out taking only these things. When they have this entire spectrum of noble ethics, they experience a blameless happiness inside themselves.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p105"><span class="parno">105</span>When they see a sight with their eyes, they don’t get caught up in the features and details. If the faculty of sight were left unrestrained, bad unskillful qualities of desire and aversion would become overwhelming.

<hr>

<p id="p106"><span class="parno">106</span>They act with situational awareness when going out and coming back; when looking ahead and aside; when bending and extending the limbs; when bearing the outer robe, bowl and robes; when eating, drinking, chewing, and tasting; when urinating and defecating; when walking, standing, sitting, sleeping, waking, speaking, and keeping silent.</p>

<p id="p107"><span class="parno">107</span>When they have this noble spectrum of ethics, this noble sense restraint, and this noble mindfulness and situational awareness, they frequent a secluded lodging — a wilderness, the root of a tree, a hill, a ravine, a mountain cave, a charnel ground, a forest, the open air, a heap of straw.</p>

<p>After the meal, they return from alms-round, sit down cross-legged with their body straight, and establish mindfulness right there. Giving up desire for the world, they meditate with a heart rid of desire, cleansing the mind of desire. Giving up ill will and malevolence, they meditate with a mind rid of ill will, full of compassion for all living beings, cleansing the mind of ill will. Giving up dullness and drowsiness, they meditate with a mind rid of dullness and drowsiness, perceiving light, mindful and aware, cleansing the mind of dullness and drowsiness. Giving up restlessness and remorse, they meditate without restlessness, their mind peaceful inside, cleansing the mind of restlessness and remorse. Giving up doubt, they meditate having gone beyond doubt, not undecided about skillful qualities, cleansing the mind of doubt.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p108"><span class="parno">108</span>They give up these five hindrances, corruptions of the heart that weaken wisdom. Then, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, they enter and remain in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. Furthermore, as the placing of the mind and keeping it connected are stilled, a mendicant enters and remains in the second absorption … third absorption … fourth absorption.</p>

<p id="p109"><span class="parno">109</span>When they see a sight with their eyes, if it’s pleasant they don’t desire it, and if it’s unpleasant they don’t dislike it. They live with mindfulness of the body established and a limitless heart.

<p>Having given up favoring and opposing, when they experience any kind of feeling — pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral — they don’t approve, welcome, or keep clinging to it. As a result, relishing of feelings ceases. When their relishing ceases, grasping ceases. When grasping ceases, continued existence ceases. When continued existence ceases, rebirth ceases. When rebirth ceases, old age and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress cease. </p>

<p>That is how this entire mass of suffering ceases.</p>

<p>Mendicants, you should memorize that brief statement on freedom through the ending of craving. But the mendicant Sāti, the fisherman’s son, is caught in a vast net of craving, a tangle of craving.”</p>
