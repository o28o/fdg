<h3><span class="add">Setting</span></h3>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

<hr>
<p>Now on that occasion a pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named Sāti, son of a fisherman, thus: "As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another."<span class="note" id="n402"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.402] According to <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA,</a> through faulty reasoning based on the fact of rebirth, Sāti came to the conclusion that a persisting consciousness transmigrating from one existence to another is necessary to explain rebirth. The first part of the sutta (down to verse 8) replicates the opening of <a href="mn22.html">MN&nbsp;22</a>, the only difference being in the view espoused.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>Several bhikkhus, having heard about this, went to the bhikkhu Sāti and asked him: "Friend Sāti, is it true that such a pernicious view has arisen in you?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Exactly so, friends. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another." Then those bhikkhus, desiring to detach him from that pernicious view, pressed and questioned and cross-questioned him thus: "Friend Sāti, do not say so. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One; it is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus. For in many ways the Blessed One has stated consciousness to be dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no origination of consciousness."</p>

<p>Yet although pressed and questioned and cross-questioned by those bhikkhus in this way, the bhikkhu Sāti, son of a fisherman, still obstinately adhered to that pernicious view and continued to insist upon it.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Since the bhikkhus were unable to detach him from that pernicious view, they went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, they sat down at one side and told him all that had occurred, adding: "Venerable sir, since we could not detach the bhikkhu Sāti, son of a fisherman, from this pernicious view, we have reported this matter to the Blessed One."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then the Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu thus: "Come, bhikkhu, tell the bhikkhu Sāti, son of a fisherman, in my name that the Teacher calls him." — "Yes, venerable sir," he replied, and he went to the bhikkhu Sāti and told him: "The Teacher calls you, friend Sāti."</p>

<p>"Yes, friend," he replied, and he went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, sat down at one side. The Blessed One then asked him: "Sāti, is it true that the following pernicious view has arisen in you: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another’?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so, venerable sir. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, it is this same consciousness that runs and wanders through the round of rebirths, not another."</p>

<hr>
<p>"What is that consciousness, Sāti?"</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, it is that which speaks and feels and experiences here and there the result of good and bad actions."<span class="note" id="n403"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.403] This is the last of the six views described at MN&nbsp;2.8. See <a href="mn2.html#n40">n.40.</a></span></span></span></p>

<p>"Misguided man, to whom have you ever known me to teach the Dhamma in that way? Misguided man, have I not stated in many ways consciousness to be dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no origination of consciousness? But you, misguided man, have misrepresented us by your wrong grasp and injured yourself and stored up much demerit; for this will lead to your harm and suffering for a long time."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, what do you think? Has this bhikkhu Sāti, son of a fisherman, kindled even a spark of wisdom in this Dhamma and Discipline?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"How could he, venerable sir? No, venerable sir."</p>

<p>When this was said, the bhikkhu Sāti, son of a fisherman, sat silent, dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and without response. Then, knowing this, the Blessed One told him: "Misguided man, you will be recognised by your own pernicious view. I shall question the bhikkhus on this matter."</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus, do you understand the Dhamma taught by me as this bhikkhu Sāti, son of a fisherman, does when he misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"No, venerable sir. For in many discourses the Blessed One has stated consciousness to be dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no origination of consciousness."</p>

<p>"Good, bhikkhus. It is good that you understand the Dhamma taught by me thus. For in many ways I have stated consciousness to be dependently arisen, since without a condition there is no origination of consciousness. But this bhikkhu Sāti, son of a fisherman, misrepresents us by his wrong grasp and injures himself and stores up much demerit; for this will lead to the harm and suffering of this misguided man for a long time.</p>

<h2><span class="add">Conditionality of Consciousness</span></h2>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Bhikkhus, consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent upon which it arises. When consciousness arises dependent on the eye and forms, it is reckoned as eye-consciousness; when consciousness arises dependent on the ear and sounds, it is reckoned as ear-consciousness; when consciousness arises dependent on the nose and odours, it is reckoned as nose-consciousness; when consciousness arises dependent on the tongue and flavours, it is reckoned as tongue-consciousness; when consciousness arises dependent on the body and tangibles, it is reckoned as body-consciousness; when consciousness arises dependent on the mind and mind-objects, it is reckoned as mind-consciousness.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Just as fire is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it burns — when fire burns dependent on logs, it is reckoned as a log fire; when fire burns dependent on faggots, it is reckoned as a faggot fire; when fire burns dependent on grass, it is reckoned as a grass fire; when fire burns dependent on cowdung, it is reckoned as a cowdung fire; when fire burns dependent on chaff, it is reckoned as a chaff fire; when fire burns dependent on rubbish, it is reckoned as a rubbish fire — so too, consciousness is reckoned by the particular condition dependent on which it arises.<span class="note" id="n404"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.404] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> The purpose of the simile is to show that there is no transmigration of consciousness across the sense doors. Just as a log fire burns in dependence on logs and ceases when its fuel is finished, without transmigrating to faggots and becoming reckoned as a faggot fire, so too, consciousness arisen in the eye door dependent on the eye and forms ceases when its conditions are removed, without transmigrating to the ear, etc., and becoming reckoned as ear-consciousness, etc. Thus the Buddha says in effect: "In the occurrence of consciousness there is not even the mere transmigration from door to door, so how can this misguided Sāti speak of transmigration from existence to existence?"</span></span></span> When consciousness arises dependent on the eye and forms, it is reckoned as eye-consciousness … when consciousness arises dependent on the mind and mind-objects, it is reckoned as mind-consciousness.</p>

<h3><span class="add">General Questionnaire on Being</span></h3>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Bhikkhus, do you see: ‘This has come to be’?"<span class="note" id="n405"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.405] <i>Bhūtam idan ti.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> "This" refers to the five aggregates. Having shown the conditionality of consciousness, the Buddha states this passage to show the conditionality of all the five aggregates, which come into being through conditions, their "nutriment," and pass out of being with the ceasing of those conditions. In the following <i>tadāhārasambhavaṁ,</i> MA takes the tad as a nominative representing the subject <i>(= taṁ khandhapañcakaṁ)</i>, but it seems more likely that it qualifies āhāra and that both should be taken as ablatives, the subject īdaṁ being understood. This interpretation seems confirmed by the third statement, <i>tadāhāranirodhā yaṁ bhūtaṁ taṁ nirodhadhammaṁ.</i> Horner's "This is the origination of nutriment" is clearly wrong.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Nutriment and Dependent Origination</span></h3>

<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>"Bhikkhus, there are these four kinds of nutriment for the maintenance of beings that already have come to be and for the support of those about to come to be. What four? They are: physical food as nutriment, gross or subtle; contact as the second; mental volition as the third; and consciousness as the fourth.<span class="note" id="n407"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.407] On the four nutriments, see <a href="mn9.html#n120">n.120</a>. MA: The Buddha states this passage and the following one linking up the nutriments with dependent origination in order to show that he knows not merely the five aggregates but the entire chain of conditions responsible for their being.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>"Now, bhikkhus, these four kinds of nutriment have what as their source, what as their origin, from what are they born and produced? These four kinds of nutriment have craving as their source, craving as their origin; they are born and produced from craving.</p>

<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>And this craving has what as its source … ? Craving has feeling as its source …</p>

<hr>
<p id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>And this feeling has what as its source … ? Feeling has contact as its source …</p>

<p id="p45"><span class="parno">45</span>And this contact has what as its source … ? Contact has the sixfold base as its source …</p>

<hr>
<p id="p46"><span class="parno">46</span>And this sixfold base has what as its source … ? The sixfold base has mentality-materiality as its source …</p>

<p id="p47"><span class="parno">47</span>And this mentality-materiality has what as its source … ? Mentality-materiality has consciousness as its source …</p>

<p id="p48"><span class="parno">48</span>And this consciousness has what as its source … ? Consciousness has formations as its source …</p>

<p id="p49"><span class="parno">49</span>And these formations have what as their source, what as their origin, from what are they born and produced? Formations have ignorance as their source, ignorance as their origin; they are born and produced from ignorance.</p>

<h3><span class="add">Forward Exposition on Arising</span></h3>

<p id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>"So, bhikkhus, with ignorance as condition, formations <span class="add">come to be</span>; with formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, mentality-materiality; with mentality-materiality as condition, the sixfold base; with the sixfold base as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, being; with being as condition, birth; with birth as condition, ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair come to be. Such is the origin of this whole mass of suffering.</p>

<h3><span class="add">Reverse Order Questionnaire on Arising</span></h3>

<h3><span class="add">The Round of Existence: Conception to Maturity</span></h3>

<p id="p92"><span class="parno">92</span>"Bhikkhus, the descent of the embryo takes place through the union of three things.<span class="note" id="n410"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.410] The following portion of the discourse may be understood as a concrete application of dependent origination — so far expressed only as a doctrinal formula — to the course of individual existence. The passage ¶¶92–93 may be taken to show the factors from consciousness through feeling that result from past ignorance and formations, ¶109 the causal factors of craving and clinging as they build up a continuation of the saṁsāric round. The following section, connecting dependent origination to the appearance of the Buddha and his teaching of the Dhamma, shows the practice of the Dhamma to be the means of bringing the round to an end.</span></span></span> Here, there is the union of the mother and father, but the mother is not in season, and the gandhabba<span class="note" id="n411"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.411] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> The <i>gandhabba</i> is the being arriving there. It is not someone (i.e., a disembodied spirit) standing nearby watching the future parents having intercourse, but a being driven on by the mechanism of kamma, due to be reborn on that occasion.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">The exact import of the word <i>gandhabba</i> in relation to the rebirth process is not explained in the Nikāyas, and the word in this sense occurs only here and at <a href="mn93.html#p21">93.18</a>. <a href="../dn/dn15.html">DN&nbsp;15</a>/ii.63 speaks of consciousness as "descending into the mother's womb," this being a condition for rebirth to take place. Thus we might identify the gandhabba here as the stream of consciousness, conceived more animistically as coming over from the previous existence and bringing along its total accumulation of kammic tendencies and personality traits. The fullest study of the concept of the gandhabba is Wijesekera, "Vedic Gandharva and Pali Gandhabba," in <i>Buddhist and Vedic Studies,</i> pp. 191–202.</span></span></span> is not present — in this case no descent of an embryo takes place. Here, there is the union of the mother and father, and the mother is in season, but the gandhabba is not present — in this case too no descent of the embryo takes place. But when there is the union of the mother and father, and the mother is in season, and the gandhabba is present, through the union of these three things the descent of the embryo takes place.</p>

<p>"The mother then carries the embryo in her womb for nine or ten months with much anxiety, as a heavy burden. Then, at the end of nine or ten months, the mother gives birth with much anxiety, as a heavy burden. Then, when the child is born, she nourishes it with her own blood; for the mother's breast-milk is called blood in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

<p>"When he grows up and his faculties mature, the child plays at such games as toy ploughs, tipcat, somersaults, toy windmills, toy measures, toy cars, and a toy bow and arrow.</p>

<p id="p93"><span class="parno">93</span>"When he grows up and his faculties mature <span class="add">still further</span>, the youth enjoys himself provided and endowed with the five cords of sensual pleasure, with forms cognizable by the eye … sounds cognizable by the ear … odours cognizable by the nose … flavours cognizable by the tongue … tangibles cognizable by the body that are wished for, desired, agreeable and likeable, connected with sensual desire, and provocative of lust.</p>

Engaged as he is in favouring and opposing, whatever feeling he feels — whether pleasant or painful or neither-painful-nor-pleasant — he delights in that feeling, welcomes it, and remains holding to it.<span class="note" id="n412"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.412] MA explains that he delights in the painful feeling by clinging to it with thoughts of "I" and "mine."

Now delight in feelings is clinging. With his clinging as condition, being <span class="add">comes to be</span>; with being as condition, birth; with birth as condition, ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair come to be.

<h3><span class="add">The Ending of the Round: The Gradual Training</span></h3>

<p id="p95"><span class="parno">95</span>"Here, bhikkhus, a Tathāgata appears in the world, accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed. He declares this world with its gods, its Māras, and its Brahmās, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, which he has himself realised with direct knowledge. He teaches the Dhamma good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, with the right meaning and phrasing, and he reveals a holy life that is utterly perfect and pure.</p>

<p>"A householder or householder's son or one born in some other clan hears that Dhamma. On hearing the Dhamma he acquires faith in the Tathāgata. Possessing that faith, he considers thus: ‘Household life is crowded and dusty; life gone forth is wide open. It is not easy, while living in a home, to lead the holy life utterly perfect and pure as a polished shell. Suppose I shave off my hair and beard, put on the yellow robe, and go forth from the home life into homelessness.’ On a later occasion, abandoning a small or a large fortune, abandoning a small or a large circle of relatives, he shaves off his hair and beard, puts on the yellow robe, and goes forth from the home life into homelessness.</p>

<p id="p101"><span class="parno">101</span>Abandoning harsh speech, he abstains from harsh speech; he speaks such words as are gentle, pleasing to the ear, and loveable, as go to the heart, are courteous, desired by many and agreeable to many.</p>

He abstains from accepting goats and sheep. He abstains from accepting fowl and pigs. He abstains from accepting elephants, cattle, horses, and mares. He abstains from accepting fields and land. He abstains from going on errands and running messages. He abstains from buying and selling. He abstains from false weights, false metals, and false measures.

Just as a bird, wherever it goes, flies with its wings as its only burden, so too the bhikkhu becomes content with robes to protect his body and with almsfood to maintain his stomach, and wherever he goes, he sets out taking only these with him.

<p>	"On returning from his almsround, after his meal he sits down, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness before him.

<p id="p108"><span class="parno">108</span>"Having thus abandoned these five hindrances, imperfections of the mind that weaken wisdom, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, he enters upon and abides in the first jhāna … With the stilling of applied and sustained thought, he enters upon and abides in the second jhāna … With the fading away as well of rapture … he enters upon and abides in the third jhāna … With the abandoning of pleasure and pain … he enters upon and abides in the fourth jhāna … which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity.</p>
