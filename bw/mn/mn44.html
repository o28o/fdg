<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was staying near Rājagaha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground.</p>

<p>Then the layman Visākha went to see the nun Dhammadinnā, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to her:</p>

<hr>

<p>“Ma’am, they speak of this thing called ‘identity’. What is this identity that the Buddha spoke of?”</p>

<p>“Visākha, the Buddha said that these five grasping aggregates are identity. That is: form, feeling, perception, choices, and consciousness. The Buddha said that these five grasping aggregates are identity.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Saying “Good, ma’am,” Visākha approved and agreed with what Dhammadinnā said. Then he asked another question:</p>

<p>“Ma’am, they speak of this thing called ‘the origin of identity’. What is the origin of identity that the Buddha spoke of?”</p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s the craving that leads to future rebirth, mixed up with relishing and greed, taking pleasure in various different realms. That is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving to continue existence, and craving to end existence. The Buddha said that this is the origin of identity.”</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>“Ma’am, they speak of this thing called ‘the cessation of identity’. What is the cessation of identity that the Buddha spoke of?”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>“It’s the fading away and cessation of that very same craving with nothing left over; giving it away, letting it go, releasing it, and not adhering to it. The Buddha said that this is the cessation of identity.”</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>“Ma’am, they speak of the practice that leads to the cessation of identity. What is the practice that leads to the cessation of identity that the Buddha spoke of?”</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>“The practice that leads to the cessation of identity that the Buddha spoke of is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.”</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>“But ma’am, is that grasping the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates? Or is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another?”</p>

<p>“That grasping is not the exact same thing as the five grasping aggregates. Nor is grasping one thing and the five grasping aggregates another. The desire and greed for the five grasping aggregates is the grasping there.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>“But ma’am, how does identity view come about?”</p>

<p>“It’s when an uneducated ordinary person has not seen the noble ones, and is neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve not seen good persons, and are neither skilled nor trained in the teaching of the good persons. They regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how identity view comes about.”</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>“But ma’am, how does identity view not come about?”</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>“It’s when an educated noble disciple has seen the noble ones, and is skilled and trained in the teaching of the noble ones. They’ve seen good persons, and are skilled and trained in the teaching of the good persons. They don’t regard form as self, self as having form, form in self, or self in form. They don’t regard feeling … perception … choices … consciousness as self, self as having consciousness, consciousness in self, or self in consciousness. That’s how identity view does not come about.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>“But ma’am, what is the noble eightfold path?”</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>“It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.”</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>“But ma’am, is the noble eightfold path conditioned or unconditioned?”</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>“The noble eightfold path is conditioned.”</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>“Are the three practice categories included in the noble eightfold path? Or is the noble eightfold path included in the three practice categories?”</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>“The three practice categories are not included in the noble eightfold path. Rather, the noble eightfold path is included in the three practice categories. Right speech, right action, and right livelihood: these things are included in the category of ethics. Right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion: these things are included in the category of immersion. Right view and right thought: these things are included in the category of wisdom.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>“But ma’am, what is immersion? What things are the foundations of immersion? What things are the prerequisites for immersion? What is the development of immersion?”</p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>“Unification of the mind is immersion. The four kinds of mindfulness meditation are the foundations of immersion. The four right efforts are the prerequisites for immersion. The cultivation, development, and making much of these very same things is the development of immersion.”</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>“How many processes are there?”</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>“There are these three processes. Physical, verbal, and mental processes.”</p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>“But ma’am, what is the physical process? What’s the verbal process? What’s the mental process?”</p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>“Breathing is a physical process. Placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental processes.”</p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>“But ma’am, why is breathing a physical process? Why are placing the mind and keeping it connected verbal processes? Why are perception and feeling mental processes?”</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>“Breathing is physical. It’s tied up with the body, that’s why breathing is a physical process. First you place the mind and keep it connected, then you break into speech. That’s why placing the mind and keeping it connected are verbal processes. Perception and feeling are mental. They’re tied up with the mind, that’s why perception and feeling are mental processes.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>“But ma’am, how does someone attain the cessation of perception and feeling?”</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>“A mendicant who is entering such an attainment does not think: ‘I will enter the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am entering the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have entered the cessation of perception and feeling.’ Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.”</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>“But ma’am, which cease first for a mendicant who is entering the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?”</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>“Verbal processes cease first, then physical, then mental.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>“But ma’am, how does someone emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling?”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>“A mendicant who is emerging from such an attainment does not think: ‘I will emerge from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I am emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling’ or ‘I have emerged from the cessation of perception and feeling.’ Rather, their mind has been previously developed so as to lead to such a state.”</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>“But ma’am, which arise first for a mendicant who is emerging from the cessation of perception and feeling: physical, verbal, or mental processes?”</p>

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>“Mental processes arise first, then physical, then verbal.”</p>

<hr>

<p><p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>“But ma’am, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact do they experience?”</p>

<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>“They experience three kinds of contact: emptiness, signless, and undirected contacts.”</p>

<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>“But ma’am, when a mendicant has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, what does their mind slant, slope, and incline to?”</p>

<p id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>“Their mind slants, slopes, and inclines to seclusion.”</p>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>“But ma’am, how many feelings are there?”</p>

<p id="p38"><span class="parno">38</span>“There are three feelings: pleasant, painful, and neutral feeling.”</p>

<p id="p93"><span class="parno">39</span>“What are these three feelings?”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p40"><span class="parno">40</span>“Anything felt physically or mentally as pleasant or enjoyable. This is pleasant feeling. Anything felt physically or mentally as painful or unpleasant. This is painful feeling. Anything felt physically or mentally as neither pleasurable nor painful. This is neutral feeling.”</p>

<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>“What is pleasant and what is painful in each of the three feelings?”</p>

<p id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>“Pleasant feeling is pleasant when it remains and painful when it perishes. Painful feeling is painful when it remains and pleasant when it perishes. Neutral feeling is pleasant when there is knowledge, and painful when there is ignorance.”</p>

<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>“What underlying tendencies underlie each of the three feelings?”</p>

<p id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>“The underlying tendency for greed underlies pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency for repulsion underlies painful feeling. The underlying tendency for ignorance underlies neutral feeling.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p45"><span class="parno">45</span>“Do these underlying tendencies always underlie these feelings?”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p46"><span class="parno">46</span>“No, they do not.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p47"><span class="parno">47</span>“What should be given up in regard to each of these three feelings?”</p>

<p id="p48"><span class="parno">48</span>“The underlying tendency to greed should be given up when it comes to pleasant feeling. The underlying tendency to repulsion should be given up when it comes to painful feeling. The underlying tendency to ignorance should be given up when it comes to neutral feeling.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p49"><span class="parno">49</span>“Should these underlying tendencies be given up regarding all instances of these feelings?”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>“No, not in all instances. </p>

<hr>

<p>Take a mendicant who, quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters and remains in the first absorption, which has the rapture and bliss born of seclusion, while placing the mind and keeping it connected. With this they give up greed, and the underlying tendency to greed does not lie within that. </p>

<p>And take a mendicant who reflects: ‘Oh, when will I enter and remain in the same dimension that the noble ones enter and remain in today?’ Nursing such a longing for the supreme liberations gives rise to sadness due to longing. </p>

<p>With this they give up repulsion, and the underlying tendency to repulsion does not lie within that. </p>

<p>Take a mendicant who, giving up pleasure and pain, and ending former happiness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth absorption, without pleasure or pain, with pure equanimity and mindfulness. With this they give up ignorance, and the underlying tendency to ignorance does not lie within that.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p51"><span class="parno">51</span>“But ma’am, what is the counterpart of pleasant feeling?”</p>

<p id="p52"><span class="parno">52</span>“Painful feeling.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p53"><span class="parno">53</span>“What is the counterpart of painful feeling?”</p>

<p id="p54"><span class="parno">54</span>“Pleasant feeling.”</p>

<p id="p55"><span class="parno">55</span>“What is the counterpart of neutral feeling?”</p>

<p id="p56"><span class="parno">56</span>“Ignorance.”</p>

<p id="p57"><span class="parno">57</span>“What is the counterpart of ignorance?”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p58"><span class="parno">58</span>“Knowledge.”</p>

<p id="p59"><span class="parno">59</span>“What is the counterpart of knowledge?”</p>

<p id="p60"><span class="parno">60</span>“Freedom.”</p>

<p id="p61"><span class="parno">61</span>“What is the counterpart of freedom?”</p>

<p id="p62"><span class="parno">62</span>“Extinguishment.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p63"><span class="parno">63</span>“What is the counterpart of extinguishment?”</p>

<hr>

<p>“Your question goes too far, Visākha. You couldn’t figure out the limit of questions. For extinguishment is the culmination, destination, and end of the spiritual life. If you wish, go to the Buddha and ask him this question. You should remember it in line with his answer.”</p>

<p id="p64"><span class="parno">64</span>And then the layman Visākha approved and agreed with what the nun Dhammadinnā said. He got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled her, keeping her on his right. Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and informed the Buddha of all they had discussed.</p>

<p>When he had spoken, the Buddha said to him: </p>

<hr>

<p>“The nun Dhammadinnā is astute, Visākha, she has great wisdom. If you came to me and asked this question, I would answer it in exactly the same way as the nun Dhammadinnā. That is what it means, and that’s how you should remember it.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p65"><span class="parno">65</span>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the layman Visākha was happy with what the Buddha said.</p>
