<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary. Then the lay follower Visākha went to the bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā,<span class="note" id="n459"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.459] Visākha was a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha and a non-returner. Dhammadinnā, his former wife in lay life, had attained arahantship soon after her ordination as a bhikkhunī. She was declared by the Buddha the foremost bhikkhunī disciple in expounding the Dhamma.</span></span></span> and after paying homage to her, he sat down at one side and asked her:</p>

<hr>
<p>"Lady, ‘identity, identity’ is said. What is called identity by the Blessed One?"</p>

<p>"Friend Visākha, these five aggregates affected by clinging are called identity by the Blessed One; that is, the material form aggregate affected by clinging, the feeling aggregate affected by clinging, the perception aggregate affected by clinging, the formations aggregate affected by clinging, and the consciousness aggregate affected by clinging. These five aggregates affected by clinging are called identity by the Blessed One."<span class="note" id="n460"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.460] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains the compound <i>pañc’upādānakkhandhā</i> as the five aggregates that become the condition for clinging (MṬ: as its objects). Since these five aggregates are, in brief, the entire noble truth of suffering (<a href="mn9.html#p7">MN&nbsp;9.15</a>; <a href="mn28.html#p3">28.3</a>), it will be seen that the first four questions pose an inquiry into the Four Noble Truths expressed in terms of personal identity rather than suffering.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Saying, "Good, lady," the lay follower Visākha delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā's words. Then he asked her a further question:</p>

<p>"Lady, ‘origin of identity, origin of identity’ is said. What is called the origin of identity by the Blessed One?"</p>

<p>"Friend Visākha, it is craving, which brings renewal of being, is accompanied by delight and lust, and delights in this and that; that is, craving for sensual pleasures, craving for being, and craving for non-being. This is called the origin of identity by the Blessed One."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Lady, ‘cessation of identity, cessation of identity’ is said. What is called the cessation of identity by the Blessed One?"</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Friend Visākha, it is the remainderless fading away and ceasing, the giving up, relinquishing, letting go, and rejecting of that same craving. This is called the cessation of identity by the Blessed One."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Lady, ‘the way leading to the cessation of identity, the way leading to the cessation of identity’ is said. What is called the way leading to the cessation of identity by the Blessed One?"</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Friend Visākha, it is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration."</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Lady, is that clinging the same as these five aggregates affected by clinging, or is the clinging something apart from the five aggregates affected by clinging?"</p>

<p>"Friend Visākha, that clinging is neither the same as these five aggregates affected by clinging nor is clinging something apart from the five aggregates affected by clinging. It is the desire and lust in regard to the five aggregates affected by clinging that is the clinging there."<span class="note" id="n461"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.461] MA: Because clinging is only one part of the aggregate of formations (as defined here, greed), it is not the same as the five aggregates; and because clinging cannot be altogether disconnected from the aggregates, there is no clinging apart from the aggregates.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Identity View</span></h3>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"Lady, how does identity view come to be?"</p>

<p>"Here, friend Visākha, an untaught ordinary person, who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards material form as self, or self as possessed of material form, or material form as in self, or self as in material form. He regards feeling as self, or self as possessed of feeling, or feeling as in self, or self as in feeling. He regards perception as self, or self as possessed of perception, or perception as in self, or self as in perception. He regards formations as self, or self as possessed of formations, or formations as in self, or self as in formations. He regards consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how identity view comes to be."<span class="note" id="n462"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.462] These are the twenty kinds of identity view. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> quotes Pṭs i.144–45 to illustrate the four basic modes of identity view in regard to material form. One may regard material form as self, in the way the flame of a burning oil-lamp is identical with the colour (of the flame). Or one may regard self as possessing material form, as a tree possesses a shadow; or one may regard material form as in self, as the scent is in the flower; or one may regard self as in material form, as a jewel is in a casket.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Lady, how does identity view not come to be?"</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Here, friend Visākha, a well-taught noble disciple, who has regard for noble ones and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, who has regard for true men and is skilled and disciplined in their Dhamma, does not regard material form as self, or self as possessed of material form, or material form as in self, or self as in material form. He does not regard feeling as self, or self as possessed of feeling, or feeling as in self, or self as in feeling. He does not regard perception as self, or self as possessed of perception, or perception as in self, or self as in perception. He does not regard formations as self, or self as possessed of formations, or formations as in self, or self as in formations. He does not regard consciousness as self, or self as possessed of consciousness, or consciousness as in self, or self as in consciousness. That is how identity view does not come to be."</p>

<h3><span class="add">The Noble Eightfold Path</span></h3>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Lady, what is the Noble Eightfold Path?"</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Friend Visākha, it is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration."</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"Lady, is the Noble Eightfold Path conditioned or unconditioned?"</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"Friend Visākha, the Noble Eightfold Path is conditioned."</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"Lady, are the three aggregates included by the Noble Eightfold Path, or is the Noble Eightfold Path included by the three aggregates?"<span class="note" id="n463"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.463] The word <i>khandha</i> here has a different meaning than in the more common context of the five aggregates affected by clinging. It here refers to a body of training principles, the three divisions of the Noble Eightfold Path into virtue <i>(sīla)</i>, concentration <i>(samādhi)</i>, and wisdom <i>(paññā)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"The three aggregates are not included by the Noble Eightfold Path, friend Visākha, but the Noble Eightfold Path is included by the three aggregates. Right speech, right action, and right livelihood — these states are included in the aggregate of virtue. Right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration — these states are included in the aggregate of concentration. Right view and right intention — these states are included in the aggregate of wisdom."</p>

<h3><span class="add">Concentration</span></h3>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"Lady, what is concentration? What is the basis of concentration? What is the equipment of concentration? What is the development of concentration?"</p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"Unification of mind, friend Visākha, is concentration; the four foundations of mindfulness are the basis of concentration; the four right kinds of striving are the equipment of concentration; the repetition, development, and cultivation of these same states is the development of concentration therein."<span class="note" id="n464"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.464] The four foundations of mindfulness are the basis of concentration <i>(samādhinimitta)</i> in the sense of being its condition (<a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>). Here it would seem incorrect to translate <i>nimitta</i> as "sign," in the sense of either distinctive mark or object. The four right kinds of striving are explained at <a href="mn77.html#p30">MN&nbsp;77.16</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Formations</span></h3>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"Lady, how many formations are there?"</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"There are these three formations, friend Visākha: the bodily formation, the verbal formation, and the mental formation."</p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"But, lady, what is the bodily formation? What is the verbal formation? What is the mental formation?"</p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>"In-breathing and out-breathing, friend Visākha, are the bodily formation; applied thought and sustained thought are the verbal formation; perception and feeling are the mental formation."<span class="note" id="n465"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.465] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> Dhammadinnā anticipated Visākha's intention to ask about the formations that cease when one enters the attainment of cessation. Thus she explained the three formations in this way rather than as wholesome and unwholesome volitions of body, speech, and mind, the meaning relevant within the context of dependent origination.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="23"><span class="parno">23</span>"But, lady, why are in-breathing and out-breathing the bodily formation? Why are applied thought and sustained thought the verbal formation? Why are perception and feeling the mental formation?"</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>"Friend Visākha, in-breathing and out-breathing are bodily, these are states bound up with the body; that is why in-breathing and out-breathing are the bodily formation. First one applies thought and sustains thought, and subsequently one breaks out into speech; that is why applied thought and sustained thought are the verbal formation. Perception and feeling are mental, these are states bound up with the mind; that is why perception and feeling are the mental formation."<span class="note" id="n466"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.466] MA explains further that the bodily formation and the mental formation are said to be formations "bound up" with the body and the mind in the sense that they are formed by the body and by the mind, while the verbal formation is a formation in the sense that it forms speech. The verb form <i>vitakketvā vicāretvā</i> has been rendered in a way that maintains consistency with the rendering of the nouns <i>vitakka</i> and <i>vicāra</i> as "applied thought" and "sustained thought."</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">The Attainment of Cessation</span></h3>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>"Lady, how does the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling come to be?"</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>"Friend Visākha, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling, it does not occur to him: ‘I shall attain the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I am attaining the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I have attained the cessation of perception and feeling’; but rather his mind has previously been developed in such a way that it leads him to that state."<span class="note" id="n467"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.467] Cessation can be attained only by a non-returner or an arahant with mastery over the eight jhānic attainments. The meditator enters each attainment in turn, emerges from it, and contemplates it with insight as impermanent, suffering, and not self. After completing this procedure through the base of nothingness, he attends to certain preliminary duties, and then determines to be without mind for a particular length of time. He then briefly enters the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception, after which mind and mental functions utterly cease. Thus his determination, backed by his previous accomplishments and preparations, leads him into the attainment of cessation. See Vsm XXIII, 32–43.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>"Lady, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling, which states cease first in him: the bodily formation, the verbal formation, or the mental formation?"</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>"Friend Visākha, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling, first the verbal formation ceases, then the bodily formation, then the mental formation."<span class="note" id="n468"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.468] Applied and sustained thought cease first in the second jhāna; in-and-out breathing cease next in the fourth jhāna; and perception and feeling cease last in the attainment of cessation itself.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>"Lady, how does emergence from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling come to be?"</p>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>"Friend Visākha, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, it does not occur to him: ‘I shall emerge from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I am emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I have emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling’; but rather his mind has previously been developed in such a way that it leads him to that state."<span class="note" id="n469"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.469] When the time decided upon by the determination for the attainment has lapsed, by reason of that prior determination the meditator spontaneously emerges from the attainment of cessation and the mind-process resumes.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>"Lady, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, which states arise first in him: the bodily formation, the verbal formation, or the mental formation?"</p>

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>"Friend Visākha, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, first the mental formation arises, then the bodily formation, then the verbal formation."<span class="note" id="n470"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.470] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: When one emerges from cessation, the consciousness of fruition attainment arises first, and the perception and feeling associated with that are the mental formation that arises first. Then, with the subsequent descent into the life continuum, the bodily formation, i.e., breathing, recommences. And subsequently, when the meditator resumes his ordinary activity, the verbal formation arises.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>"Lady, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact touch him?"</p>

<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>"Friend Visākha, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, three kinds of contact touch him: voidness contact, signless contact, desireless contact."<span class="note" id="n471"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.471] The first state of consciousness to arise on emerging from cessation is that of fruition attainment, which is called voidness, the signless, and the desireless because of its own inherent quality and because of its object, Nibbāna. Here these three names for fruition are assigned to the contact associated with fruition.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>"Lady, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, to what does his mind incline, to what does it lean, to what does it tend?"</p>

<p id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>"Friend Visākha, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, his mind inclines to seclusion, leans to seclusion, tends to seclusion."<span class="note" id="n472"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.472] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MṬ:</a> Nibbāna, the object of the fruition consciousness that arises on emerging from cessation, is called seclusion <i>(viveka)</i> because it is secluded from all conditioned things.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">Feeling</span></h3>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>"Lady, how many kinds of feeling are there?"</p>

<p id="p38"><span class="parno">38</span>"Friend Visākha, there are three kinds of feeling: pleasant feeling, painful feeling, and neither-painful-nor-pleasant feeling."</p>

<p id="p39"><span class="parno">39</span>"But, lady, what is pleasant feeling? What is painful feeling? What is neither painful-nor-pleasant feeling?"</p>

<p id="p40"><span class="parno">40</span>"Friend Visākha, whatever is felt bodily or mentally as pleasant and soothing is pleasant feeling.

<h3><span class="add">Conclusion</span></h3>

<p id="p64"><span class="parno">64</span>Then the lay follower Visākha, having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to her, keeping her on his right, he went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and told the Blessed One his entire conversation with the bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā. When he finished speaking, the Blessed One told him:</p>

<p>"The bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā is wise, Visākha, the bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā has great wisdom. If you had asked me the meaning of this, I would have explained it to you in the same way that the bhikkhunī Dhammadinnā has explained it. Such is its meaning, and so you should remember it."<span class="note" id="n480"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.480] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: By saying this, the Buddha makes this sutta Word of the Conqueror, stamped as it were with the seal of the Conqueror.</span></span></span></p>
