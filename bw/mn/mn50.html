<section class="raw_sutta">

<div lang="en">
<p><span class="parno">1</span><span>So I have heard. </span>At one time Venerable Mahāmoggallāna was staying in the land of the Bhaggas on Crocodile Hill, in the deer park at Bhesakaḷā’s Wood.</p>
<p>At that time Moggallāna was walking meditation in the open air.</p>

<hr>

<p><p>Now at that time Māra the Wicked had got inside Moggallāna’s belly. Moggallāna thought: “Why now is my belly so very heavy, like I’ve just eaten a load of beans?” Then he stepped down from the walking path, entered his dwelling, sat down on the seat spread out, and investigated inside himself.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>He saw that Māra the Wicked had got inside his belly. So he said to Māra: “Come out, Wicked One, come out! Do not harass the Realized One or his disciple. Don’t create lasting harm and suffering for yourself!”</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>Then Māra thought: “This ascetic doesn’t really know me or see me when he tells me to come out. Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly, so how could a disciple?”</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>Then Moggallāna said to Māra: “I know you even when you’re like this, Wicked One. Do not think, ‘He doesn’t know me.’ You are Māra the Wicked. And you think, ‘This ascetic doesn’t really know me or see me when he tells me to come out. Not even the Teacher could recognize me so quickly, so how could a disciple?’”</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>Then Māra thought: “This ascetic really does know me and see me when he tells me to come out.”</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>Then Māra came up out of Moggallāna’s mouth and stood against the door bar. Moggallāna saw him there and said: “I see you even there, Wicked One. Do not think, ‘He doesn’t see me.’ That’s you, Wicked One, standing against the door bar.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, Wicked One, I was a Māra named Dūsī, and I had a sister named Kāḷī. You were her son, which made you my nephew.</p>

<p>At that time Kakusandha, the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha arose in the world. Kakusandha had a fine pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva. Of all the disciples of the Buddha Kakusandha, none were the equal of Venerable Vidhura in teaching Dhamma. And that’s how he came to be known as Vidhura.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>But when Venerable Sañjīva had gone to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, he easily attained the cessation of perception and feeling. Once upon a time, Sañjīva was sitting at the root of a certain tree having attained the cessation of perception and feeling. Some cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him sitting there and said, ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! This ascetic passed away while sitting. We should cremate him.’ They collected grass, wood, and cow-dung, heaped it all on Sañjīva’s body, set it on fire, and left.</p>

<p>Then, when the night had passed, Sañjīva emerged from that attainment, shook out his robes, and, since it was morning, he put on his outer robe and entered the village for alms. Those cowherds, shepherds, farmers, and passers-by saw him wandering for alms and said, ‘It’s incredible, it’s amazing! This ascetic passed away while sitting, and now he has come back to life!’ And that’s how he came to be known as Sañjīva.</p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>Then it occurred to Māra Dūsī, ‘I don’t know the course of rebirth of these ethical mendicants of good character. Why don’t I take possession of these brahmins and householders and say: “Come, all of you, abuse, attack, harass, and trouble the ethical mendicants of good character. Hopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability.”’ And that’s exactly what he did.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>Then those brahmins and householders abused, attacked, harassed, and troubled the ethical mendicants of good character: ‘These shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman, say, ‘We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!’ And they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate. They’re just like an owl on a branch, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse. They’re just like a jackal on a river-bank, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a fish. They’re just like a cat by an alley or a drain or a dustbin, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates as it hunts a mouse. They’re just like an unladen donkey by an alley or a drain or a dustbin, which meditates and concentrates and contemplates and ruminates. In the same way, these shavelings, fake ascetics, riffraff, black spawn from the feet of our Kinsman, say, ‘We practice absorption meditation! We practice absorption meditation!’ And they meditate and concentrate and contemplate and ruminate.’</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>Most of the people who died at that time — when their body broke up, after death — were reborn in a place of loss, a bad place, the underworld, hell.</p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>Then Kakusandha the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, addressed the mendicants: ‘Mendicants, the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra Dūsī. He told them to abuse you in the hope of upsetting your minds so that he can find a vulnerability. Come, all of you mendicants, meditate spreading a heart full of love to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of love to the whole world — abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will. Meditate spreading a heart full of compassion … Meditate spreading a heart full of rejoicing … Meditate spreading a heart full of equanimity to one direction, and to the second, and to the third, and to the fourth. In the same way above, below, across, everywhere, all around, spread a heart full of equanimity to the whole world — abundant, expansive, limitless, free of enmity and ill will.’</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>When those mendicants were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way, they went to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, where they meditated spreading a heart full of love … compassion … rejoicing … equanimity.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>Then it occurred to Māra Dūsī, ‘Even when I do this I don’t know the course of rebirth of these ethical mendicants of good character. Why don’t I take possession of these brahmins and householders and say: “Come, all of you, honor, respect, esteem, and venerate the ethical mendicants of good character. Hopefully by doing this we can upset their minds so that Māra Dūsī can find a vulnerability.”’</p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>And that’s exactly what he did. Then those brahmins and householders honored, respected, esteemed, and venerated the ethical mendicants of good character.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>Most of the people who died at that time — when their body broke up, after death — were reborn in a good place, a heavenly realm.</p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>Then Kakusandha the Blessed One, the perfected one, the fully awakened Buddha, addressed the mendicants: ‘Mendicants, the brahmins and householders have been possessed by Māra Dūsī. He told them to venerate you in the hope of upsetting your minds so that he can find a vulnerability. Come, all you mendicants, meditate observing the ugliness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world, and observing the impermanence of all conditions.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>When those mendicants were instructed and advised by the Buddha Kakusandha in this way, they went to a wilderness, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty hut, where they meditated observing the ugliness of the body, perceiving the repulsiveness of food, perceiving dissatisfaction with the whole world, and observing the impermanence of all conditions.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>Then the Buddha Kakusandha put on his outer robe in the morning and, taking this bowl and robe, entered the village for alms with Venerable Vidhura as his second monk.</p>

<p>Then Māra Dūsī took possession of a certain boy, picked up a rock, and hit Vidhura on the head, cracking it open. Then Vidhura, with blood pouring from his cracked skull, still followed behind the Buddha Kakusandha. Then the Buddha Kakusandha turned his whole body, the way that elephants do, to look back, saying, ‘This Māra Dūsī knows no bounds.’ And with that look Māra Dūsī fell from that place and was reborn in the Great Hell.</p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>Now that Great Hell is known by three names: ‘The Six Fields of Contact’ and also ‘The Impaling With Spikes’ and also ‘Individually Painful’. Then the wardens of hell came to me and said, ‘When stake meets stake in your heart, you will know that you’ve been roasting in hell for a thousand years.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>I roasted for many years, many centuries, many millennia in that Great Hell. For ten thousand years I roasted in the annex of that Great Hell, experiencing the pain called ‘coming out’. My body was in human form, but I had the head of a fish.</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">21</span>What kind of hell was that, 
	<br>where Dūsī was roasted 
	<br>after attacking the disciple Vidhura 
	<br>along with the brahmin Kakusandha?</p>


<p class="verse"><span class="parno">22</span>There were 100 iron spikes, 
	<br>each one individually painful. 
	<br>That’s the kind of hell 
	<br>where Dūsī was roasted 
	<br>after attacking the disciple Vidhura 
	<br>along with the brahmin Kakusandha.</p>


<p class="verse"><span class="parno">23</span>Dark One, if you attack 
	<br>a mendicant who directly knows this, 
	<br>a disciple of the Buddha, 
	<br>you’ll fall into suffering.</p>


<p class="verse"><span class="parno">24</span>There are mansions that last for an eon 
	<br>standing in the middle of a lake. 
	<br>Sapphire-colored, brilliant, 
	<br>they sparkle and shine. 
	<br>Dancing there are nymphs

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">26</span>I’m the one who, encouraged by the Buddha,

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">30</span>I’m the one who asked Sakka 
	<br>in the Palace of Victory: 
	<br>‘Vāsava, do you know the freedom

	<br>And I’m the one to whom Sakka

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">32</span>I’m the one who asked Brahmā

	<br>Or do you see the radiance

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">33</span>And I’m the one to whom Brahmā 
	<br>truthfully admitted his progress:

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">34</span>I see the radiance 
	<br>transcending the Brahmā realm. 
	<br>So how could I say today

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">35</span>Dark One, if you attack

	<br>you’ll fall into suffering.</p>


<p class="verse"><span class="parno">36</span>I’m the one who has touched the peak of Mount Meru

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">37</span>Dark One, if you attack

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">39</span>In the same way, Māra, 
	<br>in attacking the Realized One, 
	<br>you’ll only burn yourself, 
	<br>like a fool touching the flames.</p>


<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">40</span>Māra’s done a bad thing
