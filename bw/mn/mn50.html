<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the venerable Mahā Moggallāna was living in the Bhagga country at Suṁsumāragira in the Bhesakaḷā Grove, the Deer Park.</p>

<p>Now on that occasion the venerable Mahā Moggallāna was walking up and down in the open. And on that occasion Māra the Evil One went into the venerable Mahā Moggallāna's belly and entered his bowels. Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna considered thus: "Why is my belly so heavy? One would think it full of beans." Thus he left the walk and went into his dwelling, where he sat down on a seat made ready.</p>

<hr>
<p>When he had sat down, he gave thorough attention to himself</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>He saw that Māra the Evil One had gone into his belly and had entered his bowels. When he saw this, he said: "Come out, Evil One! Come out, Evil One! Do not harass the Tathāgata, do not harass the Tathāgata's disciple, or it will lead to your harm and suffering for a long time."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then Māra the Evil One thought: "This recluse does not know me, he does not see me when he says that. Even his teacher would not know me so soon, so how can this disciple know me?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the venerable Mahā Moggallāna said: "Even thus I know you, Evil One. Do not think: ‘He does not know me.’ You are Māra, Evil One. You were thinking thus, Evil One: ‘This recluse does not know me, he does not see me when he says that. Even his teacher would not know me so soon, so how can this disciple know me?’"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then Māra the Evil One thought: "The recluse knew me, he saw me when he said that," whereupon he came up from the venerable Mahā Moggallāna's mouth and stood against the door bar.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>The venerable Mahā Moggallāna saw him standing there and said: "I see you there too, Evil One. Do not think: ‘He does not see me.’ You are standing against the door bar, Evil One.</p>

<hr>
<p>"It happened once, Evil One, that I was a Māra named Dūsī,<span class="note" id="n517"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.517] The name means "the Corrupter" or "the Corrupted One." In the Buddhist conception of the universe the position of Māra, like that of Mahā Brahmā, is a fixed one that is assumed by different individuals in accordance with their kamma.</span></span></span> and I had a sister named Kālī. You were her son, so you were my nephew.</p>

<p>"Now on that occasion the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, had appeared in the world.<span class="note" id="n518"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.518] Kakusandha was the first Buddha to arise in this present cosmological cycle called the "Auspicious Age." He was followed by the Buddhas Konāgamaṇa and Kassapa, after whom the present Buddha Gotama arose.</span></span></span> The Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, had an auspicious pair of chief disciples named Vidhura and Sañjīva. Among all the disciples of the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, there was none equal to the venerable Vidhura in teaching the Dhamma. That was how the venerable Vidhura came to have the designation ‘Vidhura.’<span class="note" id="n519"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.519] The name means "the Unrivalled."</span></span></span> But the venerable Sañjīva, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, entered without difficulty upon the cessation of perception and feeling.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"It happened once, Evil One, that the venerable Sañjīva had seated himself at the root of a certain tree and entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling. Some cowherds, shepherds, ploughmen, and travellers saw the venerable Sañjīva sitting at the root of the tree having entered upon the cessation of perception and feeling, and they thought: ‘It is wonderful, sirs, it is marvellous! This recluse died while sitting. Let us cremate him.’ Then the cowherds, shepherds, ploughmen, and travellers collected grass, wood, and cowdung, and having piled it up against the venerable Sañjīva's body, they set fire to it and went on their way.</p>

<p>"Now, Evil One, when the night had ended, the venerable Sañjīva emerged from the attainment.<span class="note" id="n520"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.520] One who has attained to cessation, it seems, is not subject to injury or death within the attainment itself. At Vsm XXIII, 37 it is said that the attainment protects even his belongings such as his robes and seat from destruction.</span></span></span> He shook his robe, and then, it being morning, he dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went into the village for alms. The cowherds, shepherds, ploughmen, and travellers saw the venerable Sañjīva wandering for alms, and they thought: ‘It is wonderful, sirs, it is marvellous! This recluse who died while sitting has come back to life!’ That was how the venerable Sañjīva came to have the designation ‘Sañjīva.’<span class="note" id="n521"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.521] The name means "the Survivor."</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"Then, Evil One, the Māra Dūsī considered thus: ‘There are these virtuous bhikkhus of good character, but I do not know their coming or their going. Let me now take possession of the brahmin householders, telling them: "Come now, abuse, revile, scold, and harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when they are abused, reviled, scolded, and harassed by you, some change will come about in their minds whereby the Māra Dūsī may find an opportunity."’<span class="note" id="n522"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.522] That is, by causing defilements to arise in their minds, he will prevent them from escaping from saṁsāra.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Then, Evil One, the Māra Dūsī took possession of those brahmin householders, telling them: ‘Come now, abuse, revile, scold, and harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when they are abused, reviled, scolded, and harassed by you, some change will come about in their minds whereby the Māra Dūsī may find an opportunity.’ Then, when the Māra Dūsī had taken possession of the brahmin householders, they abused, reviled, scolded, and harassed the virtuous bhikkhus of good character thus:<span class="note" id="n523"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.523] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> takes pains to point out that Māra did not exercise control over their actions, in which case he alone would have been responsible and the brahmins could not have generated bad kamma by their deeds. Rather, Māra caused the brahmins to imagine scenes of the bhikkhus engaged in improper conduct, and this aroused their antagonism and induced them to harass the bhikkhus. Māra's intent in doing so was to make the bhikkhus give rise to anger and dejection.</span></span></span> ‘These bald-pated recluses, these swarthy menial offspring of the Kinsman's feet,<span class="note" id="n524"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.524] "The Kinsman" <i>(bandhu)</i> is Brahmā, who was called thus by the brahmins because they regarded him as their primal ancestor. MA explains that it was a belief among the brahmins that they themselves were the offspring of Brahmā's mouth, the <i>khattiyas</i> of his breast, the <i>vessas</i> of his belly, the <i>suddas</i> of his legs, and <i>samaṇas</i> of the soles of his feet.</span></span></span> claim: "We are meditators, we are meditators!" and with shoulders drooping, heads down and all limp, they meditate, premeditate, out-meditate, and mismeditate.<span class="note" id="n525"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.525] <i>Jhāyanti pajjhāyanti nijjhāyanti apajjhāyanti.</i> Though the verbs individually do not have an established pejorative sense, the string is obviously intended as a denigration.

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>Now, Evil One, on that occasion most of those human beings, when they died, reappeared on the dissolution of the body, after death, in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Then the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, addressed the bhikkhus thus: ‘Bhikkhus, the Māra Dūsī has taken possession of the brahmin householders, telling them: "Come now, abuse, revile, scold, and harass the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when they are abused, reviled, scolded, and harassed by you, some change will come about in their mind whereby the Māra Dūsī may find an opportunity." Come, bhikkhus, abide pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to yourselves, abide pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with loving-kindness, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will. Abide pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with compassion … with a mind imbued with altruistic joy … with a mind imbued with equanimity … abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility and without ill will.’<span class="note" id="n526"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.526] The four <i>brahmavihāras</i> are the appropriate antidote for the hostility of others, as well as for the tendencies to anger and dejection in one's own mind.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"So, Evil One, when those bhikkhus had been thus advised and instructed by the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, then, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, they abided pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with loving-kindness … with a mind imbued with compassion … with a mind imbued with appreciative joy … with a mind imbued with equanimity … without hostility and without ill will.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"Then, Evil One, the Māra Dūsī considered thus: ‘Though I do as I am doing, still I do not know the coming or the going of these virtuous bhikkhus of good character. Let me now take possession of the brahmin householders, telling them: "Come now, honour, respect, revere, and venerate the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when they are honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by you, some change will come about in their minds whereby the Māra Dūsī may find an opportunity."’<span class="note" id="n527"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.527] This time Māra's intent was to cause the bhikkhus to fall victim to pride, complacency, and negligence.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"Then, Evil One, the Māra Dūsī took possession of those brahmin householders, telling them: ‘Come now, honour, respect, revere, and venerate the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when they are honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by you, some change will come about in their minds whereby the Māra Dūsī may find an opportunity.’ Then, when the Māra Dūsī had taken possession of the brahmin householders, they honoured, respected, revered, and venerated the virtuous bhikkhus of good character.</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Now, Evil One, on that occasion most of those human beings, when they died, reappeared on the dissolution of the body, after death, in a happy destination, even the heavenly world.</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"Then, Evil One, the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, addressed the bhikkhus thus: ‘Bhikkhus, the Māra Dūsī has taken possession of those brahmin householders, telling them: "Come now, honour, respect, revere, and venerate the virtuous bhikkhus of good character; then perhaps, when they are honoured, respected, revered, and venerated by you, some change will come about in their minds whereby the Māra Dūsī may find an opportunity." Come, bhikkhus, abide contemplating foulness in the body, perceiving repulsiveness in nutriment, perceiving disenchantment with all the world, contemplating impermanence in all formations.’<span class="note" id="n528"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.528] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> quotes a sutta (<a href="../an/an7.46.html">AN&nbsp;7:46</a>/iv.46–53) stating that these four meditations are the antidotes, respectively, for sexual desire, craving for tastes, attraction to the world, and infatuation with gain, honour, and praise.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"So, Evil One, when those bhikkhus had been thus advised and instructed by the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, then, gone to the forest or to the root of a tree or to an empty hut, they abided contemplating foulness in the body, perceiving repulsiveness in nutriment, perceiving disenchantment with all the world, contemplating impermanence in all formations.</p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went into the village for alms with the venerable Vidhura as his attendant.</p>

<p>"Then the Māra Dūsī took possession of a certain boy, and picking up a stone, he struck the venerable Vidhura on the head with it and cut his head. With blood running from his cut head, the venerable Vidhura followed close behind the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened. Then the Blessed One Kakusandha, accomplished and fully enlightened, turned around and looked at him with the elephant look: ‘This Māra Dūsī knows no bounds.’ And with that look, Evil One, the Māra Dūsī fell from that place and reappeared in the Great Hell.<span class="note" id="n529"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.529] MA: The elephant look <i>(nāgapalokita)</i> means that without twisting his neck, he turns his whole body in order to look. The Māra Dūsī did not die because of the Buddha’s elephant look, but because the evil kamma he generated in wronging a great disciple cut off his life right on the spot.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"Now, Evil One, there are three names for the Great Hell: the hell of the six bases for contact, the hell of the impalement with stakes, and the hell to be felt for oneself.<span class="note" id="n530"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.530] The Great Hell, also called Avīci, is described in greater detail in <a href="mn130.html#p23a">MN&nbsp;130.16–19</a>.</span></span></span> Then, Evil One, the wardens of hell came up to me and said: ‘Good sir, when stake meets stake in your heart, then you will know: "I have been roasting in hell for a thousand years."’</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"For many a year, Evil One, for many a century, for many a millennium, I roasted in that Great Hell.
