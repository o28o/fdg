<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Nāḷandā in Pāvārika's Mango Grove.</p>

<p>Now on that occasion the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta was staying at Nāḷandā with a large assembly of Nigaṇṭhas.</p>

<p>Then, when the Nigaṇṭha <span class="add">named</span> Dīgha Tapassī <span class="note" id="n578"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.578] This means “Tall Ascetic,” a name given to him because of his height.</span></span></span> had wandered for alms in Nāḷandā and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to Pāvārika's Mango Grove to see the Blessed One. He exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he stood at one side. As he stood there, the Blessed One said to him: "There are seats, Tapassī, sit down if you like."</p>

<p>When this was said, Dīgha Tapassī took a low seat and sat down at one side. Then the Blessed One asked him: "Tapassī, how many kinds of action does the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action?"</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Friend Gotama, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta is not accustomed to use the description ‘action, action’; the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta is accustomed to use the description ‘rod, rod.’"<span class="note" id="n579"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.579] <i>Daṇḍa,</i> originally a stick or staff, acquires the meaning of rod as an instrument of punishment, and subsequently comes to mean punishment or infliction itself, even without reference to an instrument. Its use here suggests that the Jains regarded bodily, verbal, and mental activity as instruments by which the individual torments himself by prolonging his bondage in saṁsāra and torments others by causing them harm.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Then, Tapassī, how many kinds of rod does the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action?"</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Friend Gotama, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describes three kinds of rod for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action; that is, the bodily rod, the verbal rod, and the mental rod."<span class="note" id="580"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.580] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> The Nigaṇṭhas held that the first two “rods” create kamma independently of the involvement of the mind <i>(acittaka)</i> just as, when the wind blows, the branches sway and the leaves rustle without any initiative of mind.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"How then, Tapassī, is the bodily rod one, the verbal rod another, and the mental rod still another?"</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"The bodily rod is one, friend Gotama, the verbal rod is another, and the mental rod is still another."</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Of these three kinds of rod, Tapassī, thus analysed and distinguished, which kind of rod does the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe as the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action: the bodily rod or the verbal rod or the mental rod?"</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"Of these three kinds of rod, friend Gotama, thus analysed and distinguished, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describes the bodily rod as the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rod."</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Do you say the bodily rod, Tapassī?"</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"I say the bodily rod, friend Gotama."</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Thus the Blessed One made the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī maintain his statement up to the third time.</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>Then the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī asked the Blessed One: "And you, friend Gotama, how many kinds of rod do you describe for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action?"</p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>"Of these three kinds of action, Tapassī, thus analysed and distinguished, I describe mental action as the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action, and not so much bodily action and verbal action."<span class="note" id="n581"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.581] The Buddha may have said this because in his teaching volition <i>(cetanā),</i> a mental factor, is the essential ingredient of kamma, and in its absence—that is, in the case of unintentional bodily or verbal activity—no kamma is created. <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA,</a> however, maintains that the Buddha said this referring to wrong view with fixed consequences <i>(niyatā micchā diṭṭhi),</i> and it quotes in support <a href=".../an/an1.18.html#p3">AN&nbsp;1:18.3</a>/i.33: “Bhikkhus, I see nothing so blameworthy as wrong view. Wrong view is the most blameworthy of all things.” These types of wrong view are described at <a href="mn60.html#p4">MN&nbsp;60.5</a>, 13 and 21.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>"Do you say mental action, friend Gotama?"</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>"I say mental action, Tapassī."</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>"Do you say mental action, friend Gotama?"</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>"I say mental action, Tapassī."</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>"Do you say mental action, friend Gotama?"</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>"I say mental action, Tapassī."</p>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>Thus the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī made the Blessed One maintain his statement up to the third time, after which he rose from his seat and went to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta.</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>Now on that occasion the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta was seated together with a large assembly of laymen from Bālaka headed by Upāli. The Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta saw the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī coming in the distance and asked him: "Now where are you coming from in the middle of the day, Tapassī?"</p>

<p>"I am coming from the presence of the recluse Gotama, venerable sir."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Did you have some conversation with the recluse Gotama, Tapassī?"</p>

<p>"I had some conversation with the recluse Gotama, venerable sir."</p>

<p>"What was your conversation with him like, Tapassī?"</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī related to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta his entire conversation with the Blessed One.</p>

<p>When this was said, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta told him: "Good, good, Tapassī! The Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī has answered the recluse Gotama like a well-taught disciple who understands his teacher's dispensation rightly. What does the trivial mental rod count for in comparison with the gross bodily rod? On the contrary, the bodily rod is the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rod."</p>

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>When this was said, the householder Upāli said to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta: "Good, good, venerable sir, <span class="add">on the part of</span> Dīgha Tapassī! The venerable Tapassī has answered the recluse Gotama like a well-taught disciple who understands his teacher's dispensation rightly. What does the trivial mental rod count for in comparison with the gross bodily rod? On the contrary, the bodily rod is the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rod. Now, venerable sir, I shall go and refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine on the basis of this statement. If the recluse Gotama maintains before me what the venerable Dīgha Tapassī made him maintain, then just as a strong man<span class="note" id="n582"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.582] As at <a href="mn35.html#p3">MN&nbsp;35.5</a>.</span></span></span> might seize a long-haired ram by the hair and drag him to and drag him fro and drag him round about, so in debate I will drag the recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag him round about. Just as a strong brewer's workman might throw a big brewer's sieve into a deep water tank, and taking it by the corners, might drag it to and drag it fro and drag it round about, so in debate I will drag the recluse Gotama to and drag him fro and drag him round about. Just as a strong brewer's mixer might take a strainer by the corners and shake it down and shake it up and thump it about, so in debate I will shake the recluse Gotama down and shake him up and thump him about. And just as a sixty-year-old elephant might plunge into a deep pond and enjoy playing the game of hemp-washing, so I shall enjoy playing the game of hemp-washing with the recluse Gotama . Venerable sir, I shall go and refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine on the basis of this statement."</p>

<p>"Go, householder, and refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine on the basis of this statement. For either I should refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine or else the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī or you yourself."</p>

<hr>
<p id="33"><span class="parno">33</span>When this was said, the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī said to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta: "Venerable sir, I do not agree that the householder Upāli should <span class="add">try to</span> refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine. For the recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting magic by which he converts disciples of other sectarians."</p>

<p>"It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that the householder Upāli should go over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama; but it is possible, it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to discipleship under the householder Upāli. Go, householder, and refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine. For either I should refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine or else the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī or you yourself."</p>

<p>For the second time … For the third time, the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī said to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta: "Venerable sir, I do not agree that the householder Upāli should <span class="add">try to</span> refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine. For the recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting magic by which he converts disciples of other sectarians."</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," the householder Upāli replied, and he rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta, keeping him on his right, he left to go to the Blessed One in Pāvārika's Mango Grove. There, after paying homage to the Blessed One, he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, did the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī come here?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>"The Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī came here, householder."</p>

<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>"Venerable sir, did you have some conversation with him?"</p>

<p id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>"I had some conversation with him, householder."</p>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>"What was your conversation with him like, venerable sir?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p38"><span class="parno">38</span>Then the Blessed One related to the householder Upāli his entire conversation with the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī.</p>

<p id="p39"><span class="parno">39</span>When this was said, the householder Upāli said to the Blessed One: "Good, good, venerable sir, on the part of Tapassī! The Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī has answered the Blessed One like a well-taught disciple who understands his teacher's dispensation rightly. What does the trivial mental rod count for in comparison with the gross bodily rod? On the contrary, the bodily rod is the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rod."</p>

<p>"Householder, if you will debate on the basis of truth, we might have some conversation about this."</p>

<p>"I will debate on the basis of truth, venerable sir, so let us have some conversation about this."</p>

<p id="p40"><span class="parno">40</span>"What do you think, householder? Here some Nigaṇṭha might be afflicted, suffering, and gravely ill <span class="add">with an illness needing treatment by cold water, which his vows prohibit</span> and he might refuse cold water <span class="add">though mentally longing for it</span> and use only <span class="add">the permissible</span> hot water <span class="add">thus keeping his vows bodily and verbally</span>. Because he does not get cold water he might die. Now, householder, where would the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta describe his rebirth <span class="add">as taking place</span>?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>"Venerable sir, there are gods called ‘mind-bound’; he would be reborn there.</p>

<p id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>Why is that?</p>

<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>Because when he died he was still bound <span class="add">by attachment</span> in the mind."<span class="note" id="n583"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.583] The parenthetical additions in the previous paragraph, inserted by Ñm, are supplied from <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA.</a> Ñm, in Ms, sums up the argument thus: The Nigaṇ̣ṭhas are not allowed to use cold water (because they regard it as containing living beings). By his bodily and verbal refusal of cold water he has kept his bodily and verbal conduct pure, but if he longs in his mind for cold water his mental conduct is impure, and thus he is reborn among the “mind-bound gods” <i>(manosattā devā).</i></span></span></span></p>

<p id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>"Householder, householder, pay attention how you reply! What you said afterwards does not agree with what you said before, nor does what you said before agree with what you said afterwards. Yet you made this statement: ‘I will debate on the basis of truth, venerable sir, so let us have some conversation about this.’"</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, although the Blessed One has spoken thus, yet the bodily rod is the most reprehensible for the performance of evil action, for the perpetration of evil action, and not so much the verbal rod and the mental rod."<span class="note" id="n584"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.584] At ¶64 Upāli admits that at this point he had already acquired confidence in the Buddha.

<p id="p68"><span class="parno">68</span>Then the Blessed One gave the householder Upāli progressive instruction, that is, talk on giving, talk on virtue, talk on the heavens; he explained the danger, degradation, and defilement in sensual pleasures and the blessing of renunciation. When he knew that the householder Upāli's mind was ready, receptive, free from hindrances, elated, and confident, he expounded to him the teaching special to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. Just as a clean cloth with all marks removed would take dye evenly, so too, while the householder Upāli sat there, the spotless immaculate vision of the Dhamma arose in him: "All that is subject to arising is subject to cessation."<span class="note" id="n588"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.588] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> Vision of the Dhamma <i>(dhammacakkhu)</i> is the path of stream-entry.

<p>"You may go, householder, at your own convenience."</p>

<p id="p69"><span class="parno">69</span>Then the householder Upāli, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on his right, he left to return to his own house. There he addressed the doorkeeper thus: "Good doorkeeper, from today on I close my door to the Nigaṇṭhas and the Nigaṇṭhīs, and I open my door to the Blessed One's bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, men lay followers, and women lay followers.

<p id="p71"><span class="parno">71</span>Then the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī went to the householder Upāli's house.

He has closed his door to the Nigaṇṭhas and Nigaṇṭhīs, and he has opened it to the Blessed One's bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, men lay followers, and women lay followers. Venerable sir, if you need alms, wait here; they will bring it to you here."</p>

<p>"I do not need alms, friend," he said, and he turned back and went to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and told him: "Venerable sir, it is only too true that the householder Upāli has gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama. Venerable sir, I did not get your consent when I told you: ‘Venerable sir, I do not agree that the householder Upāli should <span class="add">try to</span> refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine. For the recluse Gotama is a magician and knows a converting magic by which he converts disciples of knows a converting magic by which he converts disciples of other sectarians.’ And now, venerable sir, your householder Upāli has been converted by the recluse Gotama with his converting magic!"</p>

<hr>
<p>"It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen that the householder Upāli should go over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama; but it is possible, it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to discipleship under the householder Upāli."</p>

<p>A second time … And a third time the Nigaṇṭha Dīgha Tapassī told the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta: "Venerable sir, it is only too true that the householder Upāli has gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama … with his converting magic!"</p>

<p>"It is impossible, Tapassī, it cannot happen … it can happen that the recluse Gotama might come over to discipleship under the householder Upāli. Now I shall go myself and find out whether or not he has gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama."</p>

<p id="p72"><span class="parno">72</span>Then the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta went with a large assembly of Nigaṇṭhas to the householder Upāli's house. The doorkeeper saw him coming in the distance and told him: "Wait, venerable sir, do not enter. From today on the householder Upāli has gone over to discipleship under the recluse Gotama. He has closed his door to the Nigaṇṭhas and Nigaṇṭhīs, and he has opened his door to the Blessed One's bhikkhus, bhikkhunīs, men lay followers, and women lay followers.

<p>"Good doorkeeper, go to the householder Upāli and tell him: ‘Venerable sir, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta is standing at the outer gate with a large assembly of Nigaṇṭhas; he wishes to see you.’"</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," he replied, and he went to the householder Upāli and told him: "Venerable sir, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta is standing at the outer gate with a large assembly of Nigaṇṭhas; he wishes to see you."</p>

<p>"In that case, good doorkeeper, make seats ready in the hall of the central door."</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," he replied, and after he had made seats ready in the hall of the central door, he returned to the householder Upāli and told him: "Venerable sir, the seats are made ready in the hall of the central door. You may come at your own convenience."</p>

<p id="p73"><span class="parno">73</span>Then the householder Upāli went to the hall of the central door and sat down on the highest, best, chief, most excellent seat there. Then he told the doorkeeper: "Now, good doorkeeper, go to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and tell him: ‘Venerable sir, the householder Upāli says: "Enter, venerable sir, if you wish."’"</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," he replied, and he went to the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta and told him: "Venerable sir, the householder Upāli says: ‘Enter, venerable sir, if you wish.’"</p>

<hr>
<p>Then the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta went with the large assembly of Nigaṇṭhas to the hall of the central door.</p>

<hr>
<p>Previously, when the householder Upāli saw the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta coming in the distance, he used to go out to meet him, dust off the highest, best, chief, most excellent seat there with an upper robe, and having arranged it all around, have him seated on it. But now, while seated himself on the highest, best, chief, most excellent seat, he told Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta: "Venerable sir, there are seats; sit down if you wish."</p>

<p>When this was said, the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta said: "Householder, you are mad, you are an imbecile. You went saying: ‘Venerable sir, I shall refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine,’ and you have come back caught by the vast net of his doctrine. Just as if a man went to castrate someone and came back castrated himself, just as if a man went to put out someone's eyes and came back with his own eyes put out; so you too, householder, went saying: ‘Venerable sir, I shall refute the recluse Gotama's doctrine,’ and you have come back caught by the vast net of his doctrine.

<p id="74"><span class="parno">74</span>"Auspicious is that converting magic, venerable sir, good is that converting magic!<span class="note" id="n590"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.590] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> Upāli says this referring to the path of stream-entry he had penetrated earlier.</span></span></span> Venerable sir, if my beloved kinsmen and relatives were to be converted by this conversion, it would lead to the welfare and happiness of my beloved kinsmen and relatives for a long time. If all nobles were to be converted by this conversion, it would lead to the welfare and happiness of the nobles for a long time. If all brahmins … all merchants … all workers were to be converted by this conversion, it would lead to the welfare and happiness of the workers for a long time. If the world with its gods, its Māras, and its Brahmās, this generation with its recluses and brahmins, its princes and its people, were to be converted by this conversion, it would lead to the welfare and happiness of the world for a long time. As to this, venerable sir, I shall give you a simile; for some wise men here understand the meaning of a statement by a simile.</p>

<p id="p75"><span class="parno">75</span>"Venerable sir, there was once a brahmin who was old, aged, and burdened with years, and he had as a wife a young brahmin girl who was pregnant and near her confinement. Then she told him: ‘Go, brahmin, buy a young monkey in the market and bring it back to me as a playmate for my child.’ He replied: ‘Wait, madam, till you have borne the child. If you bear a boy, then I will go to the market and buy a young male monkey and bring it back to you as a playmate for your little boy; but if you bear a girl, then I will go to the market and buy a young female monkey and bring it back to you as a playmate for your little girl.’ For the second time she made the same request and received the same answer. For the third time she made the same request.</p>

<p id="p76"><span class="parno">76</span>Then, since his mind was bound to her with love, he went to the market, bought a young male monkey, brought it back, and told her: ‘I have bought this young male monkey in the market and brought it back to you as a playmate for your child.’ Then she told him: ‘Go, brahmin, take this young male monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer's son and tell him: "Good Rattapāṇi, I want this young male monkey dyed the colour called yellow-unguent, pounded and re-pounded, and smoothened out on both sides."’</p>

<p id="p77"><span class="parno">77</span>Then, since his mind was bound to her with love, he took the young male monkey to Rattapāṇi the dyer's son and told him: ‘Good Rattapāṇi, I want this young male monkey dyed the colour called yellow-unguent, pounded and re-pounded, and smoothened out on both sides.’ Rattapāṇi the dyer's son told him: ‘Venerable sir, this young male monkey will take a dyeing but not a pounding or a smoothening out.’ So too, venerable sir, the doctrine of the foolish Nigaṇṭhas will give delight to fools but not to the wise, and it will not withstand testing or being smoothened out.</p>

<p id="p78"><span class="parno">78</span>"Then, venerable sir, on another occasion that brahmin took a pair of new garments to Rattapāṇi the dyer's son and told him: ‘Good Rattapāṇi, I want this pair of new garments dyed the colour called yellow-unguent, pounded and re-pounded, and smoothened out on both sides.’ Rattapāṇi the dyer's son told him:</p>

<p> ‘Venerable sir, this pair of new garments will take a dyeing and a pounding and a smoothening out.’ So too, venerable sir, the doctrine of that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, will give delight to the wise but not to fools, and it will withstand testing and being smoothened out."</p>

<p id="p79"><span class="parno">79</span>"Householder, the assembly and the king know you thus: ‘The householder Upāli is a disciple of the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta.’ Whose disciple should we consider you to be?"</p>

<p>When this was said, the householder Upāli rose from his seat, and arranging his upper robe on one shoulder, he extended his hands in reverential salutation in the direction of the Blessed One and told the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta:</p>
