<section class="raw_sutta">  <!-- English and Pali -->
<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." — "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, dwell possessed of virtue, possessed of the Pāṭimokkha, restrained with the restraint of the Pāṭimokkha, perfect in conduct and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, train by undertaking the training precepts.<span class="note" id="n76"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.76] MA says that the expression <i>sampannasīlā,</i> translated here as "possessed of virtue," can mean either "perfect in virtue" <i>(paripuṇṇasīlā)</i> or "endowed with virtue" <i>(sīlasamaṅgino)</i>. The Pāṭimokkha is the code of monastic discipline, which in its Pali version consists of 227 rules. "Resort" <i>(gocara)</i> implies a proper resort for alms, though it may also signify the proper deportment of a monk, his serene and self-possessed bearing. The key terms in this passage are analysed at Vsm I, 43–52.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I be dear and agreeable to my companions in the holy life, respected and esteemed by them,’ let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.<span class="note" id="n77"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.77] MA: The passage beginning with "let him fulfil the precepts," repeated for each of the following sections until the end of the sutta, comprises the entire threefold training. The phrase about fulfilling the precepts signifies the training in higher virtue <i>(adhisīlasikkhā)</i>; the phrase "be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation" indicates the training in concentration or the higher mind <i>(adhicittasikkhā)</i>; and the phrase "be possessed of insight" points to the training in the higher wisdom <i>(adhipaññāsikkhā)</i>. The phrase "dwell in empty huts" combines the latter two trainings, since one resorts to an empty hut to develop serenity and insight.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I be one to obtain robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites,’ let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May the services of those whose robes, almsfood, resting place, and medicinal requisites I use bring them great fruit and benefit,’ let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘When my kinsmen and relatives who have passed away and died remember me with confidence in their minds, may that bring them great fruit and great benefit,<span class="note" id="n78"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.78] That is, if the relatives who have been reborn in the realm of ghosts or in some lower deva realm recollect virtuous bhikkhus with confidence, that confidence will become a source of merit for them, protecting them from bad rebirths and becoming a positive condition for the attainment of Nibbāna.</span></span></span> ’ let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I become one to obtain at will, without trouble or difficulty, the four jhānas that constitute the higher mind and provide a pleasant abiding here and now,’ let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I contact with the body and abide in those liberations that are peaceful and immaterial, transcending forms,’ let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.<span class="note" id="n79"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.79] These are the four immaterial attainments for which the full formulas are to be found below at <a href="mn8.html#p7">MN&nbsp;8.8–11</a>, <a href="mn25.html#p22">MN&nbsp;25.16–19</a>, etc. MA glosses "body" as "mental body" <i>(nāmakāya)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I, with the destruction of the five lower fetters, become due to reappear spontaneously <span class="add">in the Pure Abodes</span> and there attain final Nibbāna, without ever returning from that world,’<span class="note" id="n81"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.81] In addition to the first three fetters, the non-returner destroys the other two "lower fetters" of sensual desire and ill will.

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish:<span class="note" id="n82"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.82] ¶¶12–17 present the six kinds of direct knowledge <i>(abhiññā)</i>.

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and the human, those that are far as well as near,’ let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I understand the minds of other beings, of other persons, having encompassed them with my own mind. May I understand a mind affected by lust as affected by lust and a mind unaffected by lust as unaffected by lust; may I understand a mind affected by hate as affected by hate and a mind unaffected by hate as unaffected by hate; may I understand a mind affected by delusion as affected by delusion and a mind unaffected by delusion as unaffected by delusion; may I understand a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; may I understand an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; may I understand a surpassed mind as surpassed and an unsurpassed mind as unsurpassed; may I understand a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; may I understand a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated,’ let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I recollect my manifold past lives<span class="note" id="nx"><span class="details"><span class="p">Explained in detail at Vsm XIII, 13–71.</span></span></span>, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion: ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared here.’ Thus with their aspects and particulars may I recollect my manifold past lives,’ let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and reappearing<span class="note" id="ny"><span class="details"><span class="p">Explained in detail at Vsm XIII, 72–101.</span></span></span>, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate; may I understand how beings pass on according to their actions thus: ‘These worthy beings who were ill conducted in body, speech, and mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in hell; but these worthy beings who were well conducted in body, speech, and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in the heavenly world.’ Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, I saw beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and I understood how beings pass on according to their actions.’ let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"If a bhikkhu should wish: ‘May I, by realising for myself with direct knowledge, here and now enter upon and abide in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints,’<span class="note" id="n83"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.83] MA: In this passage "mind" and "wisdom" signify, respectively, the concentration and wisdom associated with the fruit of arahantship. Concentration is called "deliverance of mind" <i>(cetovimutti)</i> because it is liberated from lust; wisdom is called "deliverance by wisdom" <i>(paññāvimutti)</i> because it is liberated from ignorance. The former is normally the result of serenity, the latter the result of insight. But when they are coupled and described as taintless <i>(anāsava)</i>, they jointly result from the destruction of the taints by the supramundane path of arahantship.</span></span></span> let him fulfil the precepts, be devoted to internal serenity of mind, not neglect meditation, be possessed of insight, and dwell in empty huts.</p>

<p>"So it was with reference to this that it was said: ‘Bhikkhus, dwell possessed of virtue, possessed of the Pāṭimokkha, restrained with the restraint of the Pāṭimokkha, perfect in conduct and resort, and seeing fear in the slightest fault, train by undertaking the training precepts.’"</p>

<p>That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
