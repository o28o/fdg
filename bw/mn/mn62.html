<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">According to <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>, this discourse was taught to Rāhula when he was eighteen years old, for the purpose of dispelling desire connected with the household life. The Shorter Discourse of Advice to Rāhula is <a href="mn147.html">MN&nbsp;147</a>.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

<p>Then, when it was morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Sāvatthī for alms. The venerable Rāhula also dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, followed close behind the Blessed One.</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One looked back and addressed the venerable Rāhula thus:<span class="note" id="n641"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.641] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: While Rāhula was following the Buddha, he noted with admiration the physical perfection of the Master and reflected that he himself was of similar appearance, thinking: "I too am handsome like my father the Blessed One. The Buddha’s form is beautiful and so too is mine." The Buddha read Rāhula's thought and decided to admonish him at once, before such vain thoughts led him into greater difficulties. Hence the Buddha framed his advice in terms of contemplating the body as neither a self nor the possession of a self.</span></span></span> "Rāhula, any kind of material form whatever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all material form should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Only material form, Blessed One? Only material form, Sublime One?"</p>

<p>"Material form, Rāhula, and feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness."</p>

<p>Then the venerable Rāhula considered thus: "Who would go into the town for alms today when personally admonished by the Blessed One?" Thus he turned back and sat down at the root of a tree, folding his legs crosswise, setting his body erect, and establishing mindfulness in front of him.</p>

<p>The venerable Sāriputta saw him sitting there and addressed him thus: "Rāhula, develop mindfulness of breathing. When mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is of great fruit and great benefit."<span class="note" id="n642"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.642] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: Ven. Sāriputta, Rāhula's teacher, gave Rāhula this advice unaware that he had already been given different meditation instructions by the Buddha. He was misled by Rāhula's cross-legged posture into thinking that he was practising mindfulness of breathing.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then, when it was evening, the venerable Rāhula rose from meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to him, he sat down at one side and asked the Blessed One:</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, how is mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated, so that it is of great fruit and great benefit?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2a">“Rāhula,<span class="note" id="n643"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.643] MA: The Buddha here explains the meditation on the four great elements rather than mindfulness of breathing in order to dispel Rāhula’s attachment to the body, which had not yet been removed by the brief instruction on the egolessness of material form. See <a href="mn28.html#n329">n.329</a> for explanation of terms requiring comment.</span></span></span> whatever internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, and clung-to, that is, head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, diaphragm, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach, feces, or whatever else internally, belonging to oneself, is solid, solidified, and clung-to: this is called the internal earth element. Now both the internal earth element and the external earth element are simply earth element. And that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’
	
When one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom, one becomes disenchanted with the earth element and makes the mind dispassionate towards the earth element.</p>

Now both the internal air element and the external air element are simply air element.
