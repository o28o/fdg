<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus." — "Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, do you remember the five lower fetters as taught by me?"</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>When this was said, the venerable Mālunkyāputta replied: "Venerable sir, I remember the five lower fetters as taught by the Blessed One."<span class="note" id="n649"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.649] The five lower fetters <i>(orambhāgiyāni saṁyojanāni)</i> are so called because they lead to rebirth in the sense-sphere planes. They are eradicated in their entirety only by the non-returner.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"But, Mālunkyāputta, in what way do you remember the five lower fetters as taught by me?"</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, I remember identity view as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One. I remember doubt as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One. I remember adherence to rules and observances as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One. I remember sensual desire as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One. I remember ill will as a lower fetter taught by the Blessed One. It is in this way, venerable sir, that I remember the five lower fetters as taught by the Blessed One."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Mālunkyāputta, to whom do you remember my having taught these five lower fetters in that way?<span class="note" id="n650"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.650] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> The question may be raised: "When the Buddha had asked about the fetters and the Elder replied in terms of the fetters, why does the Buddha criticise his reply?" The reason is that Mālunkyāputta held the view that a person is fettered by the defilements only at times when they assail him, while at other times he is not fettered by them. The Buddha spoke as he did to show the error in this view.</span></span></span> Would not the wanderers of other sects confute you with the simile of the infant? For a young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion ‘identity,’ so how could identity view arise in him? Yet the underlying tendency to identity view lies within him.<span class="note" id="n651"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.651] <i>Anuseti tvev’assa sakkāyadiṭṭ̣hānusayo.</i> On the <i>anusayas</i> or underlying tendencies, see <a href="mn44.html#n473">n.473.</a> In the commentaries the defilements are distinguished as occurring at three levels: the <i>anusaya</i> level, where they remain as mere latent dispositions in the mind; the <i>pariyuṭṭ̣hāna</i> level, where they rise up to obsess and enslave the mind (referred to in ¶5 of this discourse); and the <i>vītikkama</i> level, where they motivate unwholesome bodily and verbal action. The point of the Buddha’s criticism is that the fetters, even when they do not come to active manifestation, continue to exist at the <i>anusaya</i> level so long as they have not been eradicated by the supramundane path.</span></span></span> A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion ‘teachings,’<span class="note" id="n652"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.652] <i>Dhammā.</i> This could also have been rendered "things."</span></span></span> so how could doubt about the teachings arise in him? Yet the underlying tendency to doubt lies within him. A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion ‘rules,’ so how could adherence to rules and observances arise in him? Yet the underlying tendency to adhere to rules and observances lies within him. A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion ‘sensual pleasures,’ so how could sensual desire arise in him? Yet the underlying tendency to sensual lust lies within him. A young tender infant lying prone does not even have the notion ‘beings,’ so how could ill will towards beings arise in him? Yet the underlying tendency to ill will lies within him. Would not the wanderers of other sects confute you with this simile of the infant?"</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Thereupon, the venerable Ānanda said: "It is the time, Blessed One, it is the time, Sublime One, for the Blessed One to teach the five lower fetters. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it."</p>

<p>"Then listen, Ānanda, and attend closely to what I shall say."</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," the venerable Ānanda replied.</p>

<p>The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p><span class="parno">5–9</span>"Here, Ānanda, an untaught ordinary person who has no regard for noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who has no regard for true men and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by identity view, and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from the arisen identity view; and when that identity view has become habitual and is uneradicated in him, it is a lower fetter. He abides with a mind obsessed and enslaved by doubt … by adherence to rules and observances … by sensual lust … by ill will, and he does not understand as it actually is the escape from arisen ill will; and when that ill will has become habitual and is uneradicated in him, it is a lower fetter.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"There is a path, Ānanda, a way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters; that anyone, without relying on that path, on that way, shall know or see or abandon the five lower fetters — this is not possible. Just as when there is a great tree standing possessed of heartwood, it is not possible that anyone shall cut out its heartwood without cutting through its bark and sapwood, so too, there is a path … this is not possible.</p>

<p>"Suppose, Ānanda, the river Ganges were full of water right up to the brim so that crows could drink from it, and then a feeble man came thinking: ‘By swimming across the stream with my arms, I shall get safely across to the further shore of this river Ganges’; yet he would not be able to get safely across. So too, when the Dhamma is being taught to someone for the cessation of personality, if his mind does not enter into it and acquire confidence, steadiness, and resolution, then he can be regarded as like the feeble man.</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"And what, Ānanda, is the path, the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters?

<p>"Whatever exists therein of material form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness, he sees those states as impermanent, as suffering, as a disease, as a tumour, as a barb, as a calamity, as an affliction, as alien, as disintegrating, as void, as not self.<span class="note" id="n655"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.655] This passage shows the development of insight <i>(vipassanā)</i> upon a basis of serenity <i>(samatha)</i>, using the jhāna on which the practice of insight is based as the object of insight contemplation.

<hr>
<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>"Venerable sir, if this is the path, the way to the abandoning of the five lower fetters, then how is it that some bhikkhus here <span class="add">are said to</span> gain deliverance of mind and some <span class="add">are said to</span> gain deliverance by wisdom?"</p>

<p>"The difference here, Ānanda, is in their faculties, I say."<span class="note" id="n659"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.659] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: Among those who proceed by way of serenity, one bhikkhu emphasises unification of mind — he is said to gain deliverance of mind; another emphasises wisdom — he is said to gain deliverance by wisdom. Among those who proceed by way of insight, one emphasises wisdom — he is said to gain deliverance by wisdom; another emphasises unification of mind — he is said to gain deliverance of mind. The two chief disciples attained arahantship by emphasising both serenity and insight, but Ven. Sāriputta became one who gained deliverance by wisdom and Ven. Mahā Moggallāna became one who gained deliverance of mind. Thus the reason (for the different designations) is the difference in their faculties, i.e., between the predominance of the concentration faculty and of the wisdom faculty.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>That is what the Blessed One said. The venerable Ānanda was satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
