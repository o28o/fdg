<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrels’ Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Now on that occasion a bhikkhu named Gulissāni, a forest-dweller of lax behaviour, had come on a visit to stay in the midst of the Saṅgha for some business or other. The venerable Sāriputta addressed the bhikkhus with reference to the bhikkhu Gulissāni thus:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Friends, when a forest-dwelling bhikkhu comes to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, he should be respectful and deferential towards his companions in the holy life. If he is disrespectful and undeferential towards his companions in the holy life, there will be those who would say of him: ‘What has this venerable forest-dweller gained by his dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, since he is disrespectful and undeferential towards his companions in the holy life?’ Since there would be those who would say this of him, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu who has come to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha should be respectful and deferential towards his companions in the holy life.</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">3–4</span>"When a forest-dwelling bhikkhu comes to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, he should be skilled in good behaviour regarding seats thus: ‘I shall sit down in such a way that I do not encroach upon elder bhikkhus and do not deny new bhikkhus a seat.’ If he is not skilled in good behaviour regarding seats, there will be those who would say of him: ‘What has this venerable forest-dweller gained by his dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, since he does not even know what pertains to good behaviour?’ Since there would be those who would say this of him, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu who has come to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha should be skilled in good behaviour regarding seats.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"When a forest-dwelling bhikkhu comes to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, he should not enter the village too early or return late in the day. If he enters the village too early and returns late in the day, there will be those who would say of him: ‘What has this venerable forest-dweller gained by his dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, since he enters the village too early and returns late in the day?’ Since there would be those who would say this of him, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu who has come to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha should not enter the village too early or return late in the day.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"When a forest-dwelling bhikkhu comes to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, he should not go before the meal or after the meal to visit families.<span class="note" id="n692"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.692] This is prohibited by <a href="../vi/bu-vb-pc46.html">Pāc&nbsp;46</a> (Vin iv.98–101). A bhikkhu may visit families at these times only if he has informed another bhikkhu in the monastery of his intentions, except during the season for making and giving robes.</span></span></span> If he goes before the meal or after the meal to visit families, there will be those who would say of him: ‘Surely this venerable forest-dweller, while dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, must be used to making untimely visits, since he behaves thus when he has come to the Saṅgha.’ Since there would be those who would say this of him, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu who has come to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha should not go before the meal or after the meal to visit families.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"When a forest-dwelling bhikkhu comes to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, he should not be haughty and personally vain. If he is haughty and personally vain, there will be those who would say of him: ‘Surely this venerable forest-dweller, while dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, must generally be haughty and personally vain, since he behaves thus when he has come to the Saṅgha.’ Since there would be those who would say this of him, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu who has come to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha should not be haughty and personally vain.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"When a forest-dwelling bhikkhu comes to the Saṅgha and is living in the Saṅgha, he should not be rough-tongued and loose-spoken.

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"A forest-dwelling bhikkhu should guard the doors of his sense faculties.

If he is not devoted to wakefulness, there will be those who would say of him: ‘What has this venerable forest-dweller gained by his dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, since he is not devoted to wakefulness?’ Since there would be those who would say this of him, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu should be devoted to wakefulness.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"A forest-dwelling bhikkhu should be energetic. If he is not energetic, there will be those who would say of him: ‘What has this venerable forest-dweller gained by his dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, since he is lazy?’ Since there would be those who would say this of him, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu should be energetic.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"A forest-dwelling bhikkhu should be established in mindfulness. If he is unmindful, there will be those who would say of him: ‘What has this venerable forest-dweller gained by his dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, since he is unmindful? ’ Since there would be those who would say this of him, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu should be established in mindfulness.</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"A forest-dwelling bhikkhu should be concentrated. If he is not concentrated, there will be those who would say of him: ‘What has this venerable forest-dweller gained by his dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, since he is not concentrated?’ Since there would be those who would say this of him, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu should be concentrated.</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"A forest-dwelling bhikkhu should be wise.

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"A forest-dwelling bhikkhu should apply himself to the higher Dhamma and the higher Discipline.<span class="note" id="n693"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.693] <i>Abhidhamma abhivinaya.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> says that he should apply himself to learning the text and commentary to the Abhidhamma Piṭaka and the Vinaya Piṭaka. This is clearly anachronistic. On Abhidhamma in the context of the suttas, see <a href="mn44.html#n362">n.362.</a> Although there is no corresponding body of literature called "Abhivinaya," it seems probable the word refers to a systematic and analytical approach to the study of the Vinaya, perhaps that embedded in the Suttavibhaṅga of the Vinaya Piṭaka.</span></span></span> There are those who ask a forest-dwelling bhikkhu a question about the higher Dhamma and the higher Discipline. If, when so asked, he fails to reply, there will be those who would say of him: ‘What has this venerable forest-dweller gained by his dwelling alone in the forest, doing as he likes, since when he is asked a question about the higher Dhamma and the higher Discipline he fails to reply?’ Since there will be those who would say this of him, a forest-dwelling bhikkhu should apply himself to the higher Dhamma and the higher Discipline.</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>When this was said, the venerable Mahā Moggallāna asked the venerable Sāriputta: "Friend Sāriputta, should these things be undertaken and practised only by a forest-dwelling bhikkhu or by one who dwells near a village as well?"</p>

<p>"Friend Moggallāna, these things should be undertaken and practised even by a forest-dwelling bhikkhu, how much more then by one who dwells near a village."</p>
