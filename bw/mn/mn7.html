<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n84"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.84] For a more thorough treatment of this sutta and the following one, with helpful introductions and lengthy explanatory notes, see Nyanaponika Thera, <a href="http://www.bps.lk/library-search-select.php?id=wh061"><i>The Simile of the Cloth and The Discourse on Effacement</i></a>.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. There he addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus."—"Venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Bhikkhus, suppose a cloth were defiled and stained, and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other, whether blue or yellow or red or carmine; it would look poorly dyed and impure in colour. Why is that? Because of the impurity of the cloth. So too, when the mind is defiled, an unhappy destination may be expected.<span class="note" id="n85"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.85] An unhappy destination <i>(duggati)</i> is rebirth in the three states of deprivation—hell, the animal kingdom, and the realm of ghosts. A happy destination <i>(sugati)</i>, mentioned just below, is rebirth in a superior state among humans and in the heavenly worlds.</span></span></span> Bhikkhus, suppose a cloth were pure and bright, and a dyer dipped it in some dye or other, whether blue or yellow or red or carmine; it would look well dyed and pure in colour. Why is that? Because of the purity of the cloth. So too, when the mind is undefiled, a happy destination may be expected.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"What, bhikkhus, are the imperfections that defile the mind?<span class="note" id="n86"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.86] <i>Cittassa upakkilesā.</i> The word upakkilesā is sometimes used in the sense of blemishes or imperfections of meditative concentration, as at <a href="mn128.html#p31">MN&nbsp;128.27, 30</a>; sometimes in the sense of blemishes or imperfections of insight, as at Vsm XX, 105; and sometimes to signify the minor defilements that arise from the three unwholesome roots—greed, hate, and delusion—either as their modes or their offshoots. Here it is used in this third sense, but to maintain the connection with its first two usages, it has been translated by the phrase "imperfections that defile the mind."</span></span></span> Covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection that defiles the mind. Ill will … anger … resentment … contempt … insolence … envy … avarice … deceit … fraud … obstinacy … rivalry … conceit … arrogance … vanity … negligence is an imperfection that defiles the mind.<span class="note" id="n87"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.87] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> offers several tentative distinctions between covetousness <i>(abhijjhā)</i> and unrighteous greed <i>(visamalobha)</i>, but then it points out that since, from the standpoint of the higher training, all greed is unrighteous, the two terms can be understood as merely different names for the same mental factor, greed or lust. Here I paraphrase MA's explanations of some of the other mental corruptions: Resentment <i>(upanāha)</i> sets in after anger has repeatedly enveloped the mind. Contempt <i>(makkha)</i> is the devaluation of benefits conferred on one by others. Insolence <i>(paḷāsa)</i> is presumption <i>(yugaggāha)</i> arising when one puts oneself at the same level as others who have superior qualities. Envy <i>(issā)</i> is resentment over the honours, etc., shown to others; avarice <i>(macchariya)</i> is unwillingness to share one's own possessions with others. Obstinacy <i>(thambha)</i> is inflexibility, stiffness, rigidity, like a bellows full of air. Rivalry <i>(sārambha)</i> is attempting to outdo others, the drive to surpass their achievements. Several of these corruptions are also defined at Vbh verses 845–46, 891–94.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Knowing that covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection that defiles the mind, a bhikkhu abandons it.<span class="note" id="n88"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.88] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> says that the abandoning spoken of here should be understood as "abandonment by eradication" <i>(samucchedappahāna)</i>, that is, complete uprooting by the supramundane path. The sixteen defilements are abandoned by the noble paths in the following order:</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">1. The path of stream-entry abandons: contempt, insolence, envy, avarice, deceit, fraud.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">2. The path of non-returning abandons: ill will, anger, resentment, negligence.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">3. The path of arahantship abandons: covetousness and unrighteous greed, obstinacy, rivalry, conceit, arrogance, vanity.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">MA maintains, by reference to an ancient exegetical source, that in this passage the path of the non-returner is being described. Therefore we must understand that those defilements to be fully abandoned by the path of arahantship have at this point only been abandoned in part, by way of their coarser manifestations.</span></span></span> Knowing that ill will … negligence is an imperfection that defiles the mind, a bhikkhu abandons it.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"When a bhikkhu has known that covetousness and unrighteous greed is an imperfection that defiles the mind and has abandoned it; when a bhikkhu has known that ill will … negligence is an imperfection that defiles the mind and has abandoned it,</p>

The formulas for recollection of the Buddha, Dhamma, and Saṅgha given here are explained at length in Vsm VII.</span></span></span>‘The Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’</p>

Ñm, following the reading <i>yathodhi,</i> translates: "And whatever (from among those imperfections) has, according to the limitation (set by whichever of the first three paths he has attained), been given up, has been (forever) dropped, let go, abandoned, relinquished."

<br>"When he knows and sees thus, his mind is liberated from the taint of sensual desire, from the taint of being, and from the taint of ignorance. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It is liberated.’ He understands: ‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being.’ Bhikkhus, this bhikkhu is called one bathed with the inner bathing."<span class="note" id="n97"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.97] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> The Buddha used this phrase to arouse the attention of the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja, who was in the assembly and believed in purification by ritual bathing. The Buddha foresaw that the brahmin would be inspired to take ordination under him and would attain arahantship.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Now on that occasion the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja was sitting not far from the Blessed One. Then he said to the Blessed One: "But does Master Gotama go to the Bāhukā River to bathe?"</p>

<p>"Why, brahmin, go to the Bāhukā River? What can the Bāhukā River do?"
<br>"Master Gotama, the Bāhukā River is held by many to give liberation, it is held by many to give merit, and many wash away their evil actions in the Bāhukā River."
<br>Then the Blessed One addressed the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja in stanzas:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Bāhukā and Adhikakkā,

<br>A fool may there forever bathe
<br>Yet will not purify dark deeds.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>What can the Sundarikā bring to pass?
<br>What the Payāga? What the Bāhukā?
<br>They cannot purify an evil-doer,
<br>A man who has done cruel and brutal deeds.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>One pure in heart has evermore
<br>The Feast of Spring, the Holy Day;<span class="note" id="n99"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.99] The Pali has <i>phaggu,</i> a day of brahmanical purification in the month of Phagguna (February–March), and <i>uposatha,</i> the religious observance days regulated by the lunar calendar.</span></span></span>

</div>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>When this was said, the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja said: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. I would receive the going forth under Master Gotama, I would receive the full admission."<span class="note" id="n100"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.100] The going forth <i>(pabbajjā)</i> is the formal ordination of entering the homeless life as a novice <i>(sāmaṇera)</i>; the full admission <i>(upasampadā)</i> confers the status of a bhikkhu, a full member of the Saṅgha.</span></span></span></p>

<p>And the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja received the going forth under the Blessed One, and he received the full admission. And soon, not long after his full admission, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, the venerable Bhāradvāja, by realising for himself with direct knowledge, here and now entered upon and abided in that supreme goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the home life into homelessness. He directly knew: "Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming to any state of being." And the venerable Bhāradvāja became one of the arahants.</p>
