<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n101"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.101] For a more thorough treatment of this sutta and the following one, with helpful introductions and lengthy explanatory notes, see Nyanaponika Thera, <i><a href="http://www.bps.lk/library-search-select.php?id=wh061">The Simile of the Cloth and The Discourse on Effacement</a>.</i></span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.

<br class="half">Then, when it was evening, the venerable Mahā Cunda rose from meditation and went to the Blessed One. After paying homage to the Blessed One he sat down at one side and said to him:</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, various views arise in the world associated either with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world. <span class="note" id="n102"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.102] Views associated with doctrines of a self <i>(attavāfapaṭsaṁyuttā)</i>, according to MA, are the twenty types of identity view enumerated at <a href="../mn/mn44.html#9">MN&nbsp;44.8</a>, though they may also be understood to include the more elaborate doctrines about a self discussed in <a id="clinging" href="../mn/mn102.html">MN&nbsp;102</a>. Views associated with doctrines about the world <i>(lokavādapaṭisaṁyuttā)</i> are the eight views: the world is eternal, non-eternal, both, or neither; the world is infinite, finite, both, or neither. See (see <a href="../mn/mn63.html">MN&nbsp;63</a>) and <a href="../mn/mn72.html">MN&nbsp;72 </a>for the Buddha’s rejection of these views.</span></span></span> Now does the abandoning and relinquishing of those views come about in a bhikkhu who is attending only to the beginning <span class="add">of his meditative training</span>?"<span class="note" id="n103"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.103] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA:</a> This question refers to one who has only reached the initial stages of insight meditation without attaining stream-entry. The type of abandonment under discussion is abandoning by eradication, which is effected only by the path of stream-entry. Ven. Mahā Cunda posed this question because some meditators were overestimating their achievement, thinking they had abandoned such views while they had not really eradicated them.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Cunda, as to those various views that arise in the world associated either with doctrines of a self or with doctrines about the world: if <span class="add">the object</span> in relation to which those views arise, which they underlie, and which they are exercised upon<span class="note" id="n104"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.104] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that the word "arise" <i>(uppajjanti)</i> refers here to the arising of views that have not arisen before; "underlie" <i>(anusenti)</i> to their gathering strength through continued adherence to them; and being "exercised" <i>(samudācaanti)</i> to their gaining bodily or verbal expression. The "object" upon which they are based is the five aggregates <i>(khandha)</i> that constitute a person or living being — material form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness.</span></span></span> is seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self,’ then the abandoning and relinquishing of those views comes about.<span class="note" id="n105"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.105] By this statement the Buddha shows the means by which these views are eradicated: contemplation of the five aggregates as "not mine," etc., with the wisdom of insight culminating in the path of stream-entry.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span class="add">The Eight Attainments</span></h3>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"It is possible here, Cunda, that quite secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of seclusion. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement. ’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One's Discipline.<span class="note" id="n106"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.106] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that the Buddha, having answered the Elder's question, now speaks of another type of overestimator — those who attain the eight meditative attainments and believe that they are practising true effacement <i>(sallekha)</i>. The word sallekha, originally meaning austerity or ascetic practice, is used by the Buddha to signify the radical effacing or removal of defilements. Though the eight attainments are elsewhere placed securely within the Buddhist training (see <a href="../mn/mn25.html#p18">MN&nbsp;25.12–19</a>, <a href="../mn/mn26.html#65">MN&nbsp;26.34–41</a>), it is here said that they should not be called effacement because the bhikkhu who attains them does not use them as a basis for insight — as described for example in <a href="../mn/mn52.html">MN&nbsp;52 </a>and <a href="../mn/mn64.html">MN&nbsp;64 </a>but only as a means of enjoying bliss and peace.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"It is possible here that with the stilling of applied and sustained thought, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the second jhāna, which has self-confidence and singleness of mind without applied and sustained thought, with rapture and pleasure born of concentration. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But … these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"It is possible here that with the fading away as well of rapture, some bhikkhu abides in equanimity, and mindful and fully aware, still feeling pleasure with the body, he enters upon and abides in the third jhāna, on account of which noble ones announce: ‘He has a pleasant abiding who has equanimity and is mindful.’ He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But … these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"It is possible here that with the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous disappearance of joy and grief, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the fourth jhāna, which has neither-pain-nor-pleasure and purity of mindfulness due to equanimity. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called ‘pleasant abidings here and now’ in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"It is possible here that with the complete surmounting of perceptions of form, with the disappearance of perceptions of sensory impact, with non-attention to perceptions of diversity, aware that ‘space is infinite,’ some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite space. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But it is not these attainments that are called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called ‘peaceful abidings’ in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of infinite space, aware that ‘consciousness is infinite,’ some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of infinite consciousness. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But … these are called ‘peaceful abidings’ in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of infinite consciousness, aware that ‘there is nothing,’ some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of nothingness. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But … these are called ‘peaceful abidings’ in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"It is possible here that by completely surmounting the base of nothingness, some bhikkhu enters upon and abides in the base of neither-perception-nor-non-perception. He might think thus: ‘I am abiding in effacement.’ But these attainments are not called ‘effacement’ in the Noble One's Discipline: these are called ‘peaceful abidings’ in the Noble One's Discipline.</p>

<h2><span class="add">Effacement</span></h2>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Now, Cunda, here effacement should be practised by you:<span class="note" id="n107"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.107] The forty-four "modes of effacement" to be expounded fall, by and large, into several fixed sets of doctrinal categories as follows.

The Pali original for the expression to follow, "by which to extinguish it," parinibbānaya, might have been rendered "for attaining Nibbāna."
