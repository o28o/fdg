<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>So I have heard. At one time the Buddha was wandering in the land of the Kurus together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants when he arrived at a town of the Kurus named Thullakoṭṭhita.</p>

<p>The brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita heard:</p>

<hr>

<p>“It seems the ascetic Gotama — a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family — has arrived at Thullakoṭṭhita, together with a large Saṅgha of mendicants. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ He has realized with his own insight this world — with its gods, Māras and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, gods and humans — and he makes it known to others. He teaches Dhamma that’s good in the beginning, good in the middle, and good in the end, meaningful and well-phrased. And he reveals a spiritual practice that’s entirely full and pure. It’s good to see such perfected ones.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita went up to the Buddha. Before sitting down to one side, some bowed, some exchanged greetings and polite conversation, some held up their joined palms toward the Buddha, some announced their name and clan, while some kept silent. When they were seated, the Buddha educated, encouraged, fired up, and inspired them with a Dhamma talk.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Now at that time a gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhita, was sitting in the assembly. He thought: “As I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. Why don’t I cut off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from lay life to homelessness?”</p>

<p>Then, having approved and agreed with what the Buddha said, the brahmins and householders of Thullakoṭṭhita got up from their seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on their right, before leaving.</p>

<p>Soon after they left, Raṭṭhapāla went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Sir, as I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. I wish to cut off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence? May the Buddha please give me the going forth!”</p>

<hr>

<p>“But, Raṭṭhapāla, do you have your parents’ permission?”</p>

<p>“No, sir.”</p>

<hr>

<p>“Raṭṭhapāla, Buddhas don’t give the going forth to the child of parents who haven’t given their permission.”</p>

<hr>

<p>“I’ll make sure, sir, to get my parents’ permission.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha. Then he went to his parents and said: “Mum and dad, as I understand the Buddha’s teachings, it’s not easy for someone living at home to lead the spiritual life utterly full and pure, like a polished shell. I wish to cut off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. Please give me permission to go forth.”</p>

<p>When he said this, Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him: “But, dear Raṭṭhapāla, you’re our only child. You’re dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort. You know nothing of suffering. When you die we will lose you against our wishes. So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p5-6"><span class="parno">5-6</span>For a second time, and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla asked his parents for permission, but got the same reply.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then Raṭṭhapāla thought: “My parents don’t allow me to go forth.” He laid down there on the bare ground, saying: “I’ll either die right here or go forth.” And he refused to eat, up to the seventh meal.</p>

<p>Then Raṭṭhapāla’s parents said to him: “Dear Raṭṭhapāla, you’re our only child. You’re dear to us and we love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort. You know nothing of suffering. When you die we will lose you against our wishes. So how can we allow you to go forth from lay life to homelessness while you’re still living? Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Eat, drink, and amuse yourself. While enjoying sensual pleasures, delight in making merit. We don’t allow you to go forth. When you die we will lose you against our wishes. So how can we allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”</p>

<p>When they said this, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>For a second time, and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla’s parents made the same request. And for a third time, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent. <br>

<br>Raṭṭhapāla’s parents then went to see his friends. They told them of the situation and asked for their help.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to him and said: “Our friend Raṭṭhapāla, you are your parents’ only child. You’re dear to them and they love you. You’re dainty and raised in comfort. You know nothing of suffering. When you die your parents will lose you against their wishes. So how can they allow you to go forth while you’re still alive? Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Eat, drink, and amuse yourself. While enjoying sensual pleasures, delight in making merit. Your parents will not allow you to go forth. When you die your parents will lose you against their wishes. So how can they allow you to go forth while you’re still alive?”</p>

<p>When they said this, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>For a second time, and a third time, Raṭṭhapāla’s friends made the same request. And for a third time, Raṭṭhapāla kept silent.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to his parents and said: “Mum and dad, Raṭṭhapāla is lying there on the bare ground saying: ‘I’ll either die right here or go forth.’ If you don’t allow him to go forth, he’ll die there. But if you do allow him to go forth, you’ll see him again afterwards. And if he doesn’t enjoy the renunciate life, where else will he have to go? He’ll come right back here. Please give Raṭṭhapāla permission to go forth.”</p>

<p>“Then, dears, we give Raṭṭhapāla permission to go forth. But once gone forth he must visit his parents.”</p>

<p>Then Raṭṭhapāla’s friends went to him and said: “Get up, Raṭṭhapāla! Your parents have given you permission to go forth from lay life to homelessness. But once gone forth you must visit your parents.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>Raṭṭhapāla got up and regained his strength. He went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Sir, I have my parents’ permission to go forth from the lay life to homelessness. May the Buddha please give me the going forth.”</p>

<p>And Raṭṭhapāla received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. Not long after Venerable Raṭṭhapāla’s ordination, a fortnight later, the Buddha — having stayed in Thullakoṭṭhita as long as he wished — set out for Sāvatthī. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Sāvatthī, where he stayed in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s monastery.</p>

<hr>

<p>Then Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, living alone, withdrawn, diligent, keen, and resolute, soon realized the supreme end of the spiritual path in this very life. He lived having achieved with his own insight the goal for which gentlemen rightly go forth from the lay life to homelessness.</p>

<p>He understood: “Rebirth is ended; the spiritual journey has been completed; what had to be done has been done; there is no return to any state of existence.” And Venerable Raṭṭhapāla became one of the perfected.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Then he went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him: “Sir, I’d like to visit my parents, if the Buddha allows it.”</p>

<p>Then the Buddha focused on comprehending Raṭṭhapāla’s mind. When he knew that it was impossible for Raṭṭhapāla to reject the training and return to a lesser life, he said: “Please, Raṭṭhapāla, go at your convenience.”</p>

<p>And then Raṭṭhapāla got up from his seat, bowed, and respectfully circled the Buddha, keeping him on his right. Then he set his lodgings in order and, taking his bowl and robe, set out for Thullakoṭṭhita. Traveling stage by stage, he arrived at Thullakoṭṭhika, where he stayed in King Koravya’s deer raṅge. Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, entered Thullakoṭṭhita for alms. Wandering indiscriminately for alms-food, he approached his own father’s house.</p>

<p>Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla’s father was having his hair dressed in the hall of the middle gate. He saw Raṭṭhapāla coming off in the distance and said,</p>

<p>“Our dear and beloved only son was made to go forth by these shavelings, these fake ascetics!” And at his own father’s house Raṭṭhapāla received neither alms nor a polite refusal, but only abuse.</p>

<hr>

<p>Now at that time a family bondservant wanted to throw away the previous night’s porridge. So Raṭṭhapāla said to her: “If that’s to be thrown away, sister, pour it here in my bowl.” As she was pouring the porridge into his bowl, she recognized the features of his hands, feet, and voice.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>She then went to his mother and said: “Please, madam, you should know this. My lord Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.”</p>

<p>“Wow! If you speak the truth, I’ll make you a free woman!”</p>

<hr>

<p>Then Raṭṭhapāla’s mother went to his father and said: “Please householder, you should know this. It seems our son Raṭṭhapāla has arrived.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Now at that time Raṭṭhapāla was eating last night’s porridge by a wall. Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father went up to him and said: “Dear Raṭṭhapāla! There’s … and you’ll be eating last night’s porridge! Why not go to your own home?”</p>

<p>“Householder, how could those of us who have gone forth from the lay life to homelessness have a house? We’re homeless, householder. I came to your house, but there I received neither alms nor a polite refusal, but only abuse.”</p>

<p>“Come, dear Raṭṭhapāla, let’s go to the house.”</p>

<p>“Enough, householder. My meal is finished for today.”</p>

<p>“Well then, dear Raṭṭhapāla, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” Raṭṭhapāla consented in silence.</p>

<hr>

<p>Then, knowing that Raṭṭhapāla had consented, his father went back to his own house. He made a heap of gold coins and bullion and hid it under mats. Then he addressed Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives: “Please, daughters-in-law, adorn yourselves in the way that our son Raṭṭhapāla found you most adorable.”</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>And when the night had passed Raṭṭhapāla’s father had a variety of delicious foods prepared in his own home, and announced the time to the Venerable Raṭṭhapāla, saying: “Sir, it’s time. The meal is ready.”</p>

<p>Then Raṭṭhapāla robed up in the morning and, taking his bowl and robe, went to his father’s home, and sat down on the seat spread out. Raṭṭhapāla’s father, revealing the heap of gold coins and bullion, said to him: “Dear Raṭṭhapāla, this is your maternal fortune. There’s another paternal fortune, and an ancestral one. You can both enjoy your wealth and make merit. Come, return to a lesser life, enjoy wealth, and make merit!”</p>

<p>“If you’d follow my advice, householder, you’d have this heap of gold loaded on a cart and carried away to be dumped in the middle of the Ganges river. Why is that? Because this will bring you nothing but sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness, and distress.”</p>

<p>Then Raṭṭhapāla’s former wives each clasped his feet and said: “What are they like, lord, the nymphs for whom you lead the spiritual life?”</p>

<p>“Sisters, I don’t lead the spiritual life for the sake of nymphs.”</p>

<p>Saying: “Our lord Raṭṭhapāla refers to us as sisters!” they fainted right away.</p>

<p>Then Raṭṭhapāla said to his father: “If there is food to be given, householder, please give it. But don’t harass me.”</p>

<p>“Eat, dear Raṭṭhapāla. The meal is ready.” Then Raṭṭhapāla’s father served and satisfied Venerable Raṭṭhapāla with his own hands with a variety of delicious foods.</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>When he had eaten and washed his hand and bowl, he recited these verses while standing right there:</p>


<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>“See this fancy puppet,<br>a body built of sores,<br>diseased, obsessed over,<br>which doesn’t last at all.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>See this fancy figure,<br>with its gems and earrings;<br>it is bones wrapped in skin,<br>made pretty by its clothes.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>Rouged feet<br>and powdered face<br>may be enough to beguile a fool,<br>but not a seeker of the far shore.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>Hair in eight braids<br>and eyeliner<br>may be enough to beguile a fool,<br>but not a seeker of the far shore.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>A rotting body all adorned<br>like a freshly painted makeup box<br>may be enough to beguile a fool,<br>but not a seeker of the far shore.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>The hunter laid his snare,<br>but the deer didn’t spring the trap.<br>I’ve eaten the bait and now I go,<br>leaving the trapper to lament.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>Then Raṭṭhapāla, having recited this verse while standing, went to King Koravya’s deer range and sat at the root of a tree for the day’s meditation.</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>Then King Koravya addressed his gamekeeper: “My good gamekeeper, tidy up the park of the deer raṅge. We will go to see the scenery.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Your Majesty,” replied the gamekeeper. While tidying the deer range he saw Raṭṭhapāla sitting in meditation. Seeing this, he went to the king, and said: “The deer range is tidy, sire. And the gentleman named Raṭṭhapāla, the son of the leading clan in Thullakoṭṭhita, of whom you have often spoken highly, is meditating there at the root of a tree.”</p>

<p>“Well then, my good gamekeeper, that’s enough of the park for today. Now I shall pay homage to the Master Raṭṭhapāla.”</p>

<p>And then King Koravya said: “Give away all the different foods that have been prepared there.” He had the finest carriages harnessed. Then he mounted a fine carriage and, along with other fine carriages, set out in full royal pomp from Thullakoṭṭhita to see Raṭṭhapāla. He went by carriage as far as the terrain allowed, then descended and approached Raṭṭhapāla on foot, together with a group of eminent officials. They exchanged greetings, and, when the greetings and polite conversation were over, he stood to one side, and said to Raṭṭhapāla:</p>

<p>“Here, Master Raṭṭhapāla, sit on this elephant rug.”</p>

<p>“Enough, great king, you sit on it. I’m sitting on my own seat.”</p>

<p>So the king sat down on the seat spread out, and said:</p>

<p>“Master Raṭṭhapāla, there are these four kinds of decay. Because of these, some people shave off their hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness. What four? Decay due to old age, decay due to sickness, decay of wealth, and decay of relatives.</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>And what is decay due to old age? It’s when someone is old, elderly, and senior, advanced in years, and has reached the final stage of life.

It’s not easy for me to acquire more wealth or to increase the wealth I’ve already acquired. Why don’t I shave off my hair and beard, dress in ocher robes, and go forth from the lay life to homelessness?’ So because of that decay due to old age they go forth. This is called decay due to old age. But Master Raṭṭhapāla is now a youth, young, black-haired, blessed with youth, in the prime of life. You have no decay due to old age. So what did you know or see or hear that made you go forth?</p>

<p>‘The world is unstable and swept away.’ This is the first summary.</p>
