<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the venerable Mahā Kaccāna was living at Madhurā in the Gundā Grove.<span class="note" id="n814"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.814] Ven. Mahā Kaccāna was declared by the Buddha to be the most eminent disciple in expounding the detailed meaning of a brief saying. <a href="mn133.html">MN&nbsp;133</a> and <a href="mn138.html">MN&nbsp;138</a> were also spoken by him under similar circumstances.</span></span></span></p>

<p>King Avantiputta of Madhurā heard: "The recluse Kaccāna is living at Madhurā in the Gundā Grove. Now a good report of Master Kaccāna has been spread to this effect: ‘He is wise, discerning, sagacious, learned, articulate, and perspicacious; he is aged and he is an arahant. It is good to see such arahants.’"</p>

<p>Then King Avantiputta of Madhurā had a number of state carriages made ready, and mounting a state carriage, he drove out from Madhurā with the full pomp of royalty in order to see the venerable Mahā Kaccāna. He went thus as far as the road was passable for carriages, and then he got down from his carriage and went forward on foot to the venerable Mahā Kaccāna. He exchanged greetings with him, and when this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said:</p>

<p>"Master Kaccāna, the brahmins say thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste, those of any other caste are inferior; brahmins are the fairest caste, those of any other caste are dark; only brahmins are purified, not non-brahmins; brahmins alone are the sons of Brahmā, the offspring of Brahmā, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’ What does Master Kaccāna say about that?"</p>

<p>"It is just a saying in the world, great king, that ‘Brahmins are the highest caste … heirs of Brahmā.’ And there is a way whereby it can be understood how that statement of the brahmins is just a saying in the world.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"What do you think, great king? If a noble prospers in wealth, grain, silver, or gold, will there be nobles who rise before him and retire after him, who are eager to serve him, who seek to please him and speak sweetly to him, and will there also be brahmins, merchants, and workers who do likewise?"</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>When this was said, King Avantiputta of Madhurā said to the venerable Mahā Kaccāna: "Magnificent, Master Kaccāna! Magnificent, Master Kaccāna! Master Kaccāna has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who is lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Kaccāna for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life."</p>

<hr>
<p>"Do not go to me for refuge, great king. Go for refuge to that same Blessed One to whom I have gone for refuge."</p>

<p>"Where is he living now, Master Kaccāna, that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened?"</p>

<p>"That Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened, has attained to final Nibbāna, great king."</p>

<p>"If we heard that that Blessed One was within ten leagues, we would go ten leagues in order to see that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened. If we heard that that Blessed One was within twenty leagues … thirty leagues … forty leagues … fifty leagues … a hundred leagues, we would go a hundred leagues in order to see that Blessed One, accomplished and fully enlightened. But since that Blessed One has attained to final Nibbāna, we go to that Blessed One for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Kaccāna remember me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life."</p>
