<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

<p>Then, when it was morning, the venerable Ānanda dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, went into Sāvatthī for alms. When he had wandered for alms in Sāvatthī and had returned from his almsround, after his meal he went to the Eastern Park, to the Palace of Migāra's Mother, for the day's abiding.</p>

<p>Now on that occasion King Pasenadi of Kosala had mounted the elephant Ekapuṇḍarīka and was riding out from Sāvatthī at midday. He saw the venerable Ānanda coming in the distance and asked the minister Sirivaḍḍha: "That is the venerable Ānanda, is it not?" — "Yes, sire, that is the venerable Ānanda."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then King Pasenadi of Kosala told a man: "Come, good man, go to the venerable Ānanda and pay homage in my name with your head at his feet, saying: ‘Venerable sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage with his head at the venerable Ānanda's feet.’ Then say this: ‘Venerable sir, if the venerable Ānanda has no urgent business, perhaps the venerable Ānanda would wait a moment, out of compassion.’"</p>

<p>"Yes, sire," the man replied, and he went to the venerable Ānanda, and after paying homage to him, he stood at one side and said to the venerable Ānanda: "Venerable sir, King Pasenadi of Kosala pays homage with his head at the venerable Ānanda's feet and he says this: ‘Venerable sir, if the venerable Ānanda has no urgent business, perhaps the venerable Ānanda would wait a moment, out of compassion.’"</p>

<hr>
<p>The venerable Ānanda consented in silence.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then King Pasenadi went by elephant as far as the elephant could go, and then he dismounted and went to the venerable Ānanda on foot. After paying homage to him, he stood at one side and said to the venerable Ānanda: "If, venerable sir, the venerable Ānanda has no urgent business, it would be good if he would go to the bank of the river Aciravatī, out of compassion."</p>

<hr>
<p>The venerable Ānanda consented in silence.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>He went to the bank of the river Aciravatī and sat down at the root of a tree on a seat made ready. Then King Pasenadi went by elephant as far as the elephant could go, and then he dismounted and went to the venerable Ānanda on foot. After paying homage to him, he stood at one side and said to the venerable Ānanda: "Here, venerable sir, is an elephant rug. Let the venerable Ānanda be seated on it."</p>

<hr>
<p>"There is no need, great king. Sit down. I am sitting on my own mat."</p>

<p>King Pasenadi of Kosala sat down on a seat made ready and said: "Venerable Ānanda, would the Blessed One behave with the body in such a way that he could be censured by recluses and brahmins?"<span class="note" id="n831"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.831] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains that the king asked this question with reference to the case involving the female wanderer Sundarī, which was pending investigation at the time. Wishing to discredit the Buddha, some wandering ascetics persuaded Sundarī to visit Jeta's Grove at night and then let herself be seen returning at dawn, so people would become suspicious. After some time they had her murdered and buried near Jeta's Grove, and when her body was discovered there, they pointed an accusing finger at the Buddha. After a week the false report was exposed when the king's spies found out the real story behind the murder. See <a href="../ud/ud4.8.html">Ud&nbsp;4:8/42–45</a>.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">I follow here BBS and SBJ, which add the qualification "wise" to the phrase "recluses and brahmins" <i>(samaṇehi brāhmaṇehi viññūhi)</i>. Ānanda's answer thus implies that it is their censure and not that of ordinary ascetics that should be avoided. That this reading is correct is supported by the king's statement just below that Ānanda has done with his answer what he himself could not do with the question, namely, distinguish between the wise and the foolish.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Great king, the Blessed One would not behave with the body in such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahmins."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Would the Blessed One, venerable Ānanda, behave with speech … behave with the mind in such a way that he could be censured by recluses and brahmins?"</p>

<p>"Great king, the Blessed One would not behave with speech … behave with the mind in such a way that he could be censured by wise recluses and brahmins."</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"It is wonderful, venerable sir, it is marvellous! For what we were unable to accomplish with a question has been accomplished by the venerable Ānanda with the answer to the question. We do not recognise anything of value in the praise and blame of others spoken by foolish ignorant persons, who speak without having investigated and evaluated; but we recognise as valuable the praise and blame of others spoken by wise, intelligent, and sagacious persons who speak after having investigated and evaluated.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Now, venerable Ānanda, what kind of bodily behaviour is censured by wise recluses and brahmins?"<span class="note" id="n832"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.832] Briefly, this passage offers five criteria of evil actions: <i>unwholesomeness</i> underscores the psychological quality of the action, its unhealthy effect upon the mind; its being <i>blameworthy</i> underscores its morally detrimental nature; its capacity to produce <i>painful results</i> calls attention to its undesirable kammic potential; and the last statement calls attention to both its evil <i>motivation</i> and the harmful long-raṅge <i>consequences</i> such action entails for both oneself and others. The opposite explanation applies to good action, discussed in ¶18.</span></span></span></p>

Venerable sir, we are so satisfied and pleased with what has been so well expressed by the venerable Ānanda that if the elephant-treasure were allowed to him, we would give it to him; if the horse-treasure were allowed to him, we would give it to him; if the boon of a village were allowed to him, we would give it to him. But we know, venerable sir, that these are not allowable for the venerable Ānanda. But there is this cloak of mine,<span class="note" id="n834"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.834] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> explains the word <i>bāhitikā,</i> after which the sutta is named, as a cloak produced in a foreign country.</span></span></span> venerable sir, which was sent to me packed in a royal umbrella case by King Ajātasattu of Magadha, sixteen hands long and eight hands wide.

<p>"It is not necessary, great king. My triple robe is complete."</p>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>"Venerable sir, this river Aciravatī has been seen both by the venerable Ānanda and by ourselves when a great cloud has rained heavily on the mountains; then this river Aciravatī overflows both its banks.

In this way, our offering will overflow. Venerable sir, let the venerable Ānanda accept the cloak."</p>

<p>Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, having delighted and rejoiced in the venerable Ānanda's words, rose from his seat, and after paying homage to the venerable Ānanda, keeping him on his right, he departed.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>Then soon after he had left, the venerable Ānanda went to the Blessed One, and after paying homage to him, he sat down at one side, related to him his entire conversation with King Pasenadi of Kosala, and presented the cloak to the Blessed One.</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: "It is a gain, bhikkhus, for King Pasenadi of Kosala, it is a great gain for King Pasenadi of Kosala that he has had the opportunity of seeing and paying respect to Ānanda."</p>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>That is what the Blessed One said. The bhikkhus were satisfied and delighted in the Blessed One's words.</p>
