<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park.</p>

<p>Now at that time five hundred brahmins from diverse provinces were staying at Sāvatthī for some business or other. Then those brahmins thought: "This recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes.<span class="note" id="n869"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.869] The argument in favour of this thesis is set forth at <a href="mn90.html#p5a">MN&nbsp;90.10–12</a>.</span></span></span> Who is there able to dispute with him about this assertion?"</p>

<p>Now on that occasion a brahmin student named Assalāyana was staying at Sāvatthī. Young, shaven-headed, sixteen years old, he was a master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology, and etymology, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology and grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. Then the brahmins thought: "There is this young brahmin student named Assalāyana staying at Sāvatthī. Young … fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a Great Man. He will be able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>So the brahmins went to the brahmin student Assalāyana and said to him: "Master Assalāyana, this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Let Master Assalāyana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>When this was said, the brahmin student Assalāyana replied: "Sirs, the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>A second time the brahmins said to him: "Master Assalāyana, this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Let Master Assalāyana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion. For the training of a wanderer has been completed by Master Assalāyana."<span class="note" id="n870"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.870] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: They speak thus intending to say: "Having studied the Three Vedas, you have trained in the mantras by which those who go forth undertake their going forth and the mantras they maintain after they have gone forth. You have practised their mode of conduct. Therefore, you will not be defeated. Victory will be yours."</span></span></span></p>

<p>For the second time the brahmin student Assalāyana replied: "Sirs, the recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma. Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>A third time the brahmins said to him: "Master Assalāyana, this recluse Gotama describes purification for all the four castes. Let Master Assalāyana come and dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion. For the training of a wanderer has been completed by Master Assalāyana. Let not the Master Assalāyana be defeated without having even fought the battle."</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>When this was said, the brahmin student Assalāyana replied: "Surely, Sirs, I am not getting through to you when I say: ’The recluse Gotama is one who speaks the Dhamma.’ Now those who speak the Dhamma are difficult to dispute with. I am not able to dispute with the recluse Gotama about this assertion. Still, sirs, at your bidding I will go."</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then the brahmin student Assalāyana went with a large number of brahmins to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, he sat down at one side and said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, the brahmins say thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste, those of any other caste are inferior; brahmins are the fairest caste, those of any other caste are dark; only brahmins are purified, not non-brahmins; brahmins alone are the sons of Brahmā, the offspring of Brahmā, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’ What does Master Gotama say about that?"</p>

<p>"Now, Assalāyana, the brahmin women are seen having their periods, becoming pregnant, giving birth, and giving suck.<span class="note" id="n871"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.871] This statement is intended to show that brahmins are born of women, just like other human beings, and there is thus no substance to their claim that they are born of Brahmā's mouth.</span></span></span> And yet those brahmins, though born from the womb, say thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste … brahmins alone are the sons of Brahmā, the offspring of Brahmā, born of his mouth, born of Brahmā, created by Brahmā, heirs of Brahmā.’"</p>

<p>"Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste … heirs of Brahmā.’"</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"What do you think, Assalāyana? Have you heard that in Yona and Kamboja<span class="note" id="n872"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.872] <i>Yona</i> is the Pali transliteration of Ionia. <i>Kamboja</i> is a region to the northwest of the Indian "Middle Country."</span></span></span> and in other outland countries there are only two castes, masters and slaves, and that masters become slaves and slaves masters?"</p>

<p>"So I have heard, sir."</p>

<p>"Then on the strength of what <span class="add">argument</span> or with the support of what <span class="add">authority</span> do the brahmins in this case say thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste … heirs of Brahmā’?"</p>

<p>"Although Master Gotama says this, still the brahmins think thus: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste … heirs of Brahmā.’"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"What do you think, Assalāyana?<span class="note" id="n873"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.873] The argument of ¶¶8–9 here is substantially identical with that of <a href="mn84.html">MN&nbsp;84</a>.</span></span></span> Suppose a noble were to kill living beings, take what is not given, misconduct himself in sensual pleasures, speak falsely, speak maliciously, speak harshly, gossip, be covetous, have a mind of ill will, and hold wrong view. On the dissolution of the body, after death, would only he <span class="add">be likely to</span> reappear in a state of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell — and not a brahmin?

<p>"No, Master Gotama.

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"What do you think, Assalāyana? Suppose a head-anointed noble king were to assemble here a hundred men of different birth and say to them: ‘Come, sirs, let any here who have been born into a noble clan or a brahmin clan or a royal clan take an upper fire-stick of sāla wood, salala wood, sandalwood, or padumaka wood and light a fire and produce heat. And also let any who have been born into an outcast clan, a trapper clan, a wicker workers’ clan, a cartwrights’ clan, or a scavengers’ clan take an upper fire-stick made from a dog's drinking trough, from a pig's trough, from a dustbin, or from castor-oil wood and light a fire and produce heat.’</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"What do you think, Assalāyana?

<p>"No, Master Gotama. When a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone in the first group, that fire would have a flame, a colour, and a radiance, and it would be possible to use it for the purposes of fire. And when a fire is lit and heat is produced by someone of the second group, that fire too would have a flame, a colour, and a radiance, and it would be possible to use it for the purposes of fire. For all fire has a flame, a colour, and a radiance, and it is possible to use all fire for the purposes of fire."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"What do you think, Assalāyana? Suppose a noble youth were to cohabit with a brahmin girl, and a son was born from their cohabitation. Should a son born from a noble youth and a brahmin girl be called a noble after the father or a brahmin after the mother?"</p>

<p>"He could be called both, Master Gotama."</p>

<p>"It is a mule, Master Gotama, since it does not belong to either kind. I see the difference in this last case, but I see no difference in either of the former cases."</p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"What do you think, Assalāyana? Suppose there were two brahmin students who were brothers, born of the same mother, one studious and acute, and one neither studious nor acute. Which of them would brahmins feed first at a funeral feast, or at a ceremonial milk-rice offering, or at a sacrificial feast, or at a feast for guests?"</p>

<p>"On such occasions, brahmins would feed first the one who was studious and acute, Master Gotama; for how could what is given to one who is neither studious nor acute bring great fruit?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"What do you think, Assalāyana? Suppose there were two brahmin students who were brothers, born of the same mother, one studious and acute, but immoral and of bad character, and one neither studious nor acute, but virtuous and of good character.

<p>"On such occasions, brahmins would feed first the one who was neither studious nor acute, but virtuous and of good character, Master Gotama; for how could what is given to one who is immoral and of bad character bring great fruit?"</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"First, Assalāyana, you took your stand on birth, and after that you took your stand on scriptural learning, and after that you have come to take your stand on the very ground that purification is for all four castes, as I describe it."</p>

<p>When this was said, the brahmin student Assalāyana sat silent and dismayed, with shoulders drooping and head down, glum, and without response. Knowing this, the Blessed One said to him:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"Once, Assalāyana, when seven brahmin seers were consulting together in leaf huts in the forest, this pernicious view arose in them: ‘Brahmins are the highest caste … … heirs of Brahmā.’ Now the seer Devala the Dark heard this.<span class="note" id="n874"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.874] <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a> identifies Devala the Dark, Asita Devala, with the Buddha in an earlier life. The Buddha undertakes this teaching to show: "In the past, when you were of a superior birth and I was of an inferior birth, you could not answer a question I asked you about an assertion concerning birth. So how can you do so now, when you are inferior and I have become a Buddha?"</span></span></span> Then he arranged his hair and beard, dressed in ochre-coloured garments, put on stout sandals, and taking a staff made of gold, he appeared in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers. Then, while walking up and down the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers, the seer Devala the Dark spoke thus: ‘Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone? Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone?’ Then the seven brahmin seers thought: ‘Who is walking up and down in the courtyard of the seven brahmin seers like a village lout speaking thus: "Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone? Where have those worthy brahmin seers gone?" Let us curse him!’ Then the seven brahmin seers cursed the seer Devala the Dark thus: ‘Be ashes, vile one! Be ashes, vile one!’ But the more the seven brahmin seers cursed him, the more comely, beautiful, and handsome the seer Devala the Dark became. Then the seven brahmin seers thought: ‘Our asceticism is in vain, our holy life is fruitless; for formerly when we cursed anyone thus: "Be ashes, vile one!

<p>"Now, Assalāyana, even those seven brahmin seers, on being pressed and questioned and cross-questioned by the seer Devala the Dark on their own assertion about birth, were unable to support it. But how shall you, on being pressed and questioned and cross-questioned by me now on your assertion about birth, be able to support it?

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>When this was said, the brahmin student Assalāyana said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the dark for those with eyesight to see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge and to the Dhamma and to the Saṅgha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge for life."</p>
