<section class="raw_sutta">
<div lang="en">
<p><span class="parno">1</span><span>So I have heard. </span>At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala.</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.</p>

<p>Then as the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question of how one is a brahmin.</p>

<hr>

<p>Bhāradvāja said this: “When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation — then you’re a brahmin.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Vāseṭṭha said this: “When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties — then you’re a brahmin.”</p>

<hr>

<p>But neither was able to persuade the other.</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja: “Master Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama — a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family — is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Bhāradvāja.</p>

<p><hr>
<p><span class="parno">5</span>So they went to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse:</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse">
	<span class="parno">6</span>
	“We’re both authorized masters 
	<br>of the three Vedas. 
	<br>I’m a student of Pokkharasāti, 
	<br>and he of Tārukkha.</p>


<p class="verse">
	<span class="parno">7</span>	
	We’re fully qualified 
	<br>in all the Vedic experts teach. 
	<br>As philologists and grammarians, 
	<br>we match our teachers in recitation. 
	<br>We have a dispute 
	<br>regarding the question of ancestry.</p>


<p class="verse"><span class="parno">8</span>
	For Bhāradvāja says that 
	<br>one is a brahmin due to birth, 
	<br>but I declare it’s because of one’s actions. 
	<br>Oh seer, know this as our debate.</p>


<p class="verse"><span class="parno">9</span>
	Since neither of us was able 
	<br>to convince the other, 
	<br>we’ve come to ask you, sir, 
	<br>so renowned as the awakened one.</p>


<p class="verse"><span class="parno">10</span>
	As people honor with joined palms 
	<br>the moon on the cusp of waxing, 
	<br>bowing, they revere 
	<br>Gotama in the world.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">11</span>
	We ask this of Gotama, 
	<br>the eye arisen in the world: 
	<br>is one a brahmin due to birth, 
	<br>or else because of actions? 
	<br>We don’t know, please tell us, 
	<br>so that we can know a brahmin.”</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">12</span>
	“I shall explain to you,” said the Buddha, 
	<br>“accurately and in sequence, 
	<br>the taxonomy of living creatures, 
	<br>for species are indeed diverse.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">13</span>
	Know the grass and trees, 
	<br>though they lack self-awareness. 
	<br>They’re defined by their birth, 
	<br>for species are indeed diverse.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">14</span>
	Next there are bugs and moths, 
	<br>and so on, to ants and termites. 
	<br>They’re defined by their birth, 
	<br>for species are indeed diverse.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">15</span>
	Know the quadrupeds, too, 
	<br>both small and large. 
	<br>They’re defined by their birth, 
	<br>for species are indeed diverse.</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">16</span>
	Know, too, the long-backed snakes, 
	<br>crawling on their bellies. 
	<br>They’re defined by their birth, 
	<br>for species are indeed diverse.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">17</span>
	Next know the fish, 
	<br>whose habitat is the water. 
	<br>They’re defined by their birth, 
	<br>for species are indeed diverse.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">18</span>
	Next know the birds, 
	<br>flying with wings as chariots. 
	<br>They’re defined by their birth, 
	<br>for species are indeed diverse.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">19</span>
	While the differences between these species 
	<br>are defined by their birth, 
	<br>the differences between humans 
	<br>are not defined by their birth.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">20</span>
	Not by hair nor by head, 
	<br>not by ear nor by eye, 
	<br>not by mouth nor by nose, 
	<br>not by lips nor by eyebrow,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">21</span>
	not by shoulder nor by neck, 
	<br>not by belly nor by back, 
	<br>not by buttocks nor by breast, 
	<br>not by genitals nor by groin,</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">22</span>
	not by hands nor by feet, 
	<br>not by fingers nor by nails, 
	<br>not by knees nor by thighs, 
	<br>not by color nor by voice: 
	<br>none of these are defined by birth 
	<br>as it is for other species.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">23</span>
	In individual human bodies 
	<br>you can’t find such distinctions. 
	<br>The distinctions among humans 
	<br>are spoken of by convention.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">24</span>
	Anyone among humans 
	<br>who lives off keeping cattle: 
	<br>know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
	<br>as a farmer, not a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">25</span>
	Anyone among humans 
	<br>who lives off various professions:

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">27</span>
	Anyone among humans

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">28</span>
	Anyone among humans 
	<br>who lives off stealing:

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">29</span>
	Anyone among humans 
	<br>who lives off archery: 
	<br>know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
	<br>as a soldier, not a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">30</span>
	Anyone among humans 
	<br>who lives off priesthood: 
	<br>know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
	<br>as a sacrificer, not a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">31</span>
	Anyone among humans 
	<br>who taxes village and nation, 
	<br>know them, Vāseṭṭha, 
	<br>as a ruler, not a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">32</span>
	I don’t call someone a brahmin 
	<br>after the mother or womb they came from. 
	<br>If they still have attachments, 
	<br>they’re just someone who says ‘sir’. 
	<br>One with nothing, by not grasping: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">33</span>
	Having cut off all fetters 
	<br>they have no anxiety. 
	<br>They’ve got over clinging, and are detached: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">34</span>
	They’ve cut the strap and harness, 
	<br>the reins and bridle too, 
	<br>with cross-bar lifted, they’re awakened: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">35</span>
	Abuse, killing, caging: 
	<br>they endure these without anger. 
	<br>Patience is their powerful army: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">36</span>
	Not irritable or stuck up, 
	<br>dutiful in precepts and observances, 
	<br>tamed, bearing their final body: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">37</span>
	Like rain off a lotus leaf, 
	<br>like a mustard seed off the point of a pin, 
	<br>sensual pleasures slide off them: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">38</span>
	They understand for themselves 
	<br>in this life the end of suffering; 
	<br>with burden put down, detached: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">39</span>
	Deep in wisdom, intelligent, 
	<br>expert in the variety of paths; 
	<br>arrived at the highest goal: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">40</span>
	Socializing with neither 
	<br>householders nor the homeless. 
	<br>A migrant without a shelter, few in wishes: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">41</span>
	They’ve laid down the rod 
	<br>against creatures firm and frail; 
	<br>they don’t kill or cause to kill: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">42</span>
	Not fighting among those who fight, 
	<br>they’re extinguished among those who’ve taken up arms. 
	<br>Not grasping among those who grasp: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">43</span>
	They’ve discarded greed and hate, 
	<br>conceit and denigration, 
	<br>like a mustard seed off the point of a pin: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">44</span>
	The words they utter

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">45</span>
	They don’t steal anything in the world, 
	<br>long or short, 
	<br>fine or coarse, beautiful or ugly: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">46</span>
	They have no hope 
	<br>for this world or the next; 
	<br>free of hope, detached: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">47</span>
	They have no clinging, 
	<br>knowledge has freed them of indecision, 
	<br>they’ve arrived at the culmination of the deathless: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">48</span>
	They’ve escaped clinging 
	<br>to both good and bad deeds; 
	<br>sorrowless, stainless, pure:

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">49</span>
	Pure as the spotless moon, 
	<br>clear and undisturbed, 
	<br>they’ve ended desire to be reborn: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">50</span>
	They’ve got past this grueling swamp 
	<br>of delusion, transmigration. 
	<br>They’ve crossed over to the far shore, 
	<br>stilled and free of indecision. 
	<br>They’re extinguished by not grasping: 
	<br>that’s who I call a brahmin.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">51</span>
	They’ve given up sensual stimulations, 
	<br>and have gone forth from lay life; 
	<br>they’ve ended rebirth in the sensual realm:

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">52</span>
	They’ve given up craving,

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">53</span>
	They’ve given up human bonds,

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">54</span>
	They’ve given up liking and disliking,

	<br>a hero, master of the whole world:

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">55</span>
	They know the passing away

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">56</span>
	Gods, fairies, and humans

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">57</span>
	They have nothing before or after,
