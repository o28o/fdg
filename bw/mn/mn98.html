<div lang="en">

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n900"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.900] The text of this sutta has not been included in the PTS ed. of the Majjhima Nikāya, for the same reason given in <a href="mn92.html#n867">n.867.</a> The bracketed page numbers refer to the Anderson-Smith ed. of Sn.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was living at Icchānaṅgala, in the wood near Icchānaṅgala.</p>

<p>Now on that occasion a number of well-known, well-to-do brahmins were staying at Icchānaṅgala, that is, the brahmin Caṅkī, the brahmin Tārukkha, the brahmin Pokkharasāti, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi, the brahmin Todeyya, and other well-known, well-to-do brahmins.</p>

<p>Then, while the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were walking and wandering for exercise, this discussion arose between them: "How is one a brahmin?"</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>The brahmin student Bhāradvāja said: "When one is well born on both sides, of pure maternal and paternal descent seven generations back, unassailable and impeccable in respect of birth, then one is a brahmin." The brahmin student Vāseṭṭha said: "When one is virtuous and fulfils the observances, then one is a brahmin."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>But the brahmin student Bhāradvāja could not convince the brahmin student Vāseṭṭha, nor could the brahmin student Vāseṭṭha convince the brahmin student Bhāradvāja.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the brahmin student Vāseṭṭha addressed the brahmin student Bhāradvāja: "Sir, the recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, is living at Icchānaṅgala, in the wood near Icchānaṅgala. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to this effect: ‘That Blessed One is accomplished, fully enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of worlds, incomparable leader of persons to be tamed, teacher of gods and humans, enlightened, blessed.’ Come, Bh̄radvāja, let us go to the recluse Gotama and ask him about this matter. As he answers, so we will remember it." — "Yes, sir," the brahmin student Bhāradvāja replied.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then the two brahmin students, Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja, went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When this courteous and amiable talk was finished, they sat down at one side and the brahmin student Vāseṭṭha addressed the Blessed One in stanzas thus:</p>

<p>Vāseṭṭha</p>

<hr>
<p class="verse" id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"We are both acknowledged to possess
<br>The knowledge we claim of the Triple Veda,
<br>For I am Pokkharasāti's pupil
<br>And he a pupil of Tārukkha.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>We have attained full mastery
<br>Over all that the Vedic experts teach;
<br>Skilled in philology and grammar
<br>We match our teachers in recitation. 
A dispute has arisen between us, Gotama,
<br>Concerning the question of birth and class:</p>

<p class="verse" id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Bhāradvāja says one is a brahmin by birth,
<br>While I hold one is a brahmin by action.<span class="note" id="n901"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.901] Here the word "kamma" has to be understood as present action or deed, and not past action producing its present consequences.</span></span></span>
<br>Know this, O Seer, as our debate.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Since neither of us could convince the other,
<br>Or make him see his point of view,
<br>We have come to ask you, sir,
<br>Widely famed to be a Buddha.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>As people turn with palms upraised
<br>Towards the moon when it starts to wax,
<br>So in the world do they venerate you
<br>And pay homage to you, Gotama.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>So now we ask of you, Gotama,
<br>The eye uprisen in the world:
<br>Is one a brahmin by birth or action?
<br>Explain to us who do not know
<br>How we should recognise a brahmin."</p>

<p>Buddha</p>

<hr>
<p class="verse" id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"I teach you in order as they really are,
<br>Vāseṭṭha," said the Blessed One,
<br>"The generic divisions of living beings;
<br>For many are the kinds of birth.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Know first the grass and trees:

<br>Their birth is their distinctive mark;

<p class="verse" id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Then know the kinds of quadrupeds
<br><span class="add">Of varied sorts</span> both small and large:

<p class="verse" id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>Know those whose bellies are their feet,
<br>To wit, the long-backed class of snakes:
<br>Their birth is their distinctive mark;

<hr>
<p class="verse" id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>Know too the water-dwelling fish
<br>That pasture in the liquid world:
<br>Their birth is their distinctive mark;
<br>For many are the kinds of birth.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>Next know the birds that wing their way
<br>As they range in open skies:
<br>Their birth is their distinctive mark;
<br>For many are the kinds of birth.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"While in these births the differences
<br>Of birth make their distinctive mark,
<br>With humans no differences of birth
<br>Make a distinctive mark in them.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>Nor in the hairs nor in the head

<br>Nor in the fingers or the nails
<br>Nor in the knees nor in the thighs
<br>Nor in their colour or in voice:
<br>Here birth makes no distinctive mark
<br>As with the other kinds of birth.</p>

<p class="verse" id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>In human bodies in themselves
<br>Nothing distinctive can be found.
<br>Distinction among human beings
<br>Is purely verbal designation.<span class="note" id="n902"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.902] <i>Sāmaññā.</i> <a href="mn0-abbr.html">MA</a>: Among animals the diversity in the shape of their bodily parts is determined by their species <span class="add"><i>yoni</i></span>, but that <span class="add">species differentiation</span> is not found in the individual bodies of brahmins and other classes of humans. Such being the case, the distinction between brahmins, <i>khattiyas,</i> etc., is purely a verbal designation; it is spoken of as mere conventional expression.</span></span></span></p>
