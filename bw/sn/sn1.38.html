<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi Deer Park. Now on that occasion the Blessed One's foot had been cut by a stone splinter.<span class="note" id="n86"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.86] The Buddha’s foot had been injured when his evil cousin Devadatta tried to murder him by hurling a boulder at him on Mount Vulture Peak. The boulder was deflected, but a splinter that broke off from it cut the Buddha’s foot and drew blood. The full story of Devadatta's evil schemes is related at Vin II 184–203; see too Ñāṇamoli, <i>Life of the Buddha,</i> chap. 13. This same incident forms the background to <a href="sn4.13.html">SN4.13</a> below. According to <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>, the seven hundred devas who came to see the Blessed One included all the devas of the Satullapa host.</span></span></span> Severe pains assailed the Blessed One—bodily feelings that were painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable. But the Blessed One endured them, mindful and clearly comprehending, without becoming distressed. Then the Blessed One had his outer robe folded in four, and he lay down on his right side in the lion posture with one leg overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then, when the night had advanced, seven hundred devatas belonging to the Satullapa host, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Maddakucchi Deer Park, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.</p>

<p>Then one devata, standing to one side, uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One: <a class="pts_pn">sn.i.28</a> "The ascetic Gotama is indeed a nāga, sir! And when bodily feelings have arisen that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, through his nāga-like manner he endures them, mindful and clearly comprehending, without becoming distressed." <span class="note" id="n87"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.87] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: He is called a nāga on account of his strength (see n. <a href="sn1.30.html#n84">84</a>); a lion <i>(siha)</i> on account of his fearlessness; a thoroughbred <i>(ajaniya)</i> on account of his familiarity with what he has learned <i>(?byattaparicayaṭṭhena)</i>, or because he knows what is the right means and the wrong means; a chief bull <i>(nisabha)</i> because he is without a rival; a beast of burden <i>(dhorayha)</i> because of bearing the burden; tamed <i>(danta)</i> because he is free from deviant conduct. Spk glosses <i>nagavata</i> as <i>nagabhavena.</i> Geiger takes <i>nagavata</i> as the instrumental of the adjective <i>nagavant</i> used adverbially in the sense of a comparison (GermTr, p. 93). However, I follow Norman's suggestion (in a personal communication) that <i>-vata</i> here may be the Pali equivalent of Skt <i>-vrata,</i> in the sense of "sphere of action, function, mode or manner of life, vow" (MW). Ee2, based on a Lanna commentary, emends the text to read <i>nago va ta ca pan’ uppanna saririka vedanā</i> (and similarly in the parallel passages that follow); see Ee2, p. xviii. But I am doubtful that the text would switch so suddenly from metaphor (in the previous sentence) to simile, and then back to metaphor below.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then another devata uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One: "The ascetic Gotama is indeed a lion, sir! And when bodily feelings have arisen that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, through his leonine manner he endures them, mindful and clearly comprehending, without becoming distressed."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then another devata uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One: "The ascetic Gotama is indeed a thoroughbred, sir! And when bodily feelings have arisen that are painful … disagreeable, through his thoroughbred manner he endures them, mindful and clearly comprehending, without becoming distressed."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then another devata uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One: "The ascetic Gotama is indeed a chief bull, sir! And when bodily feelings have arisen that are painful … disagreeable, through his chief bull's manner he endures them, mindful and clearly comprehending, without becoming distressed."</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Then another devata uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One: "The ascetic Gotama is indeed a beast of burden, sir! And when bodily feelings have arisen that are painful … disagreeable, through his beast-of-burden's manner he endures them, mindful and clearly comprehending, without becoming distressed."</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then another devata uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One: "The ascetic Gotama is indeed tamed, sir! And when bodily feelings have arisen that are painful, racking, sharp, piercing, harrowing, disagreeable, through his tamed manner he endures them, mindful and clearly comprehending, without becoming distressed."</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Then another devata uttered this inspired utterance in the presence of the Blessed One: "See his concentration well developed and his mind well liberated—not bent forward and not bent back, and not blocked and checked by forceful suppression! <span class="note" id="n88"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.88] I read with Se: <i>Passa samādhiṁ subhavitaṁ cittañ ca suvimuttaṁ na cabhinataṁ na capanataṁ na ca sasaṅkhāraniggayhavaritavataṁ.</i> Be is identical except that the final word in the compound is read as <i>-gataṁ;</i> Ee1 <i>-caritavataṁ</i> is clearly an error, rectified in PED, s.v. <i>varitavata.</i> Ee2 reads as in Se, but with <i>niggayha</i> taken as uncompounded, which leaves <i>sasaṅkhar</i>a dangling. The same expression occurs elsewhere: at <a href="../an/an9.38.html">AN IV 428,9–10</a> the full formula is used to describe a samādhi called <i>aññaphala,</i> the fruit of final knowledge (or perhaps, "having final knowledge as its fruit"); <i>sasaṅkhāraniggayhavaritavata,</i> at <a href="../an/an3.101.html">AN I 254,34,</a> describes a samādhi developed as the basis for the six <i>abhiññā</i> (probably the fourth jhāna); and at <a href="../an/an5.27.html">AN III 24,9</a>, <a href="../dn/dn34.html">DN III 279,4,</a> and Vibh 334,15, it characterizes a "right concentration of fivefold knowledge" <i>(pañcañaṇika samma samādhi)</i>. In the present context, it seems, the expression qualifies cittaṁ, mind, though the mind has these qualities by virtue of the samādhi in which it is absorbed. At AN IV 428,9–10 and elsewhere the phrase clearly qualifies the samādhi. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> (Se): The concentration is that of the fruit of arahantship <i>(arahattaphalasamādhi)</i>. The mind is said to be well liberated <i>(suvimuttaṁ)</i> because it is liberated by the fruit. Not bent forward and not bent back: the mind accompanied by lust is said to be "bent forward" <i>(abhinataṁ)</i>, that accompanied by hate to be ʺbent backʺ <i>(apanataṁ)</i> . Rejecting both, he speaks thus. Not blocked and checked by forceful suppression: It is not blocked and checked, having suppressed the defilements forcefully, with effort; rather, it is checked because the defilements have been cut off. The meaning is that it is concentrated by the concentration of fruition <i>(na ca sasaṅkhāraniggayhavaritavatan ti na sasaṅkharena sappayogena kilese niggahetva varitavataṁ; kilesanaṁ pana chinnatta vataṁ, phalasamādhina samahitan ti attho)</i>. (N.B. While Spk (Be) reads <i>-gataṁ</i> in the lemma, it reads -vataṁ twice in the explanation.)</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p"><a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>-pṭ: This is not achieved, not fixed, forcefully, with effort, by way of abandoning in a particular respect or by way of abandoning through suppression as is the mundane-jhāna mind or insight; but rather (it is achieved) because the defilements have been completely cut off <i>(lokiyajjhanacittaṁviya vipassanā viya ca sasaṅkharena sappayogena tadaṅgappahana-vikkhambhanappahanavasena ca vikkhambhetva na adhigataṁ na ṭhapitaṁ, kiñcarahi kilesanaṁ sabbaso chinnataya)</i>.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">The Pali phrase is extremely difficult and the exact reading uncertain. Indeed, in the Central Asian Skt ms corresponding to <a href="../dn/dn34.html">DN III 279,4</a> (Waldschmidt, Sanskrittexte aus den Turfanfunden IV, p. 70, V.8 (3)), it is conspicuously absent. A Skt version in Śrav-bh (p. 444,19–21) reads varivad dhṛtaṁ, "maintained like water," which seems to me unlikely to correspond to the original reading.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">Ee1 puts a hiatus after <i>niggayha,</i> and Ee2 separates it off entirely; the other eds. integrate <i>niggayha</i> into the long compound. There is no way to determine, on the basis of grammar alone, which is correct. Each attempt to resolve the expression into its elements gives rise to its own special problems, and even the aṭṭhakathas and ṭikas offer conflicting explanations, e.g., Sv III 1060,11–13 and Vibh-a 421,13–15 take <i>niggayha</i> to be absolutive (as does <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>) and turn <i>varita</i> into the absolutive <i>varetva;</i> their respective ṭikas, Sv-pṭ III 284,24–27 (Be) and Vibh-mṭ 205,16–18 (Be), take <i>niggayha</i> as the gerundive <i>niggahetabba</i> and <i>varita</i> as the gerundive <i>varetabba.</i> Since <i>niggayha</i> occurs elsewhere unambiguously as an absolutive (e.g., at <a href="../mn/mn123.html">MN&nbsp;III 118,4,</a> interestingly, as here, without a direct object), while there seem to be no instances in canonical Pali of the word occurring as a gerundive, the aṭṭhakathas are more likely to be right. Norman questions this interpretation on the ground that there is no other known instance in Pali of an absolutive occurring as the second member of a compound (personal communication), but perhaps we should not rule out the possibility that we have such a construction here. I translate, however, in compliance with natural English idiom rather than in strict conformity with the syntax of the Pali.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">Readings of the last part of the compound vary among the different traditions: in general varitavata prevails in the Sinhalese tradition, <i>varitagata</i> in the Burmese,with Burmese vv.ll. <i>varivavata</i> and <i>varivavaṭa</i> also recorded. <i>Varita</i> here is a past participle of the causative <i>vareti,</i> to block, to restrain. The terminal member of the compound could then be either <i>vata</i> or <i>gata. Gata</i> is clearly a past participle. <i>Vata</i> is more problematic. At KS 1:39, <i>varitavataṁ</i> is rendered "having the habit of self-denial." Apparently C.Rh.D understands vata as equivalent to Skt <i>vrata.</i> However, <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>'s gloss, <i>chinnatta vataṁ phalasamādhina samahitaṁ,</i> suggests that we have a past participle here, and I would propose that <i>vata</i> represents Skt <i>vṛta,</i> which according to MW can mean "stopped, checked, held back." I cannot cite other occurrences of the simple participle vata in Pali, but prefixed forms are common enough: saṁvuta, nibbuta, vivaṭa, avaṭa, etc. Thus we would have here two past participles from the same root, one causative, the other simple, so that the compound <i>varitavata</i> would mean "blocked and checked" (unfortunately two distinct English verbs are needed to capture the nuances). Although this construction is certainly unusual, it need not be rejected out of hand, as it may have been used for special emphasis. If the reading <i>gata</i> is accepted, <i>varitagata</i> could mean "gone to (attained to) control," with <i>varita</i> taken as a noun of state. This certainly sounds more natural than <i>varitavata,</i> but the prevalence of vata in the textual tradition lends strong support to its authenticity.</span></span></span> If anyone would think such a one could be violated—such a nāga of a man, such a lion of a man, <a class="pts_pn">sn.i.29</a> such a thoroughbred of a man, such a chief bull of a man, such a beast of burden of a man, such a tamed man—what is that due to apart from lack of vision?"</p>

It is possible they were annexed to the prose text by the redactors of the canon.

Spk glosses <i>sataṁ samaṁ</i> as v<i>assasataṁ;</i> Geiger is certainly wrong in rejecting this explanation (GermTr, p. 41, n.&nbsp;3). Spk also glosses <i>hinattarūpa</i> as <i>hinattasabhava</i> and mentions a variant, <i>hinattharūpa,</i> glossed by Spk-pṭ as <i>hinatthajatika parihnattha,</i> ʺthose of low goals, those who have fallen away from the goal."</span></span></span></p>
