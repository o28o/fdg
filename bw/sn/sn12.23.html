<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At Sāvatthī.<span class="note" id="n67"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.67] For an essay based on this important sutta, see Bodhi, <i>Transcendental Dependent Arising.</i> The opening paragraph recurs at <a href="sn22.101.html">SN22.101</a>, but with a different sequel; see too n. <a href="sn12.21.html#n58">58</a>. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> states that the destruction of the taints <i>(āsavakkhaya)</i> is arahantship, which gains this name because it arises at the end of the destruction of the taints <i>(āsavānaṁ khayante jatatta)</i>.</span></span></span> "Bhikkhus, I say that the destruction of the taints is for one who knows and sees, not for one who does not know and does not see. For one who knows what, for one who sees what, does the destruction of the taints come about? ‘Such is form, such its origin, such its passing away; such is feeling … such is perception … such are volitional formations … such is consciousness, such its origin, such its passing away’: it is for one who knows thus, for one who sees thus, that the destruction of the taints comes about. <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.30</a></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"I say, bhikkhus, that the knowledge of destruction in regard to destruction has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for the knowledge of destruction? It should be said: liberation.<span class="note" id="n68"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.68] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Having set up the teaching with its climax in arahantship, the Buddha next shows the preliminary practice along which the arahant has travelled. The knowledge of destruction in regard to destruction <i>(khayasmiṁ khaye ñāṇaṁ)</i> is the reviewing knowledge <i>(paccavekkhaṇañāṇa)</i> which occurs when the destruction of the taints—namely, arahantship—has been obtained (see I, n. <a href="sn6.3.html#n376">376</a> and Vism 676; Ppn 22:19–21). Liberation is the liberation of the fruit of arahantship <i>(arahattaphalavimutti)</i>, which is a condition for reviewing knowledge by way of decisive-support condition <i>(upanissayapaccaya)</i>. First the fruit of arahantship arises, then the knowledge of destruction.

<br class="half">Spk glosses <i>sa-upanisā</i> as <i>sakāraṇa, sappacayya,</i> "with cause, with condition." Spk-pṭ adds: <i>upanisīdati phalaṁ ettha ti kāraṇaṁ upanīsa;</i> "the cause is called the proximate cause because the effect rests upon it." Thus the commentators take upanisā to be the equivalent of Skt upaniṣad, not a contraction of upanissaya. Although, as CPD points out, "a semantic blend" with the latter takes place, the two words must be kept distinct because not everything that is an <i>upanisā</i> (proximate cause) for other things is an <i>upanissayapaccaya</i> (decisive support condition) for those things. The latter refers solely to something which plays a strong causal role.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that liberation too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for liberation? It should be said: dispassion.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that dispassion too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for dispassion? It should be said: revulsion.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that revulsion too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for revulsion? It should be said: the knowledge and vision of things as they really are.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that the knowledge and vision of things as they really are too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for the knowledge and vision of things as they really are? It should be said: concentration.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that concentration too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>And what is the proximate cause for concentration? It should be said: happiness.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that happiness too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for happiness? It should be said: tranquillity.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that tranquillity too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for tranquillity? It should be said: rapture.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that rapture too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for rapture? It should be said: gladness.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that gladness too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for gladness? It should be said: faith.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that faith too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.31</a></p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>And what is the proximate cause for faith? It should be said: suffering.<span class="note" id="n69"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.69] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> glosses the terms in the above sequence thus (starting from the end): Suffering is the suffering of the round <i>(vaṭṭadukkha)</i>. Faith is repeatedly arising faith (<i>aparāparaṁ uppajjanasaddhā;</i> that is, tentative faith, not the unwavering faith of a noble disciple). Gladness <i>(pāmojja)</i> is weak rapture, while rapture proper <i>(pīti)</i> is strong rapture. Tranquillity <i>(passaddhi)</i> is the subsiding of distress, a condition for the happiness preliminary to absorption. Happiness is the happiness in the preliminary phase of meditative absorption, concentration the jhāna used as a basis (for insight; <i>pādakajjhanasamādhi</i>). Knowledge and vision of things as they really are <i>(yathābhūtañāṇadassana)</i> is weak insight, namely, the knowledges of the discernment of formations, of the overcoming of doubt, of exploration, and of what is and what is not the path (see Vism chaps. 18–20). Revulsion <i>(nibbidā)</i> is strong insight, namely, knowledge of appearance as fearful, of contemplation of danger, of reflection, and of equanimity about formations (Vism 645–57; Ppn 21:29–66). Dispassion <i>(virāga)</i> is the path, which arises expunging defilements.

<br class="half">Note that in the next paragraph suffering replaces aging-and-death of the usual formula.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that suffering too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for suffering? It should be said: birth.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that birth too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for birth? It should be said: existence.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that existence too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for existence? It should be said: clinging.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that clinging too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for clinging? It should be said: craving.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that craving too has a proximate cause; it does not lack a proximate cause.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>And what is the proximate cause for craving? It should be said: feeling.</p>

<p>"For feeling, it should be said: contact. For contact: the six sense bases. For the six sense bases: name-and-form. For name-and-form: consciousness. For consciousness: volitional formations.</p>

<p>"I say, bhikkhus, that volitional formations too have a proximate cause; they do not lack a proximate cause. And what is the proximate cause for volitional formations? It should be said: ignorance.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Thus, bhikkhus, with ignorance as proximate cause, volitional formations <span class="add">come to be</span>; with volitional formations as proximate cause, consciousness; with consciousness as proximate cause, name-and-form; with name-and-form as proximate cause, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as proximate cause, contact; with contact as proximate cause, feeling; with feeling as proximate cause, craving; with craving as proximate cause, clinging; with clinging as proximate cause, existence; with existence as proximate cause, birth; with birth as proximate cause, suffering; with suffering as proximate cause, faith; with faith as proximate cause, gladness; with gladness as proximate cause, rapture; with rapture as proximate cause, tranquillity; with tranquillity as proximate cause, happiness; with happiness as proximate cause, concentration; with concentration as proximate cause, the knowledge and vision of things as they really are; <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.32</a> with the knowledge and vision of things as they really are as proximate cause, revulsion; with revulsion as proximate cause, dispassion; with dispassion as proximate cause, liberation; with liberation as proximate cause, the knowledge of destruction.</p>
