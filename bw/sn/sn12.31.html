<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī. … There the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Sāriputta thus: "Sāriputta, in ‘The Questions of Ajita’ of the Parayana it is said:<span class="note" id="n87"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.87] The Parayana, the "Going to the Far Shore," is the last chapter of <a href="../snp/snp.html">Sn</a>. It consists of sixteen sections (plus prologue and epilogue), in each of which the Buddha replies to questions posed by one of sixteen brahmin students. "The Questions of Ajita" is the first of the sixteen sections.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>‘Those who have comprehended the Dhamma,
<br>And the manifold trainees here:
<br>Asked about their way of conduct,
<br>Being discreet, tell me, dear sir.’<span class="note" id="n88"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.88] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>-pṭ: Those who have comprehended the Dhamma <i>(saṅkhātadhamma)</i> are the arahants, who have penetrated the (four) truths. The trainees <i>(sekha)</i> are the seven types of persons—those on the four paths and the lower three fruits.

<br class="half"><i>Saṅkhātadhammā</i> could be understood to mean either "those who have comprehended the Dhamma," i.e., the teaching, or "those who have comprehended things," i.e., phenomena and their principles. Nidd II 34–35 (Be) glosses in both ways: as those who have known the Dhamma <i>(ñātadhamma)</i>, by knowing all formations as impermanent, etc.; and as those who have comprehended the aggregates, elements, sense bases, etc. The trainees <i>(sekhā)</i> are so called because they train in the higher virtue, the higher mind (the <i>jhānas</i>), and the higher wisdom. Though Norman says that Pj II and Nidd II do not take <i>sekhā</i> and <i>puthū</i> as going together (GD, p. 367, n. to 1038), read correctly both these texts do place the two words in apposition. The trainees are manifold <i>(puthū)</i> because they fall into the seven types.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>How should the meaning of this, stated in brief, be understood in detail?"</p>

He was not puzzled by the question but by the Buddha’s intention <i>(ajjhāsaya)</i>. For it was possible to answer in many ways—by way of the aggregates, elements, sense bases, or conditionality—and he wanted to catch the Teacher’s intention. Then the Teacher, aware of the reason for his silence, gave him the method with the words: “Do you see...?”</span></span></span><a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.48</a></p>

<p>"Venerable sir, one sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘This has come to be.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘This has come to be,’ one is practising for the purpose of revulsion towards what has come to be, for its fading away and cessation.<span class="note" id="n90"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.90] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: This has come to be <i>(bhūtam idaṁ)</i>: this is said of the five aggregates. Thus the Teacher gave the elder the method, implying, "Answer my question by way of the five aggregates." Then, just as the great ocean appears as one open expanse to a man standing on the shore, so as soon as he was given the method the answer to the question appeared to the elder with a hundred and a thousand methods. With correct wisdom <i>(sammā paññāya)</i>: one sees it with path-wisdom together with insight. One is practising: from the stage of virtue as far as the path of arahantship one is said to be practising for the purpose of revulsion, etc. This section shows the practice of the trainee.</span></span></span> One sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘Its origination occurs with that as nutriment.’<span class="note" id="n91"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.91] <i>Tadāhārasambhavaṁ.</i> On nutriment see <a href="sn12.11.html">SN12.11</a>, <a href="#12.12">12</a>and n. <a href="sn12.11.html#n18">18</a> above. No doubt it is the dependence of the five aggregates on nutriment that accounts for the inclusion of this sutta in the Nidanasaṁyutta. A similar treatment of nutriment, in catechism form, is at <a href="../mn/mn38.html">MN&nbsp;I 260,7–32</a>.

<br class="half">Spk resolves <i>tadāhārasambhavaṁ</i> as <i>taṁ āhārasambhavaṁ,</i> apparently taking tad to represent the five aggregates. I see the whole expression as qualifying an implicit subject ("its") and take <i>tad</i> ("that") as a specification of <i>āhāra.</i> Such an interpretation seems required by the parallel statement on cessation. See too the use of the expression <i>tadāhāra</i> at <a href="../sn/sn12.31.html#p8">SN&nbsp;II 85,6,</a> 86,12, 87,6, etc., which supports this interpretation.</span></span></span> Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘Its origination occurs with that as nutriment, ’ one is practising for the purpose of revulsion towards its origination through nutriment, for its fading away and cessation. One sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘With the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be is subject to cessation.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘With the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be is subject to cessation, ’ one is practising for the purpose of revulsion towards what is subject to cessation, for its fading away and cessation. It is in such a way that one is a trainee.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"And how, venerable sir, has one comprehended the Dhamma? Venerable sir, one sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘This has come to be.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘This has come to be,’ through revulsion towards what has come to be, through its fading away and cessation, one is liberated by nonclinging. One sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘Its origination occurs with that as nutriment.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘Its origination occurs with that as nutriment,’ through revulsion towards its origination through nutriment, through its fading away and cessation, one is liberated by nonclinging. One sees as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘With the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be is subject to cessation.’ Having seen as it really is with correct wisdom: ‘With the cessation of that nutriment, what has come to be is subject to cessation,’ through revulsion towards what is subject to cessation, through its fading away <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.49</a> and cessation, one is liberated by nonclinging.<span class="note" id="n92"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.921] Anupādā vimutto. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: One is liberated by not grasping anything at all with the four kinds of clinging <i>(upādāna)</i>. This section shows the arahant.</span></span></span> It is in such a way that one has comprehended the Dhamma.</p>
