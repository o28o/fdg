<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kurus, where there was a town of the Kurus named Kammasadamma. There the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Bhikkhus!"<span class="note" id="n183"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.183] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Why did he address the bhikkhus? Because a subtle Dhamma discourse, one stamped with the three characteristics, had presented itself to him. In this country (the Kuru country), it is said, the people had good roots (Spk-pṭ: supporting conditions for achievement of the noble Dhamma) and were wise (Spk-pṭ: with the wisdom of a three-rooted rebirth-consciousness and pragmatic wisdom). They were capable of penetrating a deep Dhamma talk stamped with the three characteristics. Therefore the Buddha taught here the two Satipaṭṭhāna Suttas (<a href="../dn/dn22.html">DN No. 22</a>, <a href="../mn/mn10.html">MN No. 10</a>), the Mahanidana Sutta (<a href="../dn/dn15.html">DN No. 15</a>), the Aneñjasappaya Sutta (<a href="../mn/mn106.html">MN No. 106</a>), the Cūḷanidana Sutta (<a href="sn12.60.html">SN12.60</a>), and other deep suttas.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Venerable sir!" those bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<hr>
<p>"Do you engage in inward exploration, bhikkhus?"<span class="note" id="n184"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.184] <i>Sammasatha no tumhe bhikkhave antaraṁ sammasan ti.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains "inward exploration" as internal exploration of conditions <i>(abbhantaraṁ paccayasammasanaṁ)</i>. In the exegetical literature, <i>sammasana-ñāṇa</i> is a technical term for the comprehension of the five aggregates by way of the three characteristics (see Paṭis I 53–54, quoted at Vism 607–8; Ppn 20:6–20). Here, however, <i>sammasana</i> is used in a sense that comes closer to the exegetical notion of <i>paccayapariggaha,</i> "discernment of conditions," as at Vism 598–600; Ppn 19:1–13.</span></span></span></p>

<p>When this was said, one bhikkhu said to the Blessed One: "Venerable sir, I engage in inward exploration."</p>

<p>"How do you engage in inward exploration, bhikkhu?"</p>

<p>The bhikkhu then explained but the way he explained did not satisfy the Blessed One.<span class="note" id="n185"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.185] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The Blessed One wanted him to answer by way of conditionality, but he could not grasp the Master's intention and answered by way of the thirty-two aspects (of bodily foulness).</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the Venerable Ānanda said: "Now is the time for this, Blessed One! Now is the time for this, Fortunate One! Let the Blessed One explain inward exploration. Having heard it from the Blessed One, the bhikkhus will remember it."</p>

<p>"Then listen and attend closely, Ānanda, I will speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," the bhikkhus replied. The Blessed One said this:</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Here, bhikkhus, when engaged in inward exploration, a bhikkhu explores thus: ‘The many diverse kinds of suffering that arise in the world <span class="add">headed by</span> aging-and-death: what is the source of this suffering, what is its origin, <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.108</a> from what is it born and produced? When what exists does aging-and-death come to be? When what does not exist does aging-and-death not come to be?’<span class="note" id="n186"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.186] As at <a href="sn12.51.html">SN12.51</a>, but with a different sequel. I read with <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Be</a> <i>idaṁ kho dukkhaṁ kiṁnidanaṁ.</i> Ee here is unsatisfactory.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"As he explores he understands thus: ‘The many diverse kinds of suffering that arise in the world <span class="add">headed by</span> aging-and-death: this suffering has acquisition as its source, acquisition as its origin; it is born and produced from acquisition.<span class="note" id="n187"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.187] <i>Idaṁ kho dukkhaṁ upadhinidānaṁ,</i> etc. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: It has its source in "acquisition as the aggregates" <i>(khandhupadhinidānaṁ)</i>; for here the five aggregates are intended by "acquisition." On <i>upadhi,</i> see I, n. <a href="sn1.12.html#n21">21</a>. The standard exegetical analysis of upadhi is fourfold: as defilements, aggregates, sensual pleasures, and volitional formations. As upadhi is conditioned by <i>taṇhā,</i> one might contend that here upadhi is synonymous with <i>upādāna.</i> Spk, however, does not endorse this interpretation, and the fact that <i>upadhi</i> is declared the basis for aging-and-death and the other types of suffering supports Spk's gloss <i>khandhupadhi.</i> Possibly a double meaning is intended: upadhi as the aggregates is the immediate condition for aging-and-death, while <i>upadhi</i> as equivalent to <i>upādāna</i> is the remote condition for existence and birth, which in turn is the remote condition for aging-and-death. On upadhi as the origin of suffering, see <a href="../snp/snp3.12.html#pyam">Sn p. 141,7–8</a>: <i>yaṁ kiñci dukkhaṁ sambhoti sabbaṁ upadhipaccayā.</i></span></span></span> When there is acquisition, aging-and-death comes to be; when there is no acquisition, aging-and-death does not come to be.’</p>

<p>"He understands aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading on that is in conformity with its cessation.<span class="note" id="n188"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.188] <i>Upadhinirodhasāruppagāminī paṭipadā.</i> As at <a href="sn12.51.html">SN12.51</a>; see n. <a href="sn12.51html#n135">135</a>.</span></span></span> He practises in that way and conducts himself accordingly. This is called a bhikkhu who is practising for the utterly complete destruction of suffering, for the cessation of aging-and-death.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Then, engaging further in inward exploration, he explores thus: ‘What is the source of this acquisition, what is its origin, from what is it born and produced? When what exists does acquisition come to be? When what is absent does acquisition not come to be?’</p>

<p>"As he explores he understands thus: ‘Acquisition has craving as its source, craving as its origin; it is born and produced from craving. When there is craving, acquisition comes to be; when there is no craving, acquisition does not come to be.’</p>

<p>"He understands acquisition, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading on that is in conformity with its cessation. He practises in that way and conducts himself accordingly. This is called a bhikkhu who is practising for the utterly complete destruction of suffering, for the cessation of acquisition.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Then, engaging further in inward exploration, he explores thus: ‘When this craving arises, where does it arise? When it settles down, upon what does it settle?’</p>

<p>"As he explores he understands thus: ‘Whatever in the world has a pleasant and agreeable nature: it is here that this craving arises when it arises; it is here that it settles when it settles down.’<span class="note" id="n189"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.189] For a more elaborate treatment, see the Mahasatipaṭṭhāna Sutta, <a href="../dn/dn22.html">DN II 308,6–309,11</a>.</span></span></span> And what in the world has a pleasant and agreeable nature? The eye has a pleasant and agreeable nature in the world: it is here that this craving arises when it arises; it is here that it settles when it settles down. So too the ear, <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.109</a> the nose, the tongue, the body, and the mind have a pleasant and agreeable nature: it is here that this craving arises when it arises; it is here that it settles when it settles down.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past regarded that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure: they nurtured craving. In nurturing craving they nurtured acquisition. In nurturing acquisition they nurtured suffering. In nurturing suffering they were not freed from birth, aging, and death; they were not freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they were not freed from suffering, I say.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future will regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure: they will nurture craving. In nurturing craving they will nurture acquisition. In nurturing acquisition they will nurture suffering. In nurturing suffering they will not be freed from birth, aging, and death; they will not be freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they will not be freed from suffering, I say.</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure: they are nurturing craving. In nurturing craving they are nurturing acquisition. In nurturing acquisition they are nurturing suffering. In nurturing suffering they are not freed from birth, aging, and death; they are not freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they are not freed from suffering, I say. <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.110</a></p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a bronze cup of a beverage having a fine colour, aroma, and taste, but it was mixed with poison. Then a man would come along, oppressed and afflicted by the heat, tired, parched, and thirsty. They would tell him: ‘Good man, this beverage in the bronze cup has a fine colour, aroma, and taste, but it is mixed with poison. Drink it if you wish. If you drink it, it will gratify you with its colour, aroma, and taste, but by drinking it you will meet death or deadly suffering.’ Suddenly, without reflecting, he would drink the beverage—he would not reject it—and thereby he would meet death or deadly suffering.<span class="note" id="n190"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.190] The same simile, but with slight differences in wording, is at <a href="../mn/mn46.html">MN&nbsp;I 316,10–23.</a></span></span></span></p>

<p>"So too, bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past … in the future … at present regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as permanent, as happiness, as self, as healthy, as secure: they are nurturing craving. In nurturing craving … they are not freed from suffering, I say.<span class="note" id="n191"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.191] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The bronze cup of beverage represents worldly objects of a pleasant and agreeable nature. The man oppressed by the heat represents the worldling attached to the round; the man who invites him to drink, the people who invite the worldling to enjoy objects in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature. The man in charge of the drink, who explains its virtues and dangers, is like a spiritual friend, one's preceptor, teacher, etc., who explains the gratification and danger in the five cords of sensual pleasure. Just as the man in the simile suddenly, without reflection, drinks the beverage and meets death or deadly suffering, so the worldling, eager to enjoy sensual pleasures, spurns the advice of his preceptor and teacher, gives up the training, and reverts to the lower life. There he commits a crime and is punished by the king, and in the next life he experiences great suffering in the four realms of misery.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past regarded that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as impermanent, as suffering, as nonself, as a disease, as fearful: they abandoned craving. In abandoning craving they abandoned acquisition. In abandoning acquisition they abandoned suffering. In abandoning suffering they were freed from birth, aging, and death; they were freed from sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair; they were freed from suffering, I say.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Whatever ascetics and brahmins in the future <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.111</a> will regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as impermanent, as suffering, as nonself, as a disease, as fearful: they will abandon craving.

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Whatever ascetics and brahmins at present regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as impermanent, as suffering, as nonself, as a disease, as fearful: they are abandoning craving.

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"Suppose, bhikkhus, there was a bronze cup of a beverage having a fine colour, aroma, and taste, but it was mixed with poison. Then a man would come along, oppressed and afflicted by the heat, tired, parched, and thirsty. They would tell him: ‘Good man, this beverage in the bronze cup has a fine colour, aroma, and taste, but it is mixed with poison. Drink it if you wish. If you drink it, it will gratify you with its colour, aroma, and taste, but by drinking it you will meet death or deadly suffering. ’ Then the man would think: ‘I can quench my thirst with water, whey, porridge, or soup, but I should not drink that beverage, since to do so would lead to my harm and suffering for a long time.’ Having reflected, he would not drink the beverage but would reject it, <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.112</a> and thereby he would not meet death or deadly suffering.</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"So too, bhikkhus, whatever ascetics and brahmins in the past … in the future … at present regard that in the world with a pleasant and agreeable nature as impermanent, as suffering, as nonself, as a disease, as fearful: they are abandoning craving.

When he reflects, rejects the beverage, and dispels his thirst with some other drink, this is like the bhikkhu's abiding by the advice of his preceptor and teacher, guarding the sense doors, gradually developing insight, and attaining the fruit of arahantship. The other four beverages are like the four paths. As the man dispels his thirst with the other four beverages and goes happily wherever he wants, so the arahant, having drunk of the four paths, dispels craving and goes to the region of Nibbāna.</span></span></span></p>
