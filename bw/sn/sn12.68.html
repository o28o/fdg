<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Venerable Musīla, the Venerable Saviṭṭha, the Venerable Nārada, and the Venerable Ānanda were living at Kosambı in Ghosita's Park.<span class="note" id="n197"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.197] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> does not identify these elders.

<p>Then the Venerable Saviṭṭha said to the Venerable Musīla: "Friend Musīla, apart from faith, apart from personal preference, apart from oral tradition, apart from reasoned reflection, apart from acceptance of a view after pondering it,<span class="note" id="n198"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.198] These five grounds for the acceptance of a thesis recur at <a href="sn35.153.html">SN35.153</a> and are examined critically by the Buddha at <a href="../mn/mn26.html">MN&nbsp;II 170,26-171,25</a>; see too <a href="../mn/mn101.html">MN&nbsp;II 218,15-21</a>. Here they are being contrasted with personal knowledge <i>(paccattameva ñāṇa)</i>. For a detailed discussion, see Jayatilleke, <i>Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge,</i> pp. 182-88, 274-76.

<br class="half"><a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: One person accepts something through faith <i>(saddhā)</i> by placing faith in another and accepting what he says as true. Another accepts something through personal preference <i>(ruci)</i> when he approves of some thesis by reflecting on it and then takes it to be true. One accepts a thesis by oral tradition <i>(anussava)</i> when one thinks: "This has come down from ancient times by oral tradition, so it must be true." For another, as he thinks, a certain thesis appears valid, and he concludes, "So it is": he accepts it by reasoned reflection <i>(ākārāparivitakka)</i>. (Jayatilleke discusses <i>ākārā</i> as meaning "reason" at p. 274.) In the fifth case, as one reflects, a view arises by pondering some hypothesis; this is acceptance of a view after pondering it <i>(diṭṭhinijjhānakkhanti)</i>.</span></span></span> does the Venerable Musīla have personal knowledge thus: ‘With birth as condition, aging-and-death <span class="add">comes to be</span>’?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7–12</span>Then the Venerable Nārada said to the Venerable Saviṭṭha: "Friend Saviṭṭha, it would be good if I were asked that series of questions.

It is said that he reflected thus: "This proposition—‘Nibbāna is the cessation of existence’—can be understood even by trainees. But this elder (Saviṭṭha) places that one (Musila) on the plane of the arahant. I will make him understand this matter correctly."</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Then let the Venerable Nārada get to answer that series of questions. I will ask the Venerable Nārada that series of questions, and let him answer me."</p>

<p><span class="add">Here the Venerable Saviṭṭha asks the Venerable Nārada the same series of questions as were addressed to the Venerable Musīla, and he answers in exactly the same way.</span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"Then the Venerable Nārada is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed." <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.118</a></p>

<p>"Friend, though I have clearly seen as it really is with correct wisdom, ‘Nibbāna is the cessation of existence,’ I am not an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed.<span class="note" id="n202"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.202] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Clearly seen … with correct wisdom: clearly seen with path wisdom together with insight. I am not an arahant: he indicates this because he stands on the path of nonreturning. But his knowledge that "Nibbāna is the cessation of existence" is a type of reviewing knowledge <i>(paccavekkhaṇañāṇa)</i> apart from the nineteen (regular) types of reviewing knowledge (see Vism 676; Ppn 22:19-21).</span></span></span> Suppose, friend, there was a well along a desert road, but it had neither a rope nor a bucket. Then a man would come along, oppressed and afflicted by the heat, tired, parched, and thirsty. He would look down into the well and the knowledge would occur to him, ‘There is water,’ but he would not be able to make bodily contact with it.<span class="note" id="n203"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.203] <i>Na ca kāyena phusitva vihareyya,</i> lit. "but he would not dwell having contacted it with the body." Spk glosses: "He would not be able to draw out the water."</span></span></span> So too, friend, though I have clearly seen as it really is with correct wisdom, ‘Nibbāna is the cessation of existence,’ I am not an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed."<span class="note" id="n204"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.204] Spk: The seeing of water in the well represents the seeing of Nibbāna by the nonreturner. The man afflicted by heat represents the nonreturner; the water bucket, the path of arahantship. As the man oppressed by heat sees water in the well, the nonreturner knows by reviewing knowledge, "There exists a breakthrough to the path of arahantship" (reading with Se <i>arahattaphalābhisamaya</i>). But as the man lacking the bucket cannot draw out the water and touch it with the body, so the nonreturner, lacking the path of arahantship, cannot sit down and become absorbed in the attainment of the fruit of arahantship, which has Nibbāna as its object.

<br class="half">It would be a misunderstanding of Nārada's reply to take it as a rejoinder to Musila's tacit claim that he is an arahant (the interpretation adopted by Gombrich, <i>How Buddhism Began,</i> pp. 128-29). The point is not that Musila was unjustified in consenting to that title, but that Saviṭṭha drew an incorrect inference, for he held the wrong belief that the defining mark of an arahant is the understanding of dependent origination and the nature of Nibbāna. This understanding, rather, is common property of the trainee and the arahant. What distinguishes the arahant from the trainee is not his insight into dependent origination (and other principles of the Dhamma) but the fact that he has used this insight to eradicate all defilements and has thereby gained access to a unique meditative state (called in the commentaries <i>arahattaphalasamāpatti,</i> the fruition attainment of arahantship) in which he can dwell "touching the deathless element with his body." At <a href="sn48.53.html">SN48.53</a>, too, the expression <i>kāyena phusitva vihārati</i> highlights the essential difference between the sekha and the asekha; see V, n. <a href="sn48.html#fn.V.238">238</a>. For parallel texts on the difference between the stream-enterer and the arahant, see <a href="sn22.html#22.109">22:109-110</a> (stated in terms of the five aggregates) and <a href="sn48.2.html">48:2-5</a>, <a href="sn48.26.html">26</a>-27, <a href="sn48.32.html">32</a>-33 (in terms of the faculties).</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>When this was said, the Venerable Ānanda asked the Venerable Saviṭṭha: "When he speaks in such a way, friend Saviṭṭha, what would you say about the Venerable Nārada?"</p>

<p>"When he speaks in such a way, friend Ānanda, I would not say anything about the Venerable Nārada except what is good and favourable."<span class="note" id="n205"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.205] In all three eds. the question begins with <i>evaṁvādī tvaṁ</i> and the reply with <i>evaṁvādāhaṁ.</i> However, since it was Nārada who just spoke, it seems we should read the question portion as <i>evaṁvādiṁ tvaṁ</i> and resolve <i>evaṁvādāhaṁ</i> in the reply into <i>evaṁvādiṁ ahaṁ.</i> Neither <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> nor Spk-pṭ offers any help here, but a note in Be of the text suggests this amendation. The Ee reading of a parallel passage at <a href="sn55.23.html">SN55.23</a> has the reading I prefer, though there Be and Se have the same reading as here. At <a href="../mn/mn101.html#p1">MN101</a> we find <i>evaṁvādāhaṁ</i> in a context where it would have to be resolved as an accusative plural, <i>evaṁvādino [nigaṇṭhe] ahaṁ,</i> which further supports my proposal regarding the present passage.</span></span></span></p>
