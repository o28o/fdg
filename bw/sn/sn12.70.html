<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary.</p>

<p>Now on that occasion the Blessed One was honoured, respected, esteemed, venerated, and revered, and he obtained robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites. The Bhikkhu Saṅgha too was honoured, respected, esteemed, venerated, and revered, and the bhikkhus too obtained robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites. But the wanderers of other sects were not honoured, respected, esteemed, venerated, and revered, and they did not obtain robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Now on that occasion the wanderer Susīma was residing in Rājagaha along with a large company of wanderers. <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.120</a> Then his company said to the wanderer Susīma: "Come, friend Susīma, lead the holy life under the ascetic Gotama. Master his Dhamma and teach it to us. We will master his Dhamma and preach it to the lay people. Thus we too will be honoured, respected, esteemed, venerated, and revered, and we too will obtain robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medicinal requisites."</p>

<p>"All right, friends," the wanderer Susīma replied. He then approached the Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to him: "Friend Ānanda, I wish to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and Discipline."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then the Venerable Ānanda took the wanderer Susīma and approached the Blessed One. He paid homage to the Blessed One, and then he sat down to one side and said to him: "Venerable sir, this wanderer Susīma says that he wishes to lead the holy life in this Dhamma and Discipline."</p>

<p>"Well then, Ānanda, give him the going forth." The wanderer Susīma then received the going forth and the higher ordination under the Blessed One.<span class="note" id="n206"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.206] This sutta is discussed in relation to its Chinese counterpart by Gombrich, <i>How Buddhism Began,</i> pp. 123–27.

<br class="half"><a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Susīma had approached the Venerable Ānanda, thinking, "He is the most learned disciple, and also the Teacher frequently reports to him the Dhamma he has spoken on various occasions; under him I will be able to learn the Dhamma quickly." Ānanda brought him to the Buddha because he knew that Susīma had been a teacher in his own right and he was apprehensive that after going forth he might try to bring discredit to the Dispensation. The Buddha understood that Susīma's motive in taking ordination was "theft of the Dhamma," which made his entry into the Dispensation impure, but he foresaw that Susīma would shortly undergo a change of heart and attain arahantship. Hence he instructed Ānanda to give him the going forth.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">It is puzzling that here, when it was most necessary to do so, the Buddha makes no mention of the probationary period normally imposed on wanderers of other sects who wish to enter the Buddhist order; perhaps the Buddha had foreseen that Susīma would have been discouraged by such a stipulation and would not have applied for admission, thus losing the chance to gain liberation.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Now on that occasion a number of bhikkhus had declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One, saying: "We understand: Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being." The Venerable Susīma heard about this, <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.121</a> so he approached those bhikkhus, exchanged greetings with them, and then sat down to one side and said to them: "Is it true that you venerable ones have declared final knowledge in the presence of the Blessed One, saying: ‘We understand: Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being’?"<span class="note" id="n207"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.207] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Those bhikkhus, having received a meditation subject from the Teacher, entered upon the three-month rains residence, and during the rains, striving and struggling, they attained arahantship. At the end of the rains they went to the Teacher and informed him of their attainment. When Susīma heard about this he thought: "Final knowledge <i>(aññā)</i> must be the supreme standard in this Dispensation, the essential personal transmission of the teacher (<i>paramappāmaṇaṁ sārabhūtā ācariyamuṭṭhi,</i> lit. ‘teacher's fist’). Let me inquire and find out about it." Therefore he approached those bhikkhus.

<br class="half">The stock description of the five abhiññās that follows is commented upon in detail in Vism, chaps. 12 and 13.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>"Yes, friend."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Then knowing and seeing thus, do you venerable ones wield the various kinds of spiritual power, such that: having been one, you become many; having been many, you become one; you appear and vanish; you go unhindered through a wall, through a rampart, through a mountain as though through space; you dive in and out of the earth as though it were water; you walk on water without sinking as though it were earth; seated cross-legged, you travel in space like a bird; with your hand you touch and stroke the moon and sun so powerful and mighty; you exercise mastery with the body as far as the brahma world?"</p>

<p>"No, friend."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Then knowing and seeing thus, do you venerable ones, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near?"</p>

<p>"No, friend."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"Then knowing and seeing thus, do you venerable ones understand the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with your own minds? Do you understand a mind with lust as a mind with lust; a mind without lust as a mind without lust; a mind with hatred as a mind with hatred; a mind without hatred as a mind without hatred; a mind with delusion <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.122</a> as a mind with delusion; a mind without delusion as a mind without delusion; a contracted mind as contracted and a distracted mind as distracted; an exalted mind as exalted and an unexalted mind as unexalted; a surpassable mind as surpassable and an unsurpassable mind as unsurpassable; a concentrated mind as concentrated and an unconcentrated mind as unconcentrated; a liberated mind as liberated and an unliberated mind as unliberated?"</p>

<p>"No, friend."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"Then knowing and seeing thus, do you venerable ones recollect your manifold past abodes, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion thus: ‘There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn elsewhere, and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life span; passing away from there, I was reborn here’? Do you thus recollect your manifold past abodes with their modes and details?"</p>

<p>"No, friend."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Then knowing and seeing thus, do you venerable ones, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understand how beings fare on in accordance with their kamma thus: ‘These beings who engaged in misconduct of body, <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.123</a> speech, and mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong view, and undertook actions based on wrong view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a state of misery, in a bad destination, in the nether world, in hell; but these beings who engaged in good conduct of body, speech, and mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right view, and undertook action based on right view, with the breakup of the body, after death, have been reborn in a good destination, in a heavenly world’? Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, do you see beings passing away and being reborn, inferior and superior, beautiful and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and understand how beings fare on in accordance with their kamma?"</p>

<p>"No, friend."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Then knowing and seeing thus, do you venerable ones dwell in those peaceful deliverances that transcend forms, the formless attainments, having touched them with the body?"<span class="note" id="n208"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.208] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>-pṭ: The formless jhānas and deliverance from perception <i>(āruppajjhāna-saññāvimokkha)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"No, friend."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"Here now, venerable ones: this answer and the nonattainment of those states, how could this be, friends?"<span class="note" id="n209"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.209] The text enclosed in brackets in Ee should be deleted and the question read as in Be and Se thus: <i>Ettha dāni āyasmanto idañ ca veyyākaraṇaṁ imesañ ca dhammānaṁ asamāpatti, idaṁ no āvuso kathan ti.</i> I take the no to be merely an interrogative particle <i>(= nu)</i>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"We are liberated by wisdom, friend Susīma."<span class="note" id="n210"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.210] Paññavimutta kho mayaṁ āvuso Susīma. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: He shows: "Friend, we are without jhāna, dry-insighters, liberated simply by wisdom" <i>(āvuso mayaṁ nijjhanaka sukkhavipassaka paññamatten’ eva vimutta)</i>. Spk-pṭ: Liberated simply by wisdom: not both-ways-liberated <i>(na ubhatobhagavimutta)</i>.

<br class="half">While Spk seems to be saying that those bhikkhus did not have any jhānas, the sutta itself establishes only that they lacked the <i>abhiññās</i> and āruppas; nothing is said about whether or not they had achieved the four jhānas. It is significant that Susīma's questions do not extend to the jhānas, and it is even possible (though contrary to the commentaries) that nijjhanaka should be understood, not as the deprivative "without jhāna," but as an agent noun from nijjhana, pondering, hence "ponderers." In any case, the sutta goes no further than to distinguish the paññavimutta arahant from other arahants who have the six abhiññās and the formless attainments, and thus it offers nothing radically different from the Nikāyas as a whole.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">The commentaries explain the paññavimutta arahant to be of five kinds: those who attain one or another of the four jhānas, and the "dry-insighter" <i>(sukkhavipassaka)</i> who lacks mundane jhāna but still has the supramundane jhāna inseparable from the noble path (see Sv II 512,19–28). On the contrast between <i>paññāvimutta</i> and <i>ubhatobhāgavimutta</i> arahants, see <a href="../mn/mn70.html">MN&nbsp;I 477–78</a>; Pp 14, 190–91.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"I do not understand in detail, friends, the meaning of what has been stated in brief by the venerable ones. It would be good if the venerable ones would explain to me in such a way that I could understand in detail what has been stated in brief." <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.124</a></p>

<p>"Whether or not you understand, friend Susīma, we are liberated by wisdom."</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Then the Venerable Susīma rose from his seat and approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and reported to the Blessed One the entire conversation he had had with those bhikkhus. <span class="add">The Blessed One said:</span></p>

<p>"First, Susīma, comes knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma, afterwards knowledge of Nibbāna."<span class="note" id="n211"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.211] <i>Pubbe kho Susīma dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇaṁ, pacchā nibbāne ñāṇaṁ.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Insight knowledge is "knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma," which arises first. At the end of the course of insight, path knowledge arises; that is "knowledge of Nibbāna," which arises later. Spk-pṭ: The "stability of the Dhamma" is the stableness of phenomena, their intrinsic nature <i>(dhammānaṁ ṭhitatā taṁsabhāvatā)</i>: namely, impermanence, suffering, nonself. Knowledge of that is "knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma." See too n. <a href="sn12.20html#n51">51</a>, and n. <a href="sn12.34.html#n105">105.</a> A chapter on <i>dhammaṭṭhitiñāṇa</i> is at Paṭis I 50–52, where it is explained as the knowledge of the relations between each pair of factors in <i>paṭicca-samuppāda.</i></span></span></span></p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"I do not understand in detail, venerable sir, the meaning of what was stated in brief by the Blessed One. It would be good if the Blessed One would explain to me in such a way that I could understand in detail what has been stated in brief."</p>

<p>"Whether or not you understand, Susīma, first comes knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma, afterwards knowledge of Nibbāna.<span class="note" id="n212"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.212] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Why is this said? For the purpose of showing the arising of knowledge thus even without concentration. This is what is meant: "Susīma, the path and fruit are not the issue of concentration <i>(samādhinissanda)</i>, nor the advantage brought about by concentration <i>(samādhi-ānisaṁsā)</i>, nor the outcome of concentration <i>(samādhinipphatti)</i>. They are the issue of insight <i>(vipassanā)</i>, the advantage brought about by insight, the outcome of insight. Therefore, whether you understand or not, first comes knowledge of the stability of the Dhamma, afterwards knowledge of Nibbāna."

<br class="half">Spk-pṭ: Even without concentration <i>(vinā pi samādhiṁ)</i>: even without previously established (concentration) that has acquired the characteristic of serenity <i>(samathalakkhaṇappattaṁ)</i>; this is said referring to one who takes the vehicle of insight <i>(vipassanāyānika)</i>.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">If understood on its own terms, the text establishes only that arahantship can be attained without the supernormal powers and the formless attainments. Read in the light of <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> and Spk-pṭ, it may be seen to affirm the existence of a "vehicle of bare insight" which begins directly with mindful contemplation of mental and physical phenomena, without depending on a base of concentration by means of the jhānas or access concentration <i>(upacārasamādhi)</i>. Though the suttas themselves say nothing about a system of bare insight meditation, some contemporary teachers regard the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta as propounding such a method and appeal to Spk and Spk-pṭ for additional support.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"What do you think, Susīma, is form permanent or impermanent?" –"Impermanent, venerable sir."<span class="note" id="n213"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.213] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Having known him to be capable of penetration, the Buddha speaks thus giving a Dhamma teaching with three turns, at the conclusion of which the elder attained arahantship.

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"Therefore, Susīma, any kind of form whatsoever, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near, all form should be seen as it really is with correct wisdom thus: ‘This is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self.’</p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"Seeing thus, Susīma, the instructed noble disciple experiences revulsion towards form, revulsion towards feeling, revulsion towards perception, revulsion towards volitional formations, revulsion towards consciousness. Experiencing revulsion, he becomes dispassionate. Through dispassion <span class="add">his mind</span> is liberated. When it is liberated there comes the knowledge: ‘It's liberated. ’ He understands: ‘Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being.’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"Do you see, Susīma: ‘With birth as condition, aging-and-death <span class="add">comes to be</span>’?"</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"Knowing and seeing thus, Susīma, do you wield the various kinds of spiritual power, such that: having been one, you become many … and exercise bodily mastery as far as the brahma world?"<span class="note" id="n214"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.214] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: This query is started in order to make it evident that those bhikkhus were dry-insighters without jhāna (or: "dry-insight ponderers").

<hr>
<p>"No, venerable sir."</p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"Then knowing and seeing thus, Susīma, do you, with the divine ear element, which is purified and surpasses the human, hear both kinds of sounds, the divine and human, those that are far as well as near?" <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.127</a></p>

<hr>
<p>"No, venerable sir."</p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>"Then knowing and seeing thus, Susīma, do you understand the minds of other beings and persons, having encompassed them with your own mind?"</p>

Venerable sir, may the Blessed One pardon me for my transgression seen as a transgression for the sake of future restraint."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>"Surely, Susīma, you have committed a transgression in that you were so foolish, so confused, so inept that you went forth as a thief of the Dhamma in such a well-expounded Dhamma and Discipline as this.<span class="note" id="n215"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.215] <i>Dhammatthenaka.</i> The formula for confession and pardon is also at <a href="sn16.6.html">SN16.6</a> (II 205,10–16).</span></span></span> <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.128</a> Suppose, Susīma, they were to arrest a bandit, a criminal, and bring him before the king, saying: ‘Sire, this man is a bandit, a criminal. Impose on him whatever punishment you wish.’ The king would say to them: ‘Come, men, bind this man's arms tightly behind his back with a strong rope, shave his head, and lead him around from street to street and from square to square, beating a drum. Then take him out through the southern gate and to the south of the city cut off his head.’ What do you think, Susīma, would that man experience pain and displeasure on that account?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Yes, venerable sir."</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>"Although that man would experience pain and displeasure on that account, going forth as a thief of the Dhamma in such a well-expounded Dhamma and Discipline as this has results that are far more painful, far more bitter, and further, it leads to the nether world. But since you see your transgression as a transgression and make amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, we pardon you for it. For it is growth in the Noble One's Discipline when one sees one's transgression as a transgression, makes amends for it in accordance with the Dhamma, and undertakes future restraint." <a class="pts_pn">sn.ii.129</a></p>
