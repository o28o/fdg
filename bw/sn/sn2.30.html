<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the Squirrel Sanctuary. Then, when the night had advanced, a number of young devas, disciples of various sectarian teachers—Asama and Sahali and Ninka and Akoṭaka and Vetambari and Maṇavagamiya—of stunning beauty, <a class="pts_pn">sn.i.66</a> illuminating the entire Bamboo Grove, approached the Blessed One. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and stood to one side.<span class="note" id="n190"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.190] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: "These young devas were proponents of kamma; therefore they performed meritorious deeds and were reborn in heaven. Thinking that they had been reborn there on account of their confidence in their respective teachers, they came to the Buddha in order to recite verses in praise of those teachers." Both Pūraṇa Kassapa and Makkhali Gosāla advocated doctrines that were opposed to the Buddhist teaching on kamma; their teachings are classified among the views that normally lead to a bad rebirth.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then, standing to one side, the young deva Asama spoke this verse referring to Pūraṇa Kassapa in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p2"><span class="parno" id="v365">2</span><span class="add">v.365</span> "In injuring and killing here,
<br>In beating and extortion,
<br>Kassapa did not recognize evil
<br>Nor see any merit for oneself.
<br>He indeed taught what is worthy of trust:
<br>That teacher deserves esteem."<span class="note" id="n191"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.191] The verse is a concise statement of Pūraṇa Kassapa's doctrine of nonaction <i>(akiriyavada)</i>, for which see <a href="../dn/dn2.html">DN I 52,22–53,4</a> and <a href="sn24.6.html">SN24.6</a> (in the latter source no ascription of the view to a teacher is made). A detailed account of the teachings of the six "heretical teachers" (of whom four are mentioned here and all six just below at <a href="sn3.1.html">SN3.1</a>) can be found in the Samaññaphala Sutta, <a href="../dn/dn2.html">DN No. 2</a>; for a translation with commentary, see Bodhi, <i>The Discourse on the Fruits of Recluseship,</i> esp. pp. 6–9, 19–26, 69–86. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> paraphrases: "In declaring that there is no result of evil or merit, he taught to beings what is trustworthy as the foundation, the support; therefore he deserves esteem, veneration, worship."</span></span></span></p>
</div>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then the young deva Sahali spoke this verse referring to Makkhali Gosāla in the presence of the Blessed One:<span class="note" id="n192"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.192] Makkhali Gosāla was the founder and leader of the sect of ascetics known as the ājīvikas. For his doctrine of non-causality (<i>ahetukavāda</i>), also called “purification by wandering on” (<i>saṁsārasuddhi</i>), see <a href="../dn/dn2.html">DN I 53,25–54,21</a> and <a href="sn24.7.html">24:7</a>. A full account of his life and teachings can be found in Basham, <i>History and Doctrines of the ājīvikas.</i></span></span></span></p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p4"><span class="parno" id="v366">4</span><span class="add">v.366</span> "By austerity and scrupulousness
<br>He attained complete self-restraint.
<br>He abandoned contentious talk with people,
<br>Refrained from falsehood, a speaker of truth.
<br>Surely such a one does no evil."<span class="note" id="n193"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.193] The verse alludes to Makkhali's style of ascetic practice but, strangely, makes no mention of his doctrines. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains his austerity <i>(tapa)</i> as bodily mortification and his scrupulousness <i>(jiguccha)</i> as the loathing of evil (Spk-pṭ: the undertaking of the vow of nudity, etc., in the belief that this is the way to eliminate evil). This explanation shows that Spk regards <i>tapojiguccha</i> here as a collective <i>dvanda</i> compound, "austerity and scrupulousness," and so I have rendered it. Sv III 834,37, however, commenting on <a href="../dn/dn25.html">DN III 40,13–52,22</a> (where the Buddha gives a long disquisition on how <i>tapojiguccha</i> is imperfect and perfect — <i>aparipuṇṇa, paripuṇṇa</i>), explains the compound as a <i>tappurisa</i> meaning "scrupulousness by austerity": <i>Tapojiguccha ti viriyena papajiguccha papavivajjana;</i> "Austerity-scrupulousness: scrupulousness in regard to evil, the avoidance of evil, by means of energy." <i>Tapassi</i> and <i>jegucchi</i> (the corresponding nouns of personal reference) are used to designate separate factors of the Bodhisatta's "fourfold holy life" practised before his enlightenment at <a href="../mn/mn12.html">MN&nbsp;I 77,23–27 and 78,32–36</a>. See too Basham, pp. 109–15, for a description of Ajīvika asceticism.</span></span></span></p>
</div>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then the young deva Ninka spoke this verse referring to Nigaṇṭha Nataputta in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p6"><span class="parno" id="v367">6</span><span class="add">v.367</span> "A scrupulous discerning bhikkhu,
<br>Well restrained by the four controls,
<br>Explaining what is seen and heard:
<br>Surely, he could not be a sinner."<span class="note" id="n194"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.194] Nigaṇṭha Nataputta is identical with Mahavīra, the historical progenitor of Jainism. His discipline of restraint by the four controls <i>(catuyamasaṁvara)</i> is described at <a href="../dn/dn2.html">DN I 57,25–27</a> and <a href="../mn/mn56.html">MN&nbsp;I 377,1–2.</a> At MLDB, p. 482, the formula is translated: "(he is) curbed by all curbs, clamped by all curbs, cleansed by all curbs, and claimed by all curbs." It is questionable whether either the text or its commentary (Sv I 168–69, Ps III 58–59) represents a genuine Jaina tradition.</span></span></span></p>
</div>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Then the young deva Akoṭaka spoke this verse referring to various sectarian teachers in the presence of the Blessed One:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p8"><span class="parno" id="v368">8</span><span class="add">v.368</span> "Pakudhaka Katiyana and the Nigaṇṭha,
<br>Along with Makkhali and Pūraṇa:
<br>Teachers of companies, attained to ascetic stature:
<br>They were surely not far from superior men."<span class="note" id="n195"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.195] Pakudhaka Katiyana is an alternative spelling of Pakudha Kaccāyana, whose doctrine of the seven bodies <i>(sattakaya)</i> is described at <a href="../dn/dn2.html">DN I 56,21–57,34</a> and at <a href="sn24.8.html">SN24.8</a>. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> says that the statement that "they were not far from superior men" means, in effect, that they were superior men <i>(sappurisa)</i>, i.e., ariyans or noble ones.</span></span></span></p>
</div>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Then the young deva Vetambari replied to the young deva Akoṭaka in verse:</p>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p10"><span class="parno" id="v369">10</span><span class="add">v.369</span> "Even by howling along the wretched jackal
<br>Remains a vile beast, never the lion's peer.
<br>So though he be the teacher of a group,
<br>The naked ascetic, speaker of falsehood,
<br>Arousing suspicion by his conduct,
<br>Bears no resemblance to superior men."<span class="note" id="n196"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.196] in pāda a, Be and Se read <i>sahacaritena;</i> Ee1 reads <i>sagaravena,</i> corrected in Ee2 to <i>sāhāravena,</i> "along with (his) howling." <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>-pṭ supports this: "By merely making a howl along with the roar of the lion; that is, the jackal (is not the lion's equal) merely by making a jackal's howl at the same time that the lion makes its lion's roar." The jackal and the lion form a classical pair of opposites in ancient Indian literature; see Ja Nos. 143 and 335, where a jackal does himself to death trying to emulate the lion's prowess in hunting, and especially Ja No. 172, where a jackal shames a group of young lions to silence by trying to imitate their roar.</span></span></span> <a class="pts_pn">sn.i.67</a></p>
</div>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Then Māra the Evil One took possession of the young deva Vetambari and recited this verse in the presence of the Blessed One:<span class="note" id="n197"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.197] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Māra thought: “He has spoken dispraise of the other teachers. I will make him speak praise of them through his own mouth.”</span></span></span></p>

<br>In regard to the other world."</p>
</div>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Then the Blessed One, having understood, "This is Māra the Evil One," replied to Māra the Evil One in verse:</p>

<br>All these, indeed, you praise, Namuci,
<br>Like bait thrown out for catching fish."<span class="note" id="n198"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.198] Namuci is a name of Māra, which <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>-pṭ (to <a href="sn4.1.html">SN4.1</a>) explains as meaning "he does not free" <i>(na muci: vaṭṭadukkhato aparimuttapaccayatta namuci);</i> "He is called Namuci because he does not let one get free from the suffering of the round." Spk paraphrases the Buddha’s remark: "Just as a fisherman throws out bait at the end of a hook for the purpose of catching fish, so, by praising these forms, you throw them out in order to catch living beings." See <a href="sn35.230.html">SN35.230</a>.</span></span></span></p>
</div>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>Then, in the Blessed One's presence, the young deva Maṇavagamiya recited these verses referring to the Blessed One:</p>
