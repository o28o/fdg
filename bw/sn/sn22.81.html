<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Kosambi in Ghosita's Park.</p>

<p>Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, entered Kosambi for alms. When he had walked for alms in Kosambi and had returned from the alms round, after his meal <a class="pts_pn">sn.iii.95</a> he set his lodging in order himself, took his bowl and robe, and without informing his personal attendants, without taking leave of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha, he set out on tour alone, without a companion.<span class="note" id="n128"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.128] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> assigns this sutta to the time of the famous quarrel at Kosambi. After he had failed in three attempts to reconcile the factious parties, the Buddha decided to set out alone. For a full account, see Vin I 337–57 and Ñāṇamoli, Life of the Buddha, pp. 109–19.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then, not long after the Blessed One had departed, a certain bhikkhu approached the Venerable Ānanda and told him: "Friend Ānanda, the Blessed One has set his lodging in order himself, taken his bowl and robe, and without informing his personal attendants, without taking leave of the Bhikkhu Saṅgha, he has set out on tour alone, without a companion."</p>

<p>"Friend, whenever the Blessed One sets out like that he wishes to dwell alone. On such an occasion the Blessed One should not be followed by anyone."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then the Blessed One, wandering by stages, arrived at Parileyyaka. There at Parileyyaka the Blessed One dwelt at the foot of an auspicious sal tree.<span class="note" id="n129"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.129] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The residents of Pārileyyaka built a leaf hall for the Blessed One in a protected grove near their town. An auspicious <i>(bhadda)</i> sal tree grew there. While living in dependence on the town, the Blessed One dwelt at the foot of the tree near the leaf hut in the grove. Spk relates here the story of the bull elephant who came to wait upon the Buddha; see <a href="../ud/ud41.html">Ud&nbsp;41</a>–<a href="../ud/ud42.html">42</a> and Vin I 352–53.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then a number of bhikkhus approached the Venerable Ānanda and exchanged greetings with him.<span class="note" id="n130"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.130] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: These were not the factious bhikkhus, but five hundred other monks who had come from various quarters after the rains.</span></span></span> When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to the Venerable Ānanda: "Friend Ānanda, it has been a long time since we heard a Dhamma talk in the presence of the Blessed One. We should like to hear such a talk, friend Ānanda."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then the Venerable Ānanda together with those bhikkhus approached the Blessed One at Parileyyaka, at the foot of the auspicious sal tree. Having approached, they paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down to one side. The Blessed One then instructed, exhorted, inspired, and gladdened those bhikkhus with a Dhamma talk. <a class="pts_pn">sn.iii.96</a> Now on that occasion a reflection arose in the mind of a certain bhikkhu thus: "How should one know, how should one see, for the immediate destruction of the taints to occur?"<span class="note" id="n131"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.131] See <b><a href="sn22.55.html">SN22.55</a></b>. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains this as referring to "the fruit of arahantship immediately following the path" <i>(maggānantaraṁ arahattaphalaṁ)</i>. However, as in the commentarial system the fruit inevitably occurs in immediate succession to the path, I think the monk is really asking how to attain arahantship swiftly and directly, without being detained at any lower stage of awakening.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The Blessed One, having known with his own mind the reflection in that bhikkhu's mind, addressed the bhikkhus thus:</p>

<p>"Bhikkhus, this Dhamma has been taught by me discriminately. <span class="note" id="n132"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.132] <i>Vicayaso.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> glosses with <i>vicayena</i> and explains: "Having delimited with knowledge that is capable of discriminating the real nature of the various phenomena." What follows are the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment <i>(bodhipakkhiyā dhammā)</i>.</span></span></span> The four establishments of mindfulness have been taught by me discriminately. The four right strivings … The four bases for spiritual power … The five spiritual faculties … The five powers … The seven factors of enlightenment … The Noble Eightfold Path has been taught by me discriminately. Bhikkhus, in regard to the Dhamma that has been thus taught by me discriminately, a reflection arose in the mind of a certain bhikkhu thus: ‘How should one know, how should one see, for the immediate destruction of the taints to occur?’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"And how, bhikkhus, should one know, how should one see, for the immediate destruction of the taints to occur? Here, bhikkhus, the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self. That regarding, bhikkhus, is a formation.<span class="note" id="n133"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.133] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> glosses "that regarding" <i>(sā sasamanupassanā)</i> as a "viewformation" <i>(diṭṭhi-saṅkhāra)</i>. I understand <i>saṅkhāra</i> here as meaning what is conditioned rather than the active power of generation, i.e., as the <i>saṅkhata-saṅkhāra</i> of the commentaries rather than as <i>abhisaṅkhāraṇa-saṅkhāra,</i> the act of volitional formation. The point, it seems, is that by calling the act of regarding a "formation," the Buddha underlines its conditioned origination. This in turn highlights its impermanence, recognition of which knocks away the adherence to the very notion "I am," thus culminating in arahantship. On “ignorance-contact” <i>(avijjāsamphassa),</i> see n. <a href="sn12.22.html#n63">63</a>.</span></span></span> That formation—what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born and produced? When the uninstructed worldling is contacted by a feeling born of ignorance-contact, craving arises: thence that formation is born.</p>

<p>"Thus, bhikkhus, that formation is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen; that craving is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen; that feeling is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen; that contact is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen; that ignorance is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. <a class="pts_pn">sn.iii.97</a> When one knows and sees thus, bhikkhus, the immediate destruction of the taints occurs.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"He may not regard form as self, but he regards self as possessing form. That regarding is a formation … <span class="add">all as above</span> … When one knows and sees thus, bhikkhus, the immediate destruction of the taints occurs.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"He may not regard form as self or self as possessing form, but he regards form as in self. That regarding is a formation … .</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"He may not regard form as self or self as possessing form or form as in self, but he regards self as in form. That regarding is a formation … . <a class="pts_pn">sn.iii.98</a></p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"He may not regard form as self … or self as in form, but he regards feeling as self … perception as self … volitional formations as self … consciousness as self … self as in consciousness. That regarding is a formation … . When one knows and sees thus, bhikkhus, the immediate destruction of the taints occurs.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"He may not regard form as self … <a class="pts_pn">sn.iii.99</a> … or self as in consciousness, but he holds such a view as this: ‘That which is the self is the world; having passed away, that I shall be—permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change.’<span class="note" id="n134"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.134] This view, which posits the identity of the self and the world <i>(so attā so loko)</i>, seems to be derived from the Upaniṣads. Strangely, <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> passes over this view in silence, and Ps (commenting on <a href="../mn/mn22.html">MN&nbsp;I 135,37</a>) offers only an unilluminating word gloss. For a discussion, see Wijesekera, "An Aspect of Upaniṣadic Atman and Buddhist ‘Anatta,’" <i>Buddhist and Vedic Studies,</i> pp. 261–63.</span></span></span> That eternalist view is a formation … . When one knows and sees thus, bhikkhus, the immediate destruction of the taints occurs.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"He may not regard form as self … or hold such an <span class="add">eternalist</span> view, but he holds such a view as this: ‘I might not be, and it might not be for me; I will not be, <span class="add">and</span> it will not be for me.’<span class="note" id="n135"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.135] Here I read with Se and Ee: <i>no c’ assaṁ no ca me siyā, na bhavissāmi na me bhavissati.</i> Be reads the third negated verb as <i>nabhavissaṁ.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: "If I were not, neither would there be my belongings; if I will not be in the future, neither will there be my belongings." For a fuller discussion, see n. <a href="sn22.35.html#n75">75</a>.</span></span></span> That annihilationist view is a formation … .</p>

<hr>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"He may not regard form as self … or hold such an <span class="add">annihilationist</span> view, but he is perplexed, doubtful, indecisive in regard to the true Dhamma. That perplexity, doubtfulness, indecisive-ness in regard to the true Dhamma is a formation. That formation—what is its source, what is its origin, from what is it born and produced? When the uninstructed worldling is contacted by a feeling born of ignorance-contact, craving arises: thence that formation is born.<span class="note" id="n136"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.136] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Even though doubt <i>(vicikicchā)</i> does not exist in the cittas associated with craving, the doubt-formation arises from it because craving has not been abandoned. For doubt arises in one who has not abandoned craving.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"So that formation, bhikkhus, is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen; that craving is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen; that feeling is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen; that contact is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen; that ignorance is impermanent, conditioned, dependently arisen. When one knows and sees thus, bhikkhus, the immediate destruction of the taints occurs."<span class="note" id="n137"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.137] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: In this sutta, in twenty-three cases, insight culminating in arahantship has been explained.</span></span></span> <a class="pts_pn">sn.iii.100</a></p>
