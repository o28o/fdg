<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Venerable Sāriputta was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now on that occasion the following pernicious view had arisen in a bhikkhu named Yamaka: "As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death."<span class="note" id="n151"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.151] His position is not quite the same as that of the common annihilationist, since he does not hold that all beings are annihilated at death. He seems to hold an eternalist view in regard to unenlightened beings (since they have a lasting self which transmigrates) and annihilationism in regard to the arahant (since he utterly perishes at death).

<br class="half"><a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: If he had thought, "Formations arise and cease; a simple process of formations reaches nonoccurrence," this would not be a view <i>(diṭṭhigata)</i> but knowledge in accordance with the Teaching. But since he thought, "A being is annihilated and destroyed," this becomes a view. What follows is paralleled by <a href="../mn/mn22.html">MN&nbsp;I 130–31</a> and <a href="../mn/mn38.html">I 256–57</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>A number of bhikkhus heard that such a pernicious view had arisen in the bhikkhu Yamaka. Then they approached the Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him, after which they sat down to one side and said to him: "Is it true, friend Yamaka, that such a pernicious view as this has arisen in you: <a class="pts_pn">sn.iii.110</a> ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death’?"</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Exactly so, friends. As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Friend Yamaka, do not speak thus. Do not misrepresent the Blessed One. It is not good to misrepresent the Blessed One. The Blessed One would not speak thus: ‘A bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death.’"</p>

<p>Yet, although he was admonished by the bhikkhus in this way, the Venerable Yamaka still obstinately grasped that pernicious view, adhered to it, and declared: "As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Since those bhikkhus were unable to detach the Venerable Yamaka from that pernicious view, they rose from their seats, approached the Venerable Sāriputta, and told him all that had occurred, adding: "It would be good if the Venerable Sāriputta would approach the bhikkhu Yamaka out of compassion for him." The Venerable Sāriputta consented by silence.</p>

<p>Then, in the evening, the Venerable Sāriputta emerged from seclusion. He approached the Venerable Yamaka and exchanged greetings with him, after which he sat down to one side and said to him:</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Is it true, friend Yamaka, that such a pernicious view as this has arisen in you: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, <a class="pts_pn">sn.iii.111</a> a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death’?"</p>

<p>"Exactly so, friend."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"What do you think, friend Yamaka, is form permanent or impermanent?" - "Impermanent, friend." … - "Therefore … Seeing thus … He understands: ‘ … there is no more for this state of being.’<span class="note" id="n152"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.152] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: At the end of this teaching on the three characteristics Yamaka became a stream-enterer. Sāriputta asks the following questions to examine him and to get him to show that he has given up his wrong view.

<br class="half">Spk glosses <i>Tathāgata</i> here as "a being" <i>(satta)</i>, which I think does not quite hit the mark. I take the subject of the discussion to be, not a being in general, but the arahant conceived as a being, as a substantial self. Thus the catechism will show that Yamaka has abandoned his identity view <i>(sakkāyadiṭṭhi)</i> regarding the arahant, and therewith his view of the arahant as a self that undergoes annihilation. We find a similar transition from the arahant <i>(vimuttacitta bhikkhu)</i> to the Tathāgata at <a href="../mn/mn22.html">MN&nbsp;I 140,3–7</a> and <a href="../mn/mn72.html">I 486–88</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard form as the Tathāgata?" - "No, friend." - "Do you regard feeling … perception … volitional formations … consciousness as the Tathāgata?" - "No, friend."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard the Tathāgata as in form?" - "No, friend." - "Do you regard the Tathāgata as apart from form?" - "No, friend." - "Do you regard the Tathāgata as in feeling? As apart from feeling? As in perception? As apart from perception? As in volitional formations? As apart from volitional formations? As in consciousness? As apart from consciousness?" - "No, friend."</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard form, feeling, perception, volitional formations, and consciousness <span class="add">taken together</span> as the Tathāgata?" - "No, friend." <a class="pts_pn">sn.iii.112</a></p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"What do you think, friend Yamaka, do you regard the Tathāgata as one who is without form, without feeling, without perception, without volitional formations, without consciousness?" - "No, friend."<span class="note" id="n153"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.153] The first three alternatives—conceiving the aggregates individually as the Tathāgata, the Tathāgata as within the aggregates, and the Tathāgata as apart from the aggregates—correspond to the first three modes of conceiving in the Mūlapariyaya Sutta (<a href="../mn/mn1.html">MN&nbsp;I 1</a>), which are set in relation to the sense bases at <a href="sn35.30.html">SN35.30</a>, <a href="sn35.31.html">31</a>. The fourth position conceives the aggregates collectively as the Tathāgata (perhaps a view of supervenience); the fifth conceives the Tathāgata as entirely transcendent, without any essential relation to the aggregates. These modes of conceiving can also be correlated with the twenty types of identity view.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"But, friend, when the Tathāgata is not apprehended by you as real and actual here in this very life,<span class="note" id="n154"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.154] <i>Diṭṭh’ eva dhamme saccato thetato tathāgato anupalabbhiyamāno.</i> Cp. <a href="../mn/mn22.html">MN&nbsp;I 138,5–6</a>: <i>Attani ca bhikkhave attaniye ca saccato thetato anupalabbhamāne.</i> <a href="../mn/mn22.html">MN&nbsp;I 140,6–7</a>: <i>Diṭṭh’ evāhaṃ bhikkhave dhamme tathāgataṃ ananuvejjo ti vadāmi.</i></span></span></span> is it fitting for you to declare: ‘As I understand the Dhamma taught by the Blessed One, a bhikkhu whose taints are destroyed is annihilated and perishes with the breakup of the body and does not exist after death’?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"Formerly, friend Sāriputta, when I was ignorant, I did hold that pernicious view, but now that I have heard this Dhamma teaching of the Venerable Sāriputta I have abandoned that pernicious view and have made the breakthrough to the Dhamma."<span class="note" id="n155"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.155] See n. <a href="sn22.83.html#n147">147</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"If, friend Yamaka, they were to ask you: ‘Friend Yamaka, when a bhikkhu is an arahant, one whose taints are destroyed, what happens to him with the breakup of the body, after death?’—being asked thus, what would you answer?"</p>

<p>"If they were to ask me this, friend, I would answer thus: ‘Friends, form is impermanent; what is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering has ceased and passed away. Feeling … Perception … Volitional formations … Consciousness is impermanent; what is impermanent is suffering; what is suffering has ceased and passed away.’ Being asked thus, friend, I would answer in such a way."<span class="note" id="n156"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.156] This passage can be read as a gloss on the Buddha’s famous dictum, "I make known just suffering and the cessation of suffering" (see end of <a href="sn22.86.html">SN22.86</a>).</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"Good, good, friend Yamaka! Now, friend Yamaka, I will make up a simile for you in order to convey this same meaning even more clearly. Suppose, friend Yamaka, there was a householder or a householder's son, a rich man, with much wealth and property, protected by a bodyguard. Then some man would appear who wanted to ruin him, to harm him, to endanger him, to take his life. <a class="pts_pn">sn.iii.113</a> It would occur to that man: ‘This householder or householder's son is a rich man, with much wealth and property, protected by a bodyguard. It won’t be easy to take his life by force. Let me get close to him and then take his life.’</p>

<p>"Then he would approach that householder or householder's son and say to him: ‘I would serve you, sir.’ Then the householder or householder's son would appoint him as a servant. The man would serve him, rising up before him, retiring after him, doing whatever he wants, agreeable in his conduct, endearing in his speech. The householder or householder's son would consider him a friend,<span class="note" id="n157"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.157] Ee <i>daheyya</i> may be better than <i>saddaheyya,</i> in Be and Se.</span></span></span> a bosom friend, and he would place trust in him. But when the man becomes aware that the householder or householder's son has placed trust in him, then, finding him alone, he would take his life with a sharp knife.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"What do you think, friend Yamaka, when that man had approached that householder or householder's son and said to him: ‘I would serve you, sir,’ wasn’t he a murderer even then, though the other did not recognize him as ‘my murderer’? And when the man was serving him, rising up before him, retiring after him, doing whatever he wants, agreeable in his conduct, endearing in his speech, wasn’t he a murderer then too, though the other did not recognize him as ‘my murderer’? And when the man came upon him while he was alone and took his life with a sharp knife, wasn’t he a murderer then too, though the other did not recognize him as ‘my murderer’?"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Yes, friend."</p>

<p>"So too, friend Yamaka,<span class="note" id="n158"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.158] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The uninstructed worldling attached to the round is like the gullible householder, the five fragile aggregates like the murderous enemy. When the enemy comes up to the householder and offers to serve him, that is like the time the aggregates are acquired at the moment of rebirth. When the householder takes the enemy to be his friend, that is like the time the worldling grasps the aggregates, thinking, "They are mine." The honour the householder bestows on the enemy, thinking, "He is my friend," is like the honour the worldling bestows on the aggregates by bathing them, feeding them, etc. The murder of the householder by the enemy is like the destruction of the worldling's life when the aggregates break up.</span></span></span> the uninstructed worldling, who is not a seer of the noble ones and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, who is not a seer of superior persons and is unskilled and undisciplined in their Dhamma, regards form as self, or self as possessing form, or form as in self, or self as in form.</p>
