<p><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Sakyans at Kapilavatthu in Nigrodha's Park. Now on that occasion a new assembly hall had just been built for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu and it had not yet been inhabited by any ascetic or brahmin or by any human being at all. Then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, a new council hall has just been built for the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu and it has not yet been inhabited by any ascetic or brahmin or by any human being at all. <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.183</a> Venerable sir, let the Blessed One be the first to use it. When the Blessed One has used it first, then the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu will use it afterwards. That will lead to their welfare and happiness for a long time."<span class="note" id="n191"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.191] This invitation reflects the widespread belief in South Asian religion that it is auspicious to invite a holy man to spend the first night in a new residence before the lay owners move in to occupy it. This honour would have been especially cherished by the Sakyans, who were the Buddha’s own kinsmen. Similar ceremonies are reported at <a href="../mn/mn53.html">MN&nbsp;I 353–54</a> and <a href="../dn/dn16.html">DN II 84–85</a> (= <a href="../ud/ud85.html">Ud&nbsp;85</a>–86).</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>The Blessed One consented by silence.</p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>Then, when the Sakyans understood that the Blessed One had consented, they rose from their seats and, after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on their right, they went to the new assembly hall. They covered it thoroughly with mats, prepared seats, put out a large water jug, and hung up an oil lamp. Then they approached the Blessed One and informed him of this, adding: "Let the Blessed One come at his own convenience."</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One dressed and, taking bowl and robe, went together with the Saṅgha of bhikkhus to the new assembly hall. After washing his feet, he entered the hall and sat down against the central pillar facing east. The bhikkhus too, after washing their feet, entered the hall and sat down against the western wall facing east, with the Blessed One in front of them. The Sakyans of Kapilavatthu too, after washing their feet, entered the hall and sat down against the eastern wall facing west, with the Blessed One in front of them.</p>

<p>The Blessed One then instructed, exhorted, inspired, and gladdened the Sakyans with a Dhamma talk through much of the night, after which he dismissed them, saying: "The night has passed, Gotamas.<span class="note" id="n192"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.192] He refers to them as Gotamas because they were members of the Gotama clan, to which he himself belonged.</span></span></span> You may go at your own convenience." <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.184</a></p>

<p>"Yes, venerable sir," they replied. Then they rose from their seats and, after paying homage to the Blessed One, keeping him on their right, they departed.</p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>Then, not long after the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu had left, the Blessed One addressed the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thus: "The Saṅgha of bhikkhus is free from sloth and torpor, Moggallana. Give a Dhamma talk to the bhikkhus. My back is aching, so I will stretch it."<span class="note" id="n193"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.193] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: During his six years of ascetic practice the Blessed One had experienced great bodily pain. Therefore, in his old age, he suffered from back winds (<i>piṭṭhivāta,</i> rheumatism?). Or else he lay down because he wanted to use the council hall in all four postures, having already used it by way of walking, standing, and sitting.</span></span></span></p>

<hr>
<p>"Yes, venerable sir," the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna replied.</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One prepared his outer robe folded in four and lay down on his right side in the lion's posture, with one foot overlapping the other, mindful and clearly comprehending, after noting in his mind the idea of rising. Thereupon the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna addressed the bhikkhus thus: "Friends, bhikkhus!"</p>

<hr>
<p>"Friend!" those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:</p>

<p>"I will teach you, friends, an exposition on the corrupted and the uncorrupted.<span class="note" id="n194"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.194] <i>Avassutapariyāya, anavassutapariyāya. Avassuta</i> means literally "flown into," or leaky, implying a mind permeated by defilements. The substantives avassuta and āsavā, and the verbs <i>anvassavati</i> and <i>anu(s)savati,</i> are all based on the same root su, "to flow." Waldschmidt has published a Skt version of Moggallana's discourse (see Bibliography).</span></span></span> Listen to it and attend closely, I will speak."</p>

<p>"Yes, friend," those bhikkhus replied. The Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said this:</p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>"How, friends, is one corrupted? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu is intent upon a pleasing form and repelled by a displeasing form.<span class="note" id="n195"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.195] As at <a href="sn35.132.html">SN35.132</a> (IV 119,27–120,11).</span></span></span> He dwells without having set up mindfulness of the body, with a limited mind, and he does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainder. <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.185</a> Having heard a sound with the ear … Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is intent upon a pleasing mental phenomenon and repelled by a displeasing mental phenomenon. He dwells without having set up mindfulness of the body, with a limited mind, and he does not understand as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainder.</p>

<p>"This is called, friends, a bhikkhu who is corrupted amidst forms cognizable by the eye, corrupted amidst sounds cognizable by the ear, corrupted amidst odours cognizable by the nose, corrupted amidst tastes cognizable by the tongue, corrupted amidst tactile objects cognizable by the body, corrupted amidst mental phenomena cognizable by the mind. When a bhikkhu dwells thus, if Māra approaches him through the eye, Māra gains access to him, Māra gets a hold on him. If Māra approaches him through the ear … through the mind, Māra gains access to him, Māra gets a hold on him.</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>"Suppose, friends, there is a shed made of reeds or of grass, dried up, desiccated, past its prime. If a man approaches it from the east with a blazing grass torch, or from the west, from the north, from the south, from below, or from above, whichever way he approaches it the fire gains access to it, the fire gets a hold on it. So too, friends, when a bhikkhu dwells thus, if Māra approaches him through the eye … through the mind, Māra gains access to him, Māra gets a hold on him.</p>

<p>"When a bhikkhu dwells thus, forms overwhelm him; he does not overwhelm forms. Sounds overwhelm him; <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.186</a> he does not overwhelm sounds. Odours overwhelm him; he does not overwhelm odours. Tastes overwhelm him; he does not overwhelm tastes. Tactile objects overwhelm him; he does not overwhelm tactile objects. Mental phenomena overwhelm him; he does not overwhelm mental phenomena. This is called, friends, a bhikkhu who is overwhelmed by forms, overwhelmed by sounds, overwhelmed by odours, overwhelmed by tastes, overwhelmed by tactile objects, overwhelmed by mental phenomena—one who is overwhelmed and who does not overwhelm. Evil unwholesome states have overwhelmed him, states that defile, that lead to renewed existence, that bring trouble, that result in suffering, and that lead to future birth, aging, and death.</p>

<hr>
<p>"It is in this way, friends, that one is corrupted.</p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>"And how, friends, is one uncorrupted? Here, having seen a form with the eye, a bhikkhu is not intent upon a pleasing form and not repelled by a displeasing form. He dwells having set up mindfulness of the body, with a measureless mind, and he understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainder. Having heard a sound with the ear … Having cognized a mental phenomenon with the mind, he is not intent upon a pleasing mental phenomenon and not repelled by a displeasing mental phenomenon. He dwells having set up mindfulness of the body, with a measureless mind, and he understands as it really is that liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, wherein those evil unwholesome states cease without remainder.</p>

<p>"This is called, friends, a bhikkhu who is uncorrupted amidst forms cognizable by the eye, uncorrupted amidst sounds cognizable by the ear, uncorrupted amidst odours cognizable by the nose, uncorrupted amidst tastes cognizable by the tongue, uncorrupted amidst tactile objects cognizable by the body, uncorrupted amidst mental phenomena cognizable by the mind. When a bhikkhu dwells thus, if Māra approaches him through the eye, Māra fails to gain access to him, Māra fails to get a hold on him. If Māra approaches him through the ear … through the mind, Māra fails to gain access to him, Māra fails to get a hold on him.</p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>"Suppose, friends, there is a peaked house or a hall <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.187</a> built of thickly packed clay and freshly plastered. If a man approaches it from the east with a blazing grass torch, or from the west, from the north, from the south, from below, or from above, whichever way he approaches it the fire fails to gain access to it, the fire fails to get a hold on it. So too, friends, when a bhikkhu dwells thus, if Māra approaches him through the eye … through the mind, Māra fails to gain access to him, Māra fails to get a hold on him.</p>

<p>"When a bhikkhu dwells thus, he overwhelms forms; forms do not overwhelm him. He overwhelms sounds; sounds do not overwhelm him. He overwhelms odours; odours do not overwhelm him. He overwhelms tastes; tastes do not overwhelm him. He overwhelms tactile objects; tactile objects do not overwhelm him. He overwhelms mental phenomena; mental phenomena do not overwhelm him. This is called, friends, a bhikkhu who overwhelms forms, who overwhelms sounds, who overwhelms odours, who overwhelms tastes, who overwhelms tactile objects, who overwhelms mental phenomena—one who overwhelms and who is not overwhelmed. He has overwhelmed those evil unwholesome states that defile, that lead to renewed existence, that bring trouble, that result in suffering, and that lead to future birth, aging, and death.</p>

<hr>
<p>"It is in this way, friends, that one is uncorrupted."</p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>Then the Blessed One got up and addressed the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna thus: "Good, good, Moggallana! You have spoken well to the bhikkhus the exposition on the corrupted and the uncorrupted."</p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>This is what the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna said. <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.188</a> The Teacher approved. Elated, those bhikkhus delighted in the Venerable Mahāmoggallāna's statement.</p>
