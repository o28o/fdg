<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Then the Venerable Mālunkyaputta approached the Blessed One … and said to him:<span class="note" id="n72"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.72] Mālunkyaputta appears at <a href="../mn/mn63.html">MN Nos. 63</a> and <a href="../mn/mn64.html">64</a>. His verses here are also at <a href="../tha/tha16.html#p794">Th&nbsp;794–817</a>. See too <a href="../an/an4.257.html">AN II 248–49</a>, where he again requests a teaching in his old age. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains that in his youth he had been negligent and had dallied with sensual pleasures; now in his old age he wanted to dwell in the forest and practise meditation.</span></span></span> "Venerable sir, it would be good if the Blessed One would teach me the Dhamma in brief, so that, having heard the Dhamma from the Blessed One, I might dwell alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Here now, Mālunkyaputta, what should I say to the young bhikkhus when a bhikkhu like you—old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage—asks me for an exhortation in brief?"<span class="note" id="n73"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.73] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The Blessed One speaks thus both to reproach him and to extol him. He reproaches him for putting off the work of an ascetic until old age, and extols him in order to set an example for the younger monks.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Although, venerable sir, I am old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage, let the Blessed One teach me the Dhamma in brief, let the Fortunate One teach me the Dhamma in brief. Perhaps I may understand the meaning of the Blessed One's statement, perhaps I may become an heir to the Blessed One's statement."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"What do you think, Mālunkyaputta, do you have any desire, lust, or affection for those forms cognizable by the eye that you have not seen and never saw before, that you do not see and would not think might be seen?"<span class="note" id="n74"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.74] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains <i>diṭṭhā adiṭṭhapubbā</i> as respectively "not seen in this existence" and "never seen before" in the past. An illustration can be found at <a href="sn42.11.html">SN42.11</a> (IV 329,20–22).</span></span></span></p>

<p>"No, venerable sir."</p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>"Do you have any desire, lust, or affection for those sounds cognizable by the ear … for those odours cognizable by the nose … for those tastes cognizable by the tongue … for those tactile objects cognizable by the body … <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.73</a> for those mental phenomena cognizable by the mind that you have not cognized and never cognized before, that you do not cognize and would not think might be cognized?"</p>

<p>"No, venerable sir."</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">10</span>"Here, Mālunkyaputta, regarding things seen, heard, sensed, and cognized by you: in the seen there will be merely the seen; in the heard there will be merely the heard; in the sensed there will be merely the sensed; in the cognized there will be merely the cognized.</p>

<p>"When, Mālunkyaputta, regarding things seen, heard, sensed, and cognized by you, in the seen there will be merely the seen, in the heard there will be merely the heard, in the sensed there will be merely the sensed, in the cognized there will be merely the cognized, then, Mālunkyaputta, you will not be ‘by that.’ When, Mālunkyaputta, you are not ‘by that,’ then you will not be ‘therein. ’ When, Mālunkyaputta, you are not ‘therein,’ then you will be neither here nor beyond nor in between the two. This itself is the end of suffering."<span class="note" id="n75"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.75] The same advice is given to the ascetic Bāhiya Dārucīriya at <a href="../ud/ud1.10.html">Ud&nbsp;8,5–1</a>2. The meaning is extremely compressed and in places the passage seems to defy standard grammar (e.g., by treating <i>na tena</i> and <i>na tattha</i> as nominative predicates). <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> gives a long explanation, which I translate here partly abridged:

<br class="half">In the form base, i.e., in what is seen by eye-consciousness, "there will be merely the seen." For eye-consciousness sees only form in form, not some essence that is permanent, etc. So too for the remaining types of consciousness (Spk-pṭ: i.e., for the <i>javanas</i>), there will be here merely the seen. Or alternatively: What is called "the seen in the seen" is eye-consciousness, which means the cognizing of form in form. "Merely" indicates the limit <i>(mattā ti pamāṇā)</i>. It has merely the seen; thus "merely the seen," (an attribute of) the mind. The meaning is: "My mind will be just a mere eye-consciousness." This is what is meant: As eye-consciousness is not affected by lust, hatred, or delusion in relation to a form that has come into raṅge, so the <i>javana</i> will be just like a mere eye-consciousness by being destitute of lust, etc. I will set up the <i>javana</i> with just eye-consciousness as the limit. I will not go beyond the limit and allow the mind to arise by way of lust, etc. So too for the heard and the sensed. The "cognized" is the object cognized by mind-door adverting <i>(manodvārāvajjana)</i>. In that cognized, "merely the cognized" is the adverting (consciousness) as the limit. As one does not become lustful, etc., by adverting, so I will set up my mind with adverting as the limit, not allowing it to arise by way of lust, etc. You will not be "by that" <i>(na tena)</i>: you will not be aroused by that lust, or irritated by that hatred, or deluded by that delusion. Then you will not be "therein" <i>(na tattha)</i>: When you are not aroused by that lust, etc., then "you will not be therein"—bound, attached, established in what is seen, heard, sensed, and cognized.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p"><a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>'s explanation of "neither here nor beyond nor in between the two" is the same as that summed up in n. <a href="sn35.html#fn.IV.53">53</a> above, again proposed to avoid having to admit an intermediate state.</span>

<br class="half"><span class="p">The verses that follow are intended to explicate the Buddha’s brief dictum. From these, it seems that to go beyond "merely the seen" is to ascribe a pleasing sign <i>(piyanimitta)</i>—an attractive attribute—to the objects seen, heard, etc., and from this such defilements as attraction and annoyance result.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then, dwelling alone, withdrawn, diligent, ardent, and resolute, the Venerable Mālunkyaputta, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, in this very life entered and dwelt in that unsurpassed goal of the holy life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness. He directly knew: "Destroyed is birth, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more for this state of being." And the Venerable Mālunkyaputta became one of the arahants.</p>
