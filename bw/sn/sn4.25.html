<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Then Māra the Evil One, having spoken these verses of disappointment in the presence of the Blessed One, went away from that spot and sat down cross-legged on the ground not far from the Blessed One, silent, dismayed, with his shoulders drooping, downcast, brooding, unable to speak, scratching the ground with a stick.<span class="note" id="n321"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.321] This passage, as far as "unable to speak," is the stock description of the defeated contestant; also at <a href="../mn/mn22.html">MN&nbsp;I 132,28–30</a>, <a href="../mn/mn35.html">234,1–2,</a> <a href="../mn/mn38.html">258,28–30</a>. Se and Ee1 make this paragraph the last of the preceding sutta, but I follow Be and Ee2. As the two suttas form a single narrative, the division between them is arbitrary.</span></span></span></p>

<p>Then Māra's daughters—Taṇha, Arati, and rāga—approached Māra the Evil One and addressed him in verse:<span class="note" id="n322"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.322] Their names mean craving, discontent, and lusting. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains that they saw their father in a despondent mood and approached to find out the reason. The story of the Buddha’s encounter with Māra’s daughters is also recorded at Ja I 78-79 and Dhp-a III 195-98; see BL 3:33-34. There it is clearly set in the fifth week after the enlightenment. The BHS parallel at Mvu III 281-86 is also assigned to this period; see Jones, 3:269-74.</span></span></span></p>

<br>And he’ll be under your control."<span class="note" id="n323"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.323] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>'s explanation shows that there is more to the simile than meets the eye: "They capture an elephant and lead him out of the forest by sending a female decoy, who entices him by displaying her feminine wiles."</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>Then Māra's daughters—Taṇha, Arati, and rāga—approached the Blessed One and stood to one side. Standing to one side, Māra's daughter Taṇha addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>

Mahakaccana provides a long commentary on this verse at <a href="../an/an10.26.html">AN V 47,3–48,4</a>.

The sixth: he has crossed the sixth flood of defilements, that pertaining to the mind door.

In mind well liberated <i>(suvimuttacitto)</i>: well liberated by the liberation of the fruit of arahantship. Not generating <i>(asaṅkhārano)</i>: not generating the three types of volitional formations (see <a href="sn12.51.html">SN12.51</a>; also n. <a href="sn2.15.html#n165">165</a>). Meditating thought-free in the fourth jhāna.

The finite verb seems to me preferable to the absolutive <i>acchejja</i> of Be and Ee1 &amp; 2; the variant <i>acchecchi</i> suggested by PED may also be acceptable. This verb should be distinguished from <i>acchejja</i> (or <i>acchijja,</i> Ee1) in pāda d, an absolutive of <i>acchindati,</i> to rob, to snatch away. The Be and Ee1 reading of pāda a may have arisen through a confusion of the two forms. I read pāda b: <i>addha tarissanti bahū ca satta.</i> Be, Ee2, and SS read the last word as <i>saddhā,</i> but the gloss in <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> supports <i>satta: addha aññe pi bahujana ekamsena tarissanti.</i> The BHT version of Mvu is too different to be of help and may be corrupt, but Jones (at SN3.273, n. 4) suggests replacing <i>rakta</i> with <i>sattva,</i> which would then support the reading I have adopted. <i>Tarissanti</i> is certainly preferable to the v.l. <i>carissanti,</i> found in Be, Se, and Ee1.</span></span></span></p>
