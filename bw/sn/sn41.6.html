<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Venerable Kamabhū was dwelling at Macchikasaṇḍa in the Wild Mango Grove. Then Citta the householder approached the Venerable Kamabhū, paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said to him: "Venerable sir, how many kinds of formations are there?"<span class="note" id="n297"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.297] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains that Citta used to abide in cessation (Spk-pṭ: as a nonreturner) and thus he raised the question to ask about the formations that are the basis for cessation (see n. <a href="#n299">299</a>).</span></span></span></p>

<p>"There are, householder, three kinds of formations: the bodily formation, the verbal formation, and the mental formation."<span class="note" id="n298"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.298] The three terms—<i>kāyasaṅkhara, vacīsaṅkhāra, cittasȧkhara</i>—are in Pali identical with those that make up the saṅkhāra factor of dependent origination (as at <b><a href="sn12.2.html">SN12.2</a></b>), but in this context the purport is different, as the following discussion will show. Here, in the compounds <i>kāyasaṅkhāra</i> and <i>cittasaṅkhāra, saṅkhāra</i> clearly has a passive sense: what is formed or generated <i>(saṅkharīyati)</i> in dependence on the body or the mind. In the case of <i>vacīsaṅkhāra</i> the sense is active: what generates <i>(saṅkharoti)</i> speech.</span></span></span> "Good, venerable sir," Citta the householder said. Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Kamabhū's statement, he asked him a further question: "But, venerable sir, what is the bodily formation? What is the verbal formation? What is the mental formation?"</p>

<p>"In-breathing and out-breathing, householder, are the bodily formation; thought and examination are the verbal formation; perception and feeling are the mental formation."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Good, venerable sir," Citta the householder said. Then … he asked him a further question: "But, venerable sir, why are in-breathing and out-breathing the bodily formation? Why are thought and examination the verbal formation? Why are perception and feeling the mental formation?"</p>

<p>"Householder, in-breathing and out-breathing are bodily, these things are dependent upon the body; that is why in-breathing and out-breathing are the bodily formation. First one thinks and examines, then afterwards one breaks into speech; that is why thought and examination are the verbal formation. Perception and feeling are mental, these things are dependent upon the mind; that is why perception and feeling are the mental formation."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Saying, "Good, venerable sir," … he then asked him a further question: "Venerable sir, how does the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling come about?"<span class="note" id="n299"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.299] The question refers to <i>saññāvedayitanirodha</i>, also called <i>nirodhasamāpatti,</i> the attainment of cessation, a meditative state in which mind and all mental functions stop. It is said to be accessible only to arahants and nonreturners who have mastered the eight attainments of samādhi. For a detailed treatment according to the commentarial method, see Vism 702–9 (Ppn 23:16–52). <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> says Citta had asked this question to find out if the monk was familiar with the attainment.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Householder, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling, it does not occur to him: ‘I will attain the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I am attaining the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I have attained the cessation of perception and feeling’; <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.294</a> but rather his mind has previously been developed in such a way that it leads him to such a state."<span class="note" id="n300"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.300] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: This means that before attaining cessation he has delimited the duration of the attainment, resolving, "I will be mindless <i>(acittaka)</i> for such a time."</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Saying, "Good, venerable sir," … he then asked him a further question: "Venerable sir, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling, which of these things ceases first in him: the bodily formation, the verbal formation, or the mental formation?"</p>

<p>"Householder, when a bhikkhu is attaining the cessation of perception and feeling, first the verbal formation ceases, after that the bodily formation, and after that the mental formation."<span class="note" id="n301"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.301] The verbal formation (thought and examination) ceases in the second jhāna; the bodily formation (in-and-out breathing) ceases in the fourth jhāna; the mental formation (perception and feeling) ceases on entering the attainment of cessation.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Saying, "Good, venerable sir," … he then asked him a further question: "Venerable sir, what is the difference between one who is dead and gone, and a bhikkhu who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling?"</p>

<p>"Householder, in the case of one who is dead and gone, the bodily formation has ceased and subsided, the verbal formation has ceased and subsided, the mental formation has ceased and subsided; his vitality is extinguished, his physical heat has been dissipated, and his faculties are fully broken up. In the case of a bhikkhu who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling, the bodily formation has ceased and subsided, the verbal formation has ceased and subsided, the mental formation has ceased and subsided; but his vitality is not extinguished, his physical heat has not been dissipated, and his faculties are serene.<span class="note" id="n302"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.302] <i>Indriyāni vippasannāni.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The sense faculties are fatigued when activity occurs and external objects impinge on the senses. They are afflicted, soiled as it were, like a mirror set up at a crossroads hit by dust carried by the wind. But as a mirror placed in a casket and deposited in a case shines within, so the five senses of a bhikkhu who has attained cessation shine brightly within cessation.</span></span></span> This is the difference between one who is dead and gone, and a bhikkhu who has attained the cessation of perception and feeling."</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Saying, "Good, venerable sir," … he then asked him a further question: "Venerable sir, how does emergence from the cessation of perception and feeling come about?"</p>

<p>"Householder, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, it does not occur to him: ‘I will emerge from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I am emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling,’ or ‘I have emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling’; but rather his mind has previously been developed in such a way that it leads him to such a state."<span class="note" id="n303"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.303] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Before attaining cessation, at the time of delimiting the duration, he resolves, "I will be mindless for such a time and afterwards will again become mindful."</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Saying, "Good, venerable sir," … he then asked him a further question: "Venerable sir, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, which of these things arises first in him: the bodily formation, the verbal formation, or the mental formation?"</p>

<p>"Householder, when a bhikkhu is emerging from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, first the mental formation arises, after that the bodily formation, and after that the verbal formation."<span class="note" id="n304"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.304] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: When one emerges from cessation the mind of fruition attainment is the first to arise. It is with reference to the perception and feeling associated with that mind that it is said, "First the mental formation arises." Afterwards, at the time of <i>bhavaṅga,</i> the bodily formation (breathing) arises, and still later, at the time of regular activity, the verbal formation resumes, namely, thought and examination able to originate speech.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Saying, "Good, venerable sir," … he then asked him a further question: "Venerable sir, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, how many kinds of contact touch him?"</p>

<p>"Householder, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, three kinds of contact touch him: emptiness-contact, signless-contact, undirected-contact." <span class="note" id="n305"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.305] <i>Suññataphassa, animittaphassa, appaṇihitaphassa.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: These can be explained by way of their own quality <i>(saguṇa)</i> or by way of their object <i>(ārammaṇa)</i>. By way of quality: the attainment of fruition <i>(phalasamāpatti)</i> is called emptiness, and the accompanying contact is called emptiness-contact; the same method in the other two cases. By way of object: Nibbāna is called emptiness because it is empty of lust, etc.; signless, because the signs of lust, etc., are absent; and undirected, because it is not directed towards lust, hatred, or delusion. The contact of the arisen fruition attainment, which takes emptiness-Nibbāna as object, is called emptiness-contact; the same method in the other two cases.

<br class="half">Fruition attainment is a special meditative attainment in which the mind directly experiences the bliss of Nibbāna. It is said to be of four levels, corresponding to the four levels of awakening (the fruition attainment of stream-entry, etc.). See Vism 698–702 (Ppn 23:3–15).</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Saying, "Good, venerable sir," … he then asked him a further question: "Venerable sir, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, towards what does his mind slant, slope, and incline?"</p>

<p>"Householder, when a bhikkhu has emerged from the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, his mind slants, slopes, and inclines towards seclusion."<span class="note" id="n306"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.306] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: It is Nibbāna that is called seclusion <i>(viveka)</i>. His mind slants, slopes, and inclines towards that seclusion.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"Good, venerable sir," Citta the householder said. Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the Venerable Kamabhū's statement, he asked him a further question: "Venerable sir, how many things are helpful for the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling?"</p>

<p>"Indeed, householder, you are asking last what should have been asked first; but still I will answer you. For the attainment of the cessation of perception and feeling, two things are helpful: serenity and insight."<span class="note" id="n307"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.307] This is said because cessation is attained by first entering each jhāna and formless attainment and then contemplating it with insight by way of the three characteristics. The procedure is explained at Vism 705–7 (Ppn 23:31–43).</span></span></span></p>
