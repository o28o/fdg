<p><span class="parno">1</span>Then Rāsiya the chief went up to the Buddha, bowed, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<p>“Sir, I have heard this: ‘The ascetic Gotama criticizes all forms of mortification. He categorically condemns and denounces those self-mortifiers who live rough.’ Do those who say this repeat what the Buddha has said, and not misrepresent him with an untruth? Is their explanation in line with the teaching? Are there any legitimate grounds for rebuke and criticism?”</p>

<hr>

<p>“Chief, those who say this do not repeat what I have said. They misrepresent me with what is false, hollow, and untrue.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>These two extremes should not be cultivated by one who has gone forth. Indulgence in sensual pleasures, which is low, crude, ordinary, ignoble, and pointless. And indulgence in self-mortification, which is painful, ignoble, and pointless.</p>

<p>Avoiding these two extremes, the Realized One woke up by understanding the middle way, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.</p>

<p>And what is that middle way? It is simply this noble eightfold path, that is: right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right immersion.</p>

<hr>

<p>This, chief, is the middle way, woken up to by the Realized One, which gives vision and knowledge, and leads to peace, direct knowledge, awakening, and extinguishment.</p>
