<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park. Now on that occasion the bhikkhunī Khema,<span class="note" id="n373"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.373] At <a href="../an/an1.235-247.html">AN1.236</a> (AN I 25,19) she is declared the foremost bhikkhunī among those with great wisdom <i>(etadaggaṁ mahāpaññānaṁ)</i>, and at <a href="sn17.24.html">SN17.24</a> she is extolled as a model for the other bhikkhunīs. For a biographical sketch, see Hecker, "Great Woman Disciples of the Buddha," in Nyanaponika and Hecker, <i>Great Disciples of the Buddha,</i> pp. 263–66, and Pruitt, <i>Commentary on the Verses of the Therīs,</i> pp. 164–74.</span></span></span> while wandering on tour among the Kosalans, had taken up residence in Toraṇavatthu between Sāvatthī and Saketa. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, while travelling from Saketa to Sāvatthī, took up residence for one night in Toraṇavatthu between Saketa and Sāvatthī. Then King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed a man thus: "Go, good man, and find out whether there is any ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu whom I could visit today."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Yes, sire," the man replied, but though he traversed the whole of Toraṇavatthu he did not see any ascetic or brahmin there whom King Pasenadi could visit. The man did see, however, the bhikkhunī Khema resident in Toraṇavatthu, so he approached King Pasenadi and said to him:</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Sire, there is no ascetic or brahmin in Toraṇavatthu whom your majesty could visit. But, sire, there is the bhikkhunī named Khema, a disciple of the Blessed One, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. Now a good report concerning this revered lady has spread about thus: <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.375</a> ‘She is wise, competent, intelligent, learned, a splendid speaker, ingenious.’ Let your majesty visit her."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the bhikkhunī Khema, paid homage to her, sat down to one side, and said to her:</p>

<hr>
<p>"How is it, revered lady, does the Tathāgata exist after death?"<span class="note" id="n374"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.374] As at <a href="sn16.12.html">SN16.12</a>, <a href="sn24.18.html">24:15–18</a>, <a href="sn33.1.html">33:1–55</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this: ‘The Tathāgata exists after death.’"</p>

<p>"Then, revered lady, does the Tathāgata not exist after death?"</p>

<p>"Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this either: ‘The Tathāgata does not exist after death.’"</p>

<p>"How is it then, revered lady, does the Tathāgata both exist and not exist after death?"</p>

<p>"Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this: ‘The Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death.’"</p>

<p>"Then, revered lady, does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?"</p>

<p>"Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this either: ‘The Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death.’"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"How is this, revered lady? When asked, ‘How is it, revered lady, does the Tathāgata exist after death?’ … And when asked, ‘Then, revered lady, does the Tathāgata neither exist nor not exist after death?’—in each case you say: ‘Great king, the Blessed One has not declared this.’ What now, <a class="pts_pn">sn.iv.376</a> revered lady, is the cause and reason why this has not been declared by the Blessed One?"</p>

<hr>
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"Well then, great king, I will question you about this same matter. Answer as you see fit. What do you think, great king? Do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician who can count the grains of sand in the river Ganges thus: ‘There are so many grains of sand,’ or ‘There are so many hundreds of grains of sand,’ or ‘There are so many thousands of grains of sand,’ or ‘There are so many hundreds of thousands of grains of sand’?"</p>

<p>"No, revered lady."</p>

<p>"Then, great king, do you have an accountant or calculator or mathematician who can count the water in the great ocean thus: ‘There are so many gallons of water,’ or ‘There are so many hundreds of gallons of water,’ or ‘There are so many thousands of gallons of water,’ or ‘There are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water’?"</p>

<p>"No, revered lady. For what reason? Because the great ocean is deep, immeasurable, hard to fathom."</p>

<p>"So too,<span class="note" id="n375"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.375] The reply here is identical with the Buddha’s famous reply to Vacchagotta at <a href="../mn/mn72.html#p8">MN72</a> (<a href="../mn/mn72.html">MN&nbsp;I 487–88</a>).

He is "liberated from reckoning in terms of form" <i>(rūpasaṅkhāya vimutto)</i>, that is, because there will be no arising of form in the future for him, even the statement, "He will be such and such" through his physical form and mental qualities, loses its validity; thus he is liberated even from description by way of form. He is deep <i>(gambhīra)</i> through the depth of his inclination <i>(ajjhāsayagambhı̄ratā)</i> and through the depth of his qualities <i>(guṇagambhīratā)</i>. As to the description that might be used in relation to the omniscient Tathāgata with such deep qualities, considering him as a being, when one sees the nonexistence (invalidity) of this description (Spk-pṭ: "a being") owing to the nonexistence (Spk-pṭ: of the five aggregates), then the statement "The Tathāgata—considered as a being—exists after death" does not apply, i.e., it is not valid.</span></span></span> ‘The Tathāgata exists after death’ does not apply; ‘the Tathāgata does not exist after death’ does not apply; ‘the Tathāgata both exists and does not exist after death’ does not apply; ‘the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death’ does not apply.</p>

<hr>
<p>Then King Pasenadi of Kosala, having delighted and rejoiced in the bhikkhunī Khema's statement, rose from his seat, paid homage to her, and departed, keeping her on his right.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>Then, on a later occasion, King Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One. Having approached, he paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>
