<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At Sāvatthī. "Bhikkhus, just as this body, sustained by nutriment, subsists in dependence on nutriment and does not subsist without nutriment, so too the five hindrances, sustained by nutriment, subsist in dependence on nutriment and do not subsist without nutriment.<span class="note" id="n53"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.53] Nutriment <i>(āhāra)</i> here has the meaning of condition <i>(paccaya)</i>. This portion of the sutta is repeated below at <a href="sn46.51.html">SN46:51</a>, to which <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> gives a detailed explanation of the nutriments for the individual enlightenment factors.

There is, bhikkhus, the sign of the beautiful: <span class="note" id="n54"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.54] The sign of the beautiful <i>(subhanimitta)</i> is a sensually attractive object, particularly an object that arouses sexual desire. The word nimitta is difficult to render in a way that fits all the major contexts where it occurs. I returned to "sign" only after several experiments with alternatives—"aspect," "feature," and "appearance"—proved unsatisfactory. Elsewhere it clearly means basis, cause, condition (e.g., at <a href="sn48.40.html">SN48:40</a>; V 213, 16, etc.).

The commentaries consistently explain it as attention directed to the impermanent as permanent, to suffering as happiness, to the selfless as self, and to the foul as beautiful. This explanation is found already at Vibh 373.</span></span></span> frequently giving careless attention to it is the nutriment for the arising of unarisen sensual desire and for the increase and expansion of arisen sensual desire.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is the nutriment for the arising of unarisen ill will and for the increase and expansion of arisen ill will? There is, bhikkhus, the sign of the repulsive:<span class="note" id="n55"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.55] <i>Paṭighanimitta.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The sign of the repulsive is aversion <i>(paṭigha)</i> or a repulsive object <i>(paṭighārammaṇa)</i>.</span></span></span> frequently giving careless attention to it is the nutriment for the arising of unarisen ill will and for the increase and expansion of arisen ill will.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is the nutriment for the arising of unarisen restlessness and remorse and for the increase and expansion of arisen restlessness and remorse?

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"Bhikkhus, just as this body, sustained by nutriment, subsists in dependence on nutriment and does not subsist without nutriment, so too the seven factors of enlightenment, sustained by nutriment, subsist in dependence on nutriment and do not subsist without nutriment.</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen enlightenment factor of mindfulness and for the fulfilment by development of the arisen enlightenment factor of mindfulness? There are, bhikkhus, things that are the basis for the enlightenment factor of mindfulness:<span class="note" id="n58"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.58] <i>Satisambojjhaṅgaṭṭhaniya dhammā.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The things that become objects of mindfulness (Spk-pṭ: the four establishments of mindfulness), the thirty-seven aids to enlightenment, and the nine supramundane states.</span></span></span> frequently giving careful attention to them is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen enlightenment factor of mindfulness and for the fulfilment by development of the arisen enlightenment factor of mindfulness. <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.66</a></p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen enlightenment factor of discrimination of states and for the fulfilment by development of the arisen enlightenment factor of discrimination of states? There are, bhikkhus, wholesome and unwholesome states, blameable and blameless states, inferior and superior states, dark and bright states with their counterparts: <span class="note" id="n59"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.59] <i>Kaṇhasukkasappaṭibhāga.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Dark states are "with counterparts" because they yield dark results, and bright states because they yield bright results; the meaning is "having similar results." Or "with counterparts" means "with opposites": the dark states have the bright as their opposites, the bright the dark. Or "with counterparts" means "with exclusion": the unwholesome excludes the wholesome and yields its own results, and conversely.

<br class="half">An extended example of the opposition between good and bad states is found in <b><a href="../mn/mn8.html">MN8</a></b>, where the Buddha enumerates forty-four pairs of wholesome and unwholesome opposites. The explanation of this enlightenment factor suggests that while "discrimination of states" may be technically identified with <i>paññā,</i> the initial function of <i>paññā</i> as an enlightenment factor is not to discern the three characteristics, etc., but simply to discriminate between the good and bad mental states that become apparent with the deepening of mindfulness.</span></span></span> frequently giving careful attention to them is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen enlightenment factor of discrimination of states and for the fulfilment by development of the arisen enlightenment factor of discrimination of states.</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen enlightenment factor of energy and for the fulfilment by development of the arisen enlightenment factor of energy?

There are, bhikkhus, things that are the basis for the enlightenment factor of rapture: frequently giving careful attention to them is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen enlightenment factor of rapture and for the fulfilment by development of the arisen enlightenment factor of rapture.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen enlightenment factor of tranquillity and for the fulfilment by development of the arisen enlightenment factor of tranquillity?

<br class="half">The commentaries frequently interpret the pair, body and mind, mentioned in the texts in the light of the Abhidhamma, which draws a contrast between mind <i>(citta)</i>, the chief factor in cognition, and its accompanying "body" of mental factors <i>(cetasika)</i>, which perform secondary cognitive functions. It seems, however, that in such passages as the present one, "body" was intended quite literally as meaning the physical body, considered as actively contributing to the qualitative tone of an experience.</span></span></span> frequently giving careful attention to them is the nutriment for the arising of the unarisen enlightenment factor of tranquillity and for the fulfilment by development of the arisen enlightenment factor of tranquillity.</p>
