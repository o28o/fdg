In sutta usage, however, the perception of foulness <i>(asubhasaññā)</i> is explained as the contemplation of the thirty-one parts of the body (as at <a href="../an/an10.60.html">AN V 109,19–27</a>, increased to thirty-two in Paṭis and the commentaries by the addition of the brain).

Sensual desire, (temporarily) abandoned in these six ways, is fully abandoned by the path of arahantship. Spk-pṭ: This is said by taking sensual desire, according to the Abhidhamma method, to represent all greed (i.e., greed for existence as well as greed for sensual pleasures).</span></span></span></p>
