<p><span class="parno">1</span>At Sāvatthī.</p>

<p>Then Saṅgārava the brahmin went up to the Buddha, and exchanged greetings with him. When the greetings and polite conversation were over, he sat down to one side and said to the Buddha:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>“What is the cause, Master Gotama, what is the reason why sometimes even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced? And why is it that sometimes even hymns that are long-unpracticed spring to mind, let alone those that are practiced?”</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>“Brahmin, there’s a time when your heart is overcome and mired in sensual desire and you don’t truly understand the escape from sensual desire that has arisen. At that time you don’t truly know or see your own good, the good of another, or the good of both. Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Suppose there was a bowl of water that was mixed with dye such as red lac, turmeric, indigo, or rose madder. Even a person with good eyesight checking their own reflection wouldn’t truly know it or see it.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Furthermore, when your heart is overcome and mired in ill will … Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced.</p>

<hr>

At that time you don’t truly know or see your own good, the good of another, or the good of both. Even hymns that are long-practiced don’t spring to mind, let alone those that are not practiced. This is the cause, brahmin, this is the reason why sometimes even hymns that are long-practiced aren’t clear to the mind, let alone those that are not practiced.</p>
