When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Master Gotama, what is the cause and reason why sometimes even those hymns that have been recited over a long period do not recur to the mind, let alone those that have not been recited?

Thus: (i) sensual desire is suppressed by the first jhāna based on foulness and eradicated by the path of arahantship (since kāmacchanda is here interpreted widely enough to include desire for any object, not only for sensual pleasures); (ii) ill will is suppressed by the first jhāna based on lovingkindness and eradicated by the path of nonreturning; (iii) sloth and torpor are suppressed by the perception of light (i.e., visualization of a bright light, like the disc of the sun or the full moon) and eradicated by the path of arahantship; (iv) restlessness and remorse are suppressed by serenity, remorse is eradicated by the path of nonreturning and restlessness by the path of arahantship; and (v) doubt is suppressed by the defining of phenomena (<i>dhammavavatthāna;</i> see Vism 587–89; Ppn 18:3–8) and eradicated by the path of stream-entry.</span></span></span> on that occasion one neither knows nor sees as it really is one's own good, or the good of others, or the good of both.
