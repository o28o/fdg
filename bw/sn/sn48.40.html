<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span><span class="note" id="n214"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.214] <i>Uppaṭipātika.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Though taught in the order that accords with the taste of the Dhamma (following Be: <i>yathādhammarasena;</i> Se has <i>yathādhammārammaṇavasena</i>), it is named "Irregular Order" because it is not taught like the other suttas in this Analysis of Faculties. Spk-pṭ: What is meant is that it is taught in the sequence of things to be abandoned, not like the other suttas which proceed in the regular sequence beginning with the pleasure faculty.</span></span></span>"Bhikkhus, there are these five faculties. What five? The pleasure faculty … the equanimity faculty.</p>

<p>"Here, bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu is dwelling diligent, ardent, and resolute, there arises in him the pain faculty. He understands thus: ‘There has arisen in me this pain faculty. That has a basis, a source, a causal formation, a condition.<span class="note" id="n215"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.215] <i>Sanimittaṁ sanidānaṁ sasaṅkhāraṁ sappaccayaṁ.</i> All these terms are synonymous.</span></span></span> It is impossible for that pain faculty to arise without a basis, without a source, without a causal formation, without a condition.’ He understands the pain faculty; he understands the origin of the pain faculty; he understands the cessation of the pain faculty; and he understands where the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder.</p>

<p>"And where does the arisen pain faculty cease without remainder? <span class="note" id="n216"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.216] From this point on the sutta is quoted extensively at Vism 165–66. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>'s explanations correspond to Vism 166 (Ppn 4:186–89). In the following notes I select only the chief points.</span></span></span> Here, bhikkhus, secluded from sensual pleasures, secluded from unwholesome states, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the first jhāna, which is accompanied by thought and examination, with rapture and happiness born of seclusion. And it is here that the arisen pain faculty ceases without remainder.<span class="note" id="n217"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.217] Spk: The pain faculty actually ceases and is abandoned at the moment of the access to the first jhāna; displeasure, etc., (at the access) to the second jhāna, etc. Nevertheless, their cessation is said to take place in the jhānas themselves because their reinforced cessation <i>(atisayanirodha)</i> occurs there. Simple cessation occurs at the access, reinforced cessation in the jhānas. Thus, for instance, though the pain faculty has ceased in the access to the first jhāna, it may arise again through contact with flies and mosquitoes or because of an uncomfortable seat; but not in absorption. (Within the absorption), when his whole body is suffused with rapture and engulfed in happiness, the pain faculty has thoroughly ceased because it is beaten away by opposition.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has understood the cessation of the pain faculty. He directs his mind accordingly.<span class="note" id="n218"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.218] I read with Se and Ee <i>tathatthāya cittaṁ upasaṁharati;</i> Be has <i>tadatthāya</i>. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The nonattainer directs his mind for the purpose of arousing it; the attainer, for the purpose of entering it.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"Here, bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu is dwelling diligent, ardent, and resolute, there arises in him the displeasure faculty. <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.214</a> He understands thus: ‘There has arisen in me this displeasure faculty. That has a basis, a source, a causal formation, a condition. It is impossible for that displeasure faculty to arise without a basis, without a source, without a causal formation, without a condition. ’ He understands the displeasure faculty; he understands the origin of the displeasure faculty; he understands the cessation of the displeasure faculty; and he understands where the arisen displeasure faculty ceases without remainder.</p>

<p>"And where does the arisen displeasure faculty cease without remainder? With the subsiding of thought and examination, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the second jhāna, which has internal confidence and unification of mind, is without thought and examination, and has rapture and happiness born of concentration. And it is here that the arisen displeasure faculty ceases without remainder.<span class="note" id="n219"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.219] This seems difficult to square with the usual jhāna formula, which indicates that the first jhāna is already free from all unwholesome states, including <i>domanassa.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The faculty of displeasure is abandoned in the access to the second jhāna but arises again when there is bodily fatigue and mental strain on account of thought and examination. But in the second jhāna, which is devoid of thought and examination, it does not arise at all.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has understood the cessation of the displeasure faculty. He directs his mind accordingly.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"Here, bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu is dwelling diligent, ardent, and resolute, there arises in him the pleasure faculty. He understands thus: ‘There has arisen in me this pleasure faculty. That has a basis, a source, a causal formation, a condition. It is impossible for that pleasure faculty to arise without a basis, without a source, without a causal formation, without a condition.’ He understands the pleasure faculty; he understands the origin of the pleasure faculty; he understands the cessation of the pleasure faculty; and he understands where the arisen pleasure faculty ceases without remainder.</p>

<p>"And where does the arisen pleasure faculty cease without remainder? With the fading away as well of rapture, a bhikkhu dwells equanimous and, mindful and clearly comprehending, experiences happiness with the body; he enters and dwells in the third jhāna of which the noble ones declare: ‘He is equanimous, mindful, one who dwells happily.’ And it is here that the arisen pleasure faculty ceases without remainder.<span class="note" id="n220"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.220] The pleasure faculty <i>(sukhindriya)</i> here is bodily pleasant feeling, not the happiness (also called <i>sukha</i>) the meditator is said to "experience with the body" in the third jhāna. The latter <i>sukha</i> is actually mental happiness, identical with <i>somanassa.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The pleasure faculty is abandoned already in the access to the third jhāna, but it may arise when the body is touched by the sublime physical phenomena originating from rapture; but it does not arise in the third jhāna itself, for there the rapture that is a condition for bodily pleasure has entirely ceased.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has understood the cessation of the pleasure faculty. He directs his mind accordingly. <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.215</a></p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Here, bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu is dwelling diligent, ardent, and resolute, there arises in him the joy faculty. He understands thus: ‘There has arisen in me this joy faculty. That has a basis, a source, a causal formation, a condition. It is impossible for that joy faculty to arise without a basis, without a source, without a causal formation, without a condition.’ He understands the joy faculty; he understands the origin of the joy faculty; he understands the cessation of the joy faculty; and he understands where the arisen joy faculty ceases without remainder.</p>

<p>"And where does the arisen joy faculty cease without remainder? With the abandoning of pleasure and pain, and with the previous passing away of joy and displeasure, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the fourth jhāna, which is neither painful nor pleasant and includes the purification of mindfulness by equanimity. And it is here that the arisen joy faculty ceases without remainder.<span class="note" id="n221"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.221] Here the explanation in the sutta corresponds perfectly with the usual jhāna formula. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Though the joy faculty has been abandoned even in the access to the fourth jhāna, because it is still close by it may arise again, for in the absence of equanimity that has reached the level of absorption (such joy) has not been fully overcome. But it does not arise in the fourth jhāna.</span></span></span></p>

<p>"This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu who has understood the cessation of the joy faculty. He directs his mind accordingly.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"Here, bhikkhus, while a bhikkhu is dwelling diligent, ardent, and resolute, there arises in him the equanimity faculty. He understands thus: ‘There has arisen in me this equanimity faculty. That has a basis, a source, a causal formation, a condition. It is impossible for that equanimity faculty to arise without a basis, without a source, without a causal formation, without a condition. ’ He understands the equanimity faculty; he understands the origin of the equanimity faculty; he understands the cessation of the equanimity faculty; and he understands where the arisen equanimity faculty ceases without remainder.</p>

<p>"And where does the arisen equanimity faculty cease without remainder? Here, bhikkhus, having completely transcended the base of neither-perception-nor-nonperception, a bhikkhu enters and dwells in the cessation of perception and feeling. And it is here that the arisen equanimity faculty ceases without remainder.</p>

<p>"This, bhikkhus, is called a bhikkhu <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.216</a> who has understood the cessation of the equanimity faculty. He directs his mind accordingly."</p>
