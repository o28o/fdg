<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>"Bhikkhus, these four bases for spiritual power, when developed and cultivated, are of great fruit and benefit.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>"And how, bhikkhus, are the four bases for spiritual power developed and cultivated so that they are of great fruit and benefit?</p>

<p>"Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to desire and volitional formations of striving, thinking: ‘Thus my desire <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.277</a> will be neither too slack nor too tense; and it will be neither constricted internally nor distracted externally.’ And he dwells perceiving after and before: ‘As before, so after; as after, so before; as below, so above; as above, so below; as by day, so at night; as at night, so by day.’ Thus, with a mind that is open and unenveloped, he develops the mind imbued with luminosity.</p>

<p>"He develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to energy … concentration due to mind … concentration due to investigation … he develops the mind imbued with luminosity.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is desire that is too slack? It is desire that is accompanied by lassitude, associated with lassitude.<span class="note" id="n271"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.271] <i>Kosajjasahagata.</i> I usually translate <i>kosajja</i> as laziness, but that seems too strong here. What is intended is a slight dullness or feebleness in the force of desire.</span></span></span> This is called desire that is too slack.</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is desire that is too tense? It is desire that is accompanied by restlessness, associated with restlessness. This is called desire that is too tense.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is desire that is constricted internally? It is desire that is accompanied by sloth and torpor, associated with sloth and torpor. This is called desire that is constricted internally.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is desire that is distracted externally? It is desire that is repeatedly distracted externally, repeatedly disturbed, on account of the five cords of sensual pleasure. This is called desire that is distracted externally.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell perceiving after and before: ‘As before, so after; as after, so before’? <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.278</a> Here, bhikkhus, the perception of after and before is well grasped by a bhikkhu, well attended to, well considered, well penetrated by wisdom. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu dwells perceiving after and before: ‘As before, so after; as after, so before.’<span class="note" id="n272"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.272] <i>Yathā pure tathā pacchā, yathā pacchā tathā pure.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: This should be understood: (i) by way of the meditation subject; and (ii) by way of the teaching. (i) The interpretation (<i>abhinivesa,</i> or "introduction") of the meditation subject is "before" and arahantship is "after." A bhikkhu who, after interpreting the root meditation subject, does not allow the mind to fall into the four undesirable conditions (overly lax, etc.) goes on to attain arahantship; he is called one who dwells "as before, so after." (ii) By way of teaching, the head-hairs are "before" and the brain is "after" (among the solid parts in the contemplation of the body). A bhikkhu who develops his meditation from beginning to end without sliding into the four undesirable conditions is called one who dwells "as before, so after."

<br class="half">The explanation sounds strained. The phrase refers simply to maintaining consistency in attending to the meditation subject in all its aspects throughout the session, from start to finish. See too the use of the phrase in the sentence <i>pacchāpure saññī caṅkamaṁ adhiṭṭheyyāsi</i> (<a href="../an/an7.61.html">AN IV 87,2–3</a>), where it seems to have a spatial meaning: "Percipient of what is behind and in front, you should determine on walking back and forth."</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell ‘as below, so above; as above, so below’? Here, bhikkhus, a bhikkhu reviews this very body upwards from the soles of the feet, downwards from the tips of the hairs, enclosed in skin, as full of many kinds of impurities: ‘There are in this body head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, intestines, mesentery, contents of the stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, grease, saliva, snot, fluid of the joints, urine.’ It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu dwells ‘as below, so above; as above, so below.’</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu dwell ‘as by day, so at night; as at night, so by day’? Here, bhikkhus, at night a bhikkhu develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to desire and volitional formations of striving by way of the same qualities, the same features, the same aspects, as he develops that basis for spiritual power by day. Or else by day he develops the basis for spiritual power that possesses concentration due to desire and volitional formations of striving by way of the same qualities, the same features, the same aspects, as he develops that basis for spiritual power at night. It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu dwells ‘as by day, so at night; as at night, so by day.’</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"And how, bhikkhus, does a bhikkhu, with a mind that is open and unenveloped, develop the mind imbued with luminosity? Here, bhikkhus, the perception of light is well grasped by a bhikkhu; the perception of day is well resolved upon.<span class="note" id="n273"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.273] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: A bhikkhu sits on the terrace attending to the perception of light, sometimes shutting his eyes, sometimes opening them. When (the light) appears to him the same whether his eyes are open or shut, then the perception of light has arisen. Whether it be day or night, if one dispels sloth and torpor with light and attends to one's meditation subject, the perception arisen in regard to the light has been well grasped.</span></span></span> It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu, with a mind that is open and unenveloped, develops the mind imbued with luminosity. <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.279</a></p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is energy that it too slack? It is energy that is accompanied by lassitude, associated with lassitude. This is called energy that is too slack.</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is energy that is too tense? It is energy that is accompanied by restlessness, associated with restlessness. This is called energy that is too tense.</p>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is energy that is constricted internally? It is energy that is accompanied by sloth and torpor, associated with sloth and torpor. This is called energy that is constricted internally.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is energy that is distracted externally? It is energy that is repeatedly distracted externally, repeatedly disturbed, on account of the five cords of sensual pleasure. This is called energy that is distracted externally … <span class="add">all as above</span> …</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is mind that is distracted externally? It is mind that is repeatedly distracted externally, repeatedly disturbed, on account of the five cords of sensual pleasure. This is called mind that is distracted externally … <span class="add">all as above</span> … </p>

<p>"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu, with a mind that is open and unenveloped, develops the mind imbued with luminosity.</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is investigation that is too slack? It is investigation that is accompanied by lassitude, associated with lassitude. This is called investigation that is too slack.</p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is investigation that is too tense? It is investigation that is accompanied by restlessness, associated with restlessness. This is called investigation that is too tense.</p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is investigation that is constricted internally? It is investigation that is accompanied by sloth and torpor, associated with sloth and torpor. This is called investigation that is constricted internally.</p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>"And what, bhikkhus, is investigation that is distracted externally?

<p>"It is in this way, bhikkhus, that a bhikkhu, with a mind that is open and unenveloped, develops the mind imbued with luminosity.</p>

<p>"When, bhikkhus, the four bases for spiritual power have been developed and cultivated in this way, they are of great fruit and benefit.</p>

<p>"When, bhikkhus, the four bases for spiritual power have been developed and cultivated in this way, a bhikkhu wields the various kinds of spiritual power: having been one, he becomes many; having been many, he becomes one … he exercises mastery with the body as far as the brahma world … .</p>

<hr>
<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>"When, bhikkhus, the four bases for spiritual power have been developed and cultivated in this way, a bhikkhu, by the destruction of the taints, <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.281</a> in this very life enters and dwells in the taintless liberation of mind, liberation by wisdom, realizing it for himself with direct knowledge."</p>
