<p>Now on that occasion the chamberlains<span class="note" id="n326"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.326] Though elsewhere <i>thapati</i> evidently means a carpenter, from the description of their duties below it seems these two were royal chamberlains. In Skt literature sthāpatya are often keepers of the women's apartments, and that seems to be their function here. The two are also mentioned as employed in the service of King Pasenadi at <a href="../mn/mn89.html#p10">MN89</a>. According to <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>, at the time Isidatta was a once-returner, Puraṇa a stream-enterer content with his own wife (i.e., not celibate). At <a href="../an/an6.44.html#p2">AN6.44</a>, it is said that after their deaths the Buddha declared them both once-returners reborn in the Tusita heaven; Puraṇa was then celibate, Isidatta content with his own wife.</span></span></span> Isidatta and Puraṇa were residing in Sadhuka on some business. They heard: "A number of bhikkhus, it is said, are making a robe for the Blessed One, thinking that after the three months, with his robe completed, the Blessed One will set out on tour."</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the chamberlains Isidatta and Puraṇa posted a man on the road, telling him: "Good man, when you see the Blessed One coming, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, then you should inform us." After standing for two or three days that man saw the Blessed One coming in the distance. Having seen him, the man approached the chamberlains Isidatta and Puraṇa and told them: "Sirs, this Blessed One is coming, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One. You may come at your own convenience."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Then the chamberlains Isidatta and Puraṇa approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, and followed closely behind him. Then the Blessed One left the road, went to the foot of a tree, and sat down on a seat that was prepared for him. <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.349</a> The chamberlains Isidatta and Puraṇa paid homage to the Blessed One, sat down to one side, and said to him:</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>"Venerable sir, when we hear that the Blessed One will set out from Sāvatthī on tour among the Kosalans, on that occasion there arises in us distress and displeasure at the thought: ‘The Blessed One will be far away from us.’ Then when we hear that the Blessed One has set out from Sāvatthī on tour among the Kosalans, on that occasion there arises in us distress and displeasure at the thought: ‘The Blessed One is far away from us.’</p>

<hr>
<p><span class="parno">5–9</span>"Further, venerable sir, when we hear that the Blessed One will set out from among the Kosalans on tour in the Mallan country … that he has set out from among the Kosalans on tour in the Mallan country … that he will set out from among the Mallans on tour in the Vajjian country … that he has set out from among the Mallans on tour in the Vajjian country … that he will set out from among the Vajjians on tour in the Kasian country … that he has set out from among the Vajjians on tour in the Kasian country … that he will set out from among the Kasians on tour in Magadha, on that occasion there arises in us <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.350</a> distress and displeasure at the thought: ‘The Blessed One will be far away from us.’ Then when we hear that the Blessed One has set out from among the Kasians on tour in Magadha, on that occasion there arises in us great distress and displeasure at the thought: ‘The Blessed One is far away from us.’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>"But, venerable sir, when we hear that the Blessed One will set out from among the Magadhans on tour in the Kasian country, on that occasion there arises in us elation and joy at the thought: ‘The Blessed One will be near to us.’ Then when we hear that the Blessed One has set out from among the Magadhans on tour in the Kasian country, on that occasion there arises in us elation and joy at the thought: ‘The Blessed One is near to us.’</p>

<p><span class="parno">11–13</span>"Further, venerable sir, when we hear that the Blessed One will set out from among the Kasians on tour in the Vajjian country … that he has set out from among the Kasians on tour in the Vajjian country … that he will set out from among the Vajjians on tour in the Mallan country … that he has set out from among the Vajjians on tour in the Mallan country … that he will set out from among the Mallans on tour in Kosala … that he has set out from among the Mallans on tour in Kosala … that he will set out from among the Kosalans on tour to Sāvatthī, on that occasion there arises in us elation and joy at the thought: ‘The Blessed One will be near to us.’ Then, venerable sir, when we hear that the Blessed One is dwelling at Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika's Park, on that occasion there arises in us great elation and joy at the thought: ‘The Blessed One is near to us.’"</p>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>"Therefore, chamberlains, the household life is confinement, a path of dust. The going forth is like the open air. It is enough for you, chamberlains, to be diligent."</p>

<p>"Venerable sir, we are subject to another confinement even more confining and considered more confining than the former one." <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.351</a></p>

<p>"But what, chamberlains, is that other confinement to which you are subject, which is even more confining and considered more confining than the former one?"</p>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"Here, venerable sir, when King Pasenadi of Kosala wants to make an excursion to his pleasure garden, after we have prepared his riding elephants we have to place the king's dear and beloved wives on their seats, one in front and one behind. Now, venerable sir, the scent of those ladies is just like that of a perfumed casket briefly opened; so it is with the royal ladies wearing scent. Also, venerable sir, the bodily touch of those ladies is just like that of a tuft of cotton wool or kapok; so it is with the royal ladies so delicately nurtured. Now on that occasion, venerable sir, the elephants must be guarded, and those ladies must be guarded, and we ourselves must be guarded, yet we do not recall giving rise to an evil state of mind in regard to those ladies. This, venerable sir, is that other confinement to which we are subject, which is even more confining and considered more confining than the former one."</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"Therefore, chamberlains, the household life is confinement, a path of dust. The going forth is like the open air. It is enough for you, chamberlains, to be diligent. The noble disciple, chamberlains, who possesses four things is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"What four? Here, chamberlains, a noble disciple possesses confirmed confidence in the Buddha thus: ‘The Blessed One is … teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ He possesses confirmed confidence in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha. … He dwells at home with a mind devoid of the stain of stinginess, freely generous, open-handed, delighting in relinquishment, one devoted to charity,<span class="note" id="n327"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.327] Here the usual fourth factor of stream-entry, the virtues dear to the noble ones, is replaced by generosity. The terms are commented on at Vism 223–24 (Ppn 7:107–14). On my preference for the reading <i>yājayoga,</i> see I, n. <a href="sn11.11.html#n635">635</a>.</span></span></span> delighting in giving and sharing. A noble disciple who possesses these four things <a class="pts_pn">sn.v.352</a> is a stream-enterer, no longer bound to the nether world, fixed in destiny, with enlightenment as his destination.</p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"Chamberlains, you possess confirmed confidence in the Buddha … in the Dhamma … in the Saṅgha. … Moreover, whatever there is in your family that is suitable for giving, all that you share unreservedly among those who are virtuous and of good character. What do you think, carpenters, how many people are there among the Kosalans who are your equals, that is, in regard to giving and sharing?"</p>
