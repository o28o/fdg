<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Thus have I heard.<span class="note" id="n362"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.362] The incident is also recorded at Vin I 4–7 and <a href="../mn/mn26.html">MN&nbsp;I 167–169</a>, and at <a href="../dn/dn.html#p14">DN II 36–40</a> with the Buddha Vipassī and Mahābrahmā as the speakers. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> assigns the incident to the eighth week after the enlightenment. A BHS parallel at Mvu III 314–19, considerably more ornate, records several variant traditions of the encounter, more or less corresponding with the Pali version; see Jones, 3:302–9.</span></span></span> On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Uruvela on the bank of the river Nerañjara at the foot of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree just after he had become fully enlightened. Then, while the Blessed One was alone in seclusion, a reflection arose in his mind thus: "This Dhamma that I have discovered is deep, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful and sublime, not within the sphere of reasoning, subtle, to be experienced by the wise. But this generation delights in adhesion, takes delight in adhesion, rejoices in adhesion.<span class="note" id="n363"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.363] Spk explains <i>alaya</i> objectively as the five cords of sensual pleasure, called "adhesions" because it is these to which beings adhere; and again, subjectively, as the 108 mental examinations driven by craving <i>(taṇhavicaritani;</i> see <a href="../an/an4.199.html">AN II 212,8–213,2</a>), since it is these that adhere to their objects.</span></span></span> For such a generation this state is hard to see, that is, specific conditionality, dependent origination. And this state too is hard to see, that is, the stilling of all formations, the relinquishment of all acquisitions, the destruction of craving, dispassion, cessation, Nibbāna.<span class="note" id="n364"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.364] Spk: All these terms are synonyms for Nibbāna. For contingent upon that <i>(tam āgamma)</i>, all the vacillations of formations become still and calm down; all acquisitions are relinquished; all cravings are destroyed; all lustful defilements fade away; and all suffering ceases. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk-pṭ:</a> Contingent upon that: in dependence upon that, because it is the object condition for the noble path.</span></span></span> If I were to teach the Dhamma and if others would not understand me, that would be wearisome for me, that would be troublesome."</p>

<p>Thereupon these astounding verses, not heard before in the past, occurred to the Blessed One:<span class="note" id="n365"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.365] The exact meaning of <i>anacchariyā</i> is uncertain. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> (along with other commentaries) offers only a verbal resolution, which is hardly a semantic solution: <i>Anacchariyā ti anuacchariyā</i> (“repeatedly —or according to— <i>acchariyā</i>”). Most translators render it “spontaneously,” apparently taking the stem to be <i>acchara</i> = “moment”; but the commentators seem to understand the stem to be acchariya = “wonderful.”

<br class="half">Spk-pṭ proposes an additional etymology which entails the same meaning: <i>Vuddhippattā vā acchariyā anacchariyā; vuddhi-attho pi hi a-kāro hoti yathā asekkhā dhammā ti;</i> “Or non-wonderful is the wonderful that has increased, for the syllable a (the negative prefix) also signifies what has increased, as in ‘qualities of a non-trainee’ (i.e., of an arahant, ‘one beyond training’).” Though the derivation is problematic, from lack of an alternative I conform to current practice and use “astounding” as the intensification.
 
<br class="half">Spk-pṭ says: “The verses have the quality of ‘astoundingness’ because they indicate that after having fulfilled the perfections <i>(pāramī)</i> for four incalculables and 100,000 aeons for the sake of sharing the Dhamma with the world and its devas, now that he has achieved kingship of the Dhamma he wishes to live at ease. It is this ‘astoundingness’ that is intensified [by the negative prefix <i>an-</i>].”

<br class="half">Von Hinüber contends that <i>anacchariyā</i> represents Skt <i>*an-akṣar-ika</i> (see <i>“Anacchariyā pubbe assutapubbā,”</i> in <i>Selected Papers,</i> pp. 17-24), but his argument rests on the assumption that <i>pubbe assutapubbā</i> would be a redundancy and therefore pubbe must be taken in apposition to the preceding <i>anacchariyā.</i> This assumption, however, is contradicted by <a href="../dn/dn9.html">DN I 184,27-29</a>, where we find <i>pubbe … sutapubbā</i> as one block. Interestingly, no corresponding word is to be found in the Mvu and Lalitavistara versions of the same incident.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p2" class="verse"><span class="parno" id="v556">2</span><span class="add">v.556</span> "Enough now with trying to teach
<br>What I found with so much hardship;
<br>This Dhamma is not easily understood
<br>By those oppressed by lust and hate.</p>

<p id="p3" class="verse"><span class="parno" id="v557">3</span><span class="add">v.557</span> "Those fired by lust, obscured by darkness,
<br>Will never see this abstruse Dhamma,
<br>Deep, hard to see, subtle,
<br>Going against the stream." <a class="pts_pn">sn.i.137</a></p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>As the Blessed One reflected thus, his mind inclined to living at ease, not to teaching the Dhamma.<span class="note" id="n366"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.366] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Living at ease (<i>appossukkata,</i> lit. "little zeal") means lack of desire to teach. But why did his mind so incline after he had made the aspiration to Buddhahood, fulfilled the perfections, and attained omniscience? Because as he reflected, the density of the defilements of beings and the profundity of the Dhamma became manifest to him. Also, he knew that if he inclined to living at ease, Brahma would request him to teach, and since beings esteem Brahma, this would instill in them a desire to hear the Dhamma. On <i>ussukka,</i> see n. <a href="sn1.28html#n54">54</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Then Brahma Sahampati, having known with his own mind the reflection in the Blessed One's mind, thought: "Alas, the world is lost! Alas, the world is to perish, in that the mind of the Tathāgata, the Arahant, the Perfectly Enlightened One, inclines to living at ease, not to teaching the Dhamma."<span class="note" id="n367"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.367] Brahma Sahampati appears in dramatic roles at key points in the Buddha’s ministry and also utters the first verse at his parinibbāna (v. <a href="sn6.15.html#v608">608</a> below). See <a href="sn48.57.html">SN48.57</a> for his own account of how he become a prominent deity in the brahma world. His other appearances in SN are at: <a href="sn6.2.html">SN6.2</a>, <a href="#6.3">3</a>, <a href="#6.10">10</a>, <a href="#6.12">12</a>, <a href="#6.13">13</a>; <a href="sn11.17.html">SN11.17</a>; <a href="sn22.80.html">SN22.80</a>; <a href="sn47.18.html">SN47.18</a>, <a href="sn47.43.html">43</a>. In the Mvu version the deity who arrives is referred to simply as Mahābrahmā, without a personal name. He comes accompanied by many other gods including Sakka.

<br class="half">In this chapter <i>(and elsewhere in this translation)</i>, I use "Brahma" when the word is part of a proper name and "brahma" when it refers more generally to a being or class of beings. Sometimes there is no hard and fast boundary between the two.</span></span></span> Then, just as quickly as a strong man might extend his drawn-in arm or draw in his extended arm, Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the brahma world and reappeared before the Blessed One. He arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, knelt down with his right knee on the ground, raised his joined hands in reverential salutation towards the Blessed One, and said to him: "Venerable sir, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma; let the Fortunate One teach the Dhamma. There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma."</p>

<p>This is what Brahma Sahampati said. Having said this, he further said this:</p>

<p id="p6" class="verse"><span class="parno" id="v558">6</span><span class="add">v.558</span> "In the past there appeared among the Magadhans
<br>An impure Dhamma devised by those still stained.
<br>Throw open this door to the Deathless! Let them hear
<br>The Dhamma that the Stainless One discovered.<span class="note" id="n368"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.368] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> identifies the door to the Deathless <i>(amatassa dvara)</i> with the noble path, "the door to the deathless Nibbāna." Although the text here uses the singular <i>dvara,</i> just below it has the plural <i>dvara.</i></span></span></span></p>

<p id="p7" class="verse"><span class="parno" id="v559">7</span><span class="add">v.559</span> "Just as one standing on a mountain peak

<br>So, O wise one, universal eye,

<br>Being yourself free from sorrow, behold the people
<br>Submerged in sorrow, oppressed by birth and decay.</p>

<p id="p8" class="verse"><span class="parno" id="v560">8</span><span class="add">v.560</span> "Rise up, O hero, victor in battle!
<br>O caravan leader, debt-free one, wander in the world.
<br>Teach the Dhamma, O Blessed One:

Ee1 <i>desetu</i> <i>(found also in the&nbsp;DN and Vin parallels)</i> seems to be a normalization influenced by the preceding prose passage. The verse is recited again by Brahma Sahampati at v. <a href="sn11.17.html#v919">919.</a> The Buddha is called the "unsurpassed caravan leader" at v. <a href="sn8.7.html#v736">736b</a>; see n. <a href="sn8.7.html#n517">517</a>.</span></span></span> <a class="pts_pn">sn.i.138</a></p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Then the Blessed One, having understood Brahma's request, out of compassion for beings surveyed the world with the eye of a Buddha.<span class="note" id="n370"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.370] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: The eye of a Buddha <i>(buddhacakkhu)</i> is a name for the knowledge of the degrees of maturity in the faculties of beings <i>(indriyaparopariyattañāṇa)</i> and the knowledge of the dispositions and underlying tendencies of beings <i>(asayanusayañāṇa)</i>. The knowledge of omniscience is called the universal eye (<i>samantacakkhu,</i> at v. <a href="sn6.1.html#v559">559d</a>). The knowledge of the three lower paths is called the Dhamma eye (or "vision of Dhamma," <i>dhammacakkhu</i>). Together with the divine eye (<i>dibbacakkhu:</i> see <a href="sn6.5.html">SN6.5</a>, <a href="sn6.html#6.12">12</a>:70) and the fleshly eye <i>(mamsacakkhu)</i>, these make up the "five eyes" of a Buddha.</span></span></span> As he did so, the Blessed One saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with keen faculties and with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and difficult to teach, and a few who dwelt seeing blame and fear in the other world.<span class="note" id="n371"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.371] <i>Paralokavajjabhayadassavino.</i> At MLDB, p. 261, the ambiguous compound is rendered "seeing fear in blame and in the other world." This agrees well enough with the commentaries, which resolve it: <i>paralokañ c’ eva vajjañ ca bhaya-to passanti.</i> At <a href="../dhp/dhp306-319.html#p317">Dhp 317–18</a>, however, <i>bhaya</i> and <i>vajja</i> are treated as parallel terms, which suggests that the compound should be resolved:<i> paraloke vajjañ c’ eva bhayañ ca passanti.</i></span></span></span> Just as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses, some lotuses might be born in the water, grow up in the water, and thrive while submerged in the water, without rising up from the water; some lotuses might be born in the water, grow up in the water, and stand at an even level with the water; some lotuses might be born in the water and grow up in the water, but would rise up from the water and stand without being soiled by the water—so too, surveying the world with the eye of a Buddha, the Blessed One saw beings with little dust in their eyes and with much dust in their eyes, with keen faculties and with dull faculties, with good qualities and with bad qualities, easy to teach and hard to teach, and a few who dwelt seeing blame and fear in the other world.</p>

<p>Having seen this, he answered Brahma Sahampati in verse:</p>

<p id="p10" class="verse"><span class="parno" id="v561">10</span><span class="add">v.561</span> "Open to them are the doors to the Deathless:
<br>Let those who have ears release faith.
<br>Foreseeing trouble, O Brahma, I did not speak
<br>The refined, sublime Dhamma among human beings."</p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Then Brahma Sahampati, thinking, "The Blessed One has given his consent <span class="add">to my request</span> regarding the teaching of the Dhamma," paid homage to the Blessed One and disappeared right there.<span class="note" id="n372"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.372] <i>Katavakaso kho ’mhi bhagavata dhammadesanaya.</i> <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Ee1</a> <i>bhagavato</i> here must be an error. At MLDB, p. 262, in accordance with prevalent practice this phrase was rendered, "I have created the opportunity for the Blessed One to teach the Dhamma." CPD <i>(s.v. <i>katavakasa</i>)</i> remarks that this construal "is both grammatically impossible and contextually unlikely." The rendering here, based on a suggestion of VĀT, uses the active voice in place of an awkward passive construction imitative of the Pali.</span></span></span></p>
