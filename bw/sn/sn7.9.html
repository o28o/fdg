<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kosalans on the bank of the river Sundarika. Now on that occasion the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja was offering a fire sacrifice and performing the fire oblation on the bank of the river Sundarika. Then the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja, having offered the fire sacrifice and performed the fire oblation, rose from his seat and surveyed the four quarters all around, wondering: "Who now might eat this sacrificial cake?"<span class="note" id="n447"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.447] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: This was his thought: "The portion of milk-rice placed in the fire has been eaten by Mahābrahmā. If this remainder is given to a brahmin, one born from the mouth of Brahma, my father and son would be pleased and I will clear the path to the brahma world." See Deussen, <i>Sixty Upaniṣads of the Veda,</i> SN1.148: "The residue <i>(ucchiṣṭaṁ)</i> of the offering, i.e., what remains in the ladle, in the saucepan, or vessel, is to be eaten only by a brahmaṇa, not in his own house; no kṣatriya or vaiśya is to eat it." This explains why the brahmin, just below, is so concerned about the Buddha’s caste.</span></span></span></p>

<p>The brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja saw the Blessed One sitting at the foot of a tree with his head covered. Having seen him, he took the sacrificial cake in his left hand and the waterpot in his right hand and approached the Blessed One. When the Blessed One heard the sound of the brahmin's footsteps, he uncovered his head. Then the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja, thinking, "This worthy is shaven-headed, <a class="pts_pn">sn.i.168</a> this worthy is a shaveling," wanted to turn back; but it occurred to him: "Some brahmins here are also shaven-headed. Let me approach him and inquire about his birth."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Then the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja approached the Blessed One and said to him: "What is the worthy one's birth?"</p>

<p><span class="add">The Blessed One:</span></p>

<p id="p3" class="verse"><span class="parno" id="v638">3</span><span class="add">v.638</span> "Ask not of birth but ask of conduct:
<br>Fire is indeed produced from any wood.
<br>A resolute sage, though from low family,
<br>Is a thoroughbred restrained by a sense of shame.<span class="note" id="n448"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.448] Fire is indeed produced from any wood <i>(kaṭṭhā have jāyati jātavedo)</i>. <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: This is the purport: "It is not the case that only fire produced from a pure type of wood, such as sal-tree logs, can perform the work of fire, but not fire produced from the wood of a dog's trough, etc. Rather, by reason of its flame, etc., fire produced from any kind of wood can do the work of fire. So you should not think that only one born in a brahmin family is worthy of offerings, but not one born in a caṇḍala family, etc. Whether from a low family or a high family, an arahant sage is a thoroughbred—resolute, restrained by a sense of shame." See in this connection the arguments at <a href="../mn/mn90.html">MN&nbsp;II 129–30</a>, <a href="../mn/mn93.html">151–53</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<br>To one worthy of offerings."<span class="note" id="n449"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.449] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a> explains one who has reached the end of knowledge <i>(vedantagū)</i> in pāda b thus: "one gone to the end of the four path knowledges, or one gone to the end of defilements by the four path knowledges" <i>(catunnaṁ maggavedanaṁ antaṁ, catūhi va maggavedehi kilesanaṁ antaṁ gato)</i>. Evidently, the Buddha is here deliberately using brahmanical terminology in order to adjust the Dhamma to the mental disposition of the brahmin.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span class="add">The brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja:</span></p>

<br>This, brahmin, is not the principle
<br>Observed by those who see.
<br>The Enlightened Ones reject such food
<br>Over which verses have been sung.
<br>As such a principle exists, O brahmin,
<br>This is their rule of conduct.</p>

<p id="p8" class="verse"><span class="parno" id="v642">8</span><span class="add">v.642</span> "Serve with other food and drink

<hr>
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>"Then, Master Gotama, should I give this sacrificial cake to someone else?"</p>

<p>"I do not see anyone, brahmin, in this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahma, in this generation with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, who could eat and properly digest this sacrificial cake <a class="pts_pn">sn.i.169</a> except the Tathāgata or a disciple of the Tathāgata.<span class="note" id="n450"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.450] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: Why does he say this? It is said that when the brahmin presented the food to the Buddha, the devas from the four world-regions, etc., suffused the food with nutritive essence <i>(oja)</i> produced by their celestial power. Thus it became extremely subtle. It was too subtle for the coarse digestive systems of ordinary human beings to digest properly; yet, because the food had a base of coarse material food, it was too coarse for the devas to digest. Even dry-insight arahants could not digest it. Only arahants who obtain the eight meditative attainments could digest it by the power of their attainment, while the Blessed One could digest it by his own natural digestive power.</span></span></span> Therefore, brahmin, throw away the sacrificial cake in a place where there is sparse vegetation or dispose of it in water where there are no living beings."</p>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>Then the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja disposed of that sacrificial cake in water where there were no living beings. When it was disposed of in the water, that sacrificial cake sizzled and hissed and gave off steam and smoke.<span class="note" id="n451"><span class="details"><span class="p">[n.451] <a href="sn0-abbr.html" title="Abbreviations">Spk</a>: This did not occur through the power of the food itself but through the Buddha’s power. The Buddha had made such a determination so that the brahmin would be favourably disposed to hear the Dhamma.</span></span></span> Just as a ploughshare, heated all day, sizzles and hisses and gives off steam and smoke if placed in water, so too that sacrificial cake, when disposed of in the water, sizzled and hissed and gave off steam and smoke.</p>

<hr>
<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Then the brahmin Sundarika Bharadvaja, shocked and terrified, approached the Blessed One and stood to one side. The Blessed One then addressed him with verses:</p>

The lake is limpid <i>(anāvila)</i> because, unlike your river which becomes muddy when four or five bathe in it at the same time, the lake of the Dhamma remains limpid and clear even when hundreds of thousands enter it to bathe." On "the bath without water," see v. <a href="sn1.58.html#v198">198ef</a> and n. <a href="sn1.58.html#n119">119</a>.</span></span></span></p>

Spk explains <i>brahmacariya</i> as if it were equivalent to the entire eightfold path <i>(magga-brahmacariya)</i>, but it seems more likely that here the term was originally intended in the specific sense of celibacy, to be understood as a fourth item alongside the preceding three and not as an umbrella term comprising them.</span>
