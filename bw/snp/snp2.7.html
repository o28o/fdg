<h2>2:7 The Traditions of The Brahmnins</h2>

<p>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then some affluent brahmins of Kosala &mdash; old, aged, burdened with years, advanced in life, come to the last stage &mdash; approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side and said to the Blessed One:</p>

<p>“Master Gotama, are the brahmins presently seen observing the brahmanical tradition of the ancient brahmins?”</p>

<p>“Brahmins, the brahmins are not presently seen observing the brahmanical tradition of the ancient brahmins.”</p>

<p>“Please let Master Gotama speak about the brahmanical tradition of the ancient brahmins, if it would not be an imposition.”</p>

<p>“In that case, brahmins, listen and attend closely. I will speak.”</p>

<p>Those affluent brahmins replied: “Yes, sir.” The Blessed One said this:</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">284</span>“The rishis of the past<br>
controlled themselves and were austere;<br>
having abandoned the five strands of sense pleasures,<br>
they practiced for their own good. (1) [51]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">285</span>“The brahmins did not own cattle,<br>
nor did they keep bullion and grain.<br>
They had study as their wealth and grain;<br>
they guarded a divine treasure. (2)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">286</span>“Whatever was prepared for them,<br>
such food was placed at their doors.<br>
People thought what was prepared in faith<br>
should be given to those who sought it. (3)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">287</span>“With cloths dyed various colors,<br>
with bedding, and with dwellings,<br>
[those from] prosperous provinces and realms<br>
paid homage to those brahmins. (4)</p>

<p class="verse">
<span class ="parno">288</span>“The brahmins were inviolable,<br>
unconquerable, protected by Dhamma.<br>
No one at all obstructed them in any way<br>
at the doors of their homes. (5)</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><br>
<span class ="parno">289</span>“For forty-eight years they observed<br>
the spiritual life of virginal celibacy.<br>
The brahmins in the past pursued<br>
the quest for knowledge and conduct. (6)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">290</span>“The brahmins did not marry outside,<br>
nor did they purchase a wife.<br>
Having united through affection,<br>
they agreed to dwell together. (7)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">291</span>“Apart from that occasion,<br>
after her fertile season was over,<br>
the brahmins never went to her<br>
for sexual intercourse during the interval. (8)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">292</span>“They praised the spiritual life<br>
of celibacy and good behavior,<br>
rectitude, mildness, and austerity,<br>
gentleness, harmlessness, and patience. (9) [52]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">293</span>“He who was supreme among them &mdash;<br>
the brahmin firm in his exertion &mdash;<br>
did not engage in sex,<br>
even in a dream. (10)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">294</span>“Training in accordance with his practice,<br>
others here of intelligent disposition<br>
praised the spiritual life of celibacy<br>
as well as good behavior and patience. (11)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">295</span>“Having requested rice,<br>
bedding, clothes, ghee, and oil,<br>
having righteously collected them,<br>
they then performed sacrifice.<br>
But at the sacrifice that was arranged,<br>
they did not slaughter cattle.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> includes the last couplet here in the following verse, but I follow <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span> and <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span>.</span></span></span> (12)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">296</span>“Like a mother, father, brother,<br>
or any other relatives,<br>
cows are our supreme friends,<br>
since medicines are produced in them. (13)</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">297</span>“They give food and strength,<br>
and so too beauty and happiness.<br>
Having recognized this benefit,<br>
they did not slaughter cattle. (14)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">298</span>“Delicate, with large bodies,<br>
handsome, and glorious, the brahmins<br>
were keen on what was to be done and not done<br>
according to their own traditions.<br>
As long as these continued in the world,<br>
this population happily flourished. (15)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">299</span>“But an inversion took place in them:<br>
having [previously] seen the slight as slight,<br>
they saw the splendor of the king<br>
and lavishly adorned women, (16)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">300</span>“chariots yoked with thoroughbreds,<br>
well made, with colorful coverings,<br>
abodes and residences that were<br>
designed and measured in proportion. (17)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">301</span>“The brahmins then coveted<br>
abundant human wealth<br>
accompanied by herds of cattle,<br>
and groups of resplendent women. (18)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">302</span>“Having composed hymns to that end,<br>
they then approached Okkāka and said: [53]<br>
‘You have abundant wealth and grain.<br>
Sacrifice, you have much treasure;<br>
sacrifice, you have much wealth.’ (19)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">303</span>“And then, convinced by the brahmins,<br>
the king, lord of charioteers,<br>
had these sacrifices performed:<br>
the horse sacrifice, the man sacrifice,<br>
the <i>sammāpāsa</i>, <i>vācapeyya</i>, and <i>niragga</i><i>ḷ</i><i>a</i>.<br>
He then gave wealth to the brahmins: (20)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">304</span>“cattle and bedding and clothes<br>
and lavishly adorned women;<br>
chariots yoked with thoroughbreds,<br>
well made, with variegated coverings; (21)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">305</span>“residences that were delightful<br>
and well designed in proportion.<br>
Having filled them with various kinds of grain,<br>
he gave this wealth to the brahmins. (22)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">306</span>“Having obtained wealth there,<br>
they agreed to store it up.<br>
As they fell under the control of desire,<br>
their craving increased still more.<br>
Having composed hymns for this purpose,<br>
they again approached Okkāka and said: (23)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">307</span>“‘Like water and the earth<br>
like bullion, wealth, and grain,<br>
just so are cattle [useful] to people,<br>
for they are requisites of living beings.<br>
Sacrifice, you have much treasure;<br>
sacrifice, you have much wealth.’ (24)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">308</span>“And then the king, lord of charioteers,<br>
convinced by the brahmins,<br>
had many hundreds and thousands of cows<br>
slaughtered in sacrifice. (25)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">309</span>“They did not harm anyone in any way &mdash;<br>
not with their feet or their horns.<br>
The cows were as mild as lambs,<br>
giving buckets of milk.<br>
But having grabbed their horns,<br>
the king slew them with a knife. (26) [54]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">310</span>“Then the devas and the fathers,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Reading with <span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> <i>tato devā pitaro ca</i>, also adopted by Norman and apparently supported by <span class="var" title="Paramatthajotikā II (Suttanipāta-aṭṭhakathā)">Pj II</span>.</span></span></span><br>
Indra, the asuras, and rakkhasas,<br>
cried out, ‘How unrighteous!’<br>
because the knife struck a cow. (27)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">311</span>“Formerly there were three illnesses:<br>
desire, hunger, and old age.<br>
But because of the slaughter of cattle,<br>
there came to be ninety-eight. (28)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">312</span>“This unrighteousness by violence<br>
has come down as an ancient custom.<br>
They kill the harmless creatures;<br>
the sacrificers fall from righteousness. (29)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">313</span>“In such a way this mean practice,<br>
though ancient, is censured by the wise.<br>
Wherever they see such a thing,<br>
people censure the sacrificer. (30)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">314</span>“When the Dhamma had thus been lost,<br>
suddas and vessas were divided.<br>
Numerous khattiyas were divided;<br>
the wife despised her husband.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Reading <i>patiṃ bhariy</i><i>ā’</i><i>vama</i><i>ññatha</i><span>.</span></span></span></span> (31)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">315</span>“Khattiyas and Brahmā’s kinsmen,<br>
and others protected by their clan,<br>
disregarding the doctrine of birth,<br>
have come under the control of sensual pleasures.” (32)</p>

<hr>

<p>When this was said, those affluent brahmins said this to the Blessed One: “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. We now go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, [55] and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. Let Master Gotama consider us lay followers who from today have gone for refuge for life.”</p>
