<h2>3:10 Kokāliya</h2>

<p>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Sāvatthī in Jeta’s Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Then the bhikkhu Kokālika approached the Blessed One, [124] paid homage to him, sat down to one side, and said: “Bhante, Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires; they have come under the control of evil desires.”</p>

<p>When this was said, the Blessed One said to the bhikkhu Kokālika: “Do not say so, Kokālika! Do not say so, Kokālika! Be pleased with Sāriputta and Moggallāna, Kokālika. Sāriputta and Moggallāna are virtuous.”</p>

<hr>

<p>A second time the bhikkhu Kokālika said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, although the Blessed One has my faith and trust, still [I say] Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires; they have come under the control of evil desires.” And a second time the Blessed One said to the bhikkhu Kokālika: “Do not say so, Kokālika! . . . Sāriputta and Moggallāna are virtuous.”</p>

<p>A third time the bhikkhu Kokālika said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, although the Blessed One has my faith and trust, still [I say] Sāriputta and Moggallāna have evil desires; they have come under the control of evil desires.” And a third time the Blessed One said to the bhikkhu Kokālika: “Do not say so, Kokālika! . . . Sāriputta and Moggallāna are virtuous.”</p>

<p>Then the bhikkhu Kokālika rose from his seat, paid homage to the Blessed One, and departed, keeping him on his right. Not long after the bhikkhu Kokālika left, his entire body became covered with boils the size of mustard seeds. Having been the size of mustard seeds, these then grew to the size of <a id="calibre_link-1247" class="calibre1"></a>mung beans; then to the size of chickpeas; then to the size of jujube pits; [125] then to the size of jujube fruits; then to the size of an <i>āmalaka</i> fruit;<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The <i>ā</i><i>malaka</i> (Sinhala, <i>artalu</i>), or myrobalan, is a medicinal fruit roughly the size of an olive.</span></span></span> then to the size of unripe <i>beḷuva</i> fruits; then to the size of ripe <i>beḷuva</i> fruits.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The <i>beḷuva</i> (Sinhala, <i>belli</i>) is a hard-shelled fruit that can grow to the size of a large orange.</span></span></span> When they had grown to the size of ripe <i>beḷuva</i> fruits, they burst open and oozed pus and blood. Then, because of that illness, the bhikkhu Kokālika died and, as a result of harboring animosity toward Sāriputta and Moggallāna, he was reborn in the Paduma hell.</p>

<p>Then, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sahampati, of stunning beauty, illuminating the entire Jeta’s Grove, approached the Blessed One, paid homage to him, stood to one side, and said to him: “Bhante, the bhikkhu Kokālika has died and, as a result of harboring animosity toward Sāriputta and Moggallāna, he was reborn in the Paduma hell.” This is what Brahmā Sahampati said. Having said this, he paid homage to the Blessed One and, keeping him on his right, he disappeared right there.</p>

<p>Then, when the night had passed, the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: “Bhikkhus, last night, when the night had advanced, Brahmā Sahampati approached me and said to me: ‘Bhante, the bhikkhu Kokālika has died and, as a result of harboring animosity toward Sāriputta and Moggallāna, he was reborn in the Paduma hell.’ Having said this, he paid homage to me and, keeping me on his right, he disappeared right there.”</p>

<p>When this was said, a certain bhikkhu [126] said to the Blessed One: “Bhante, how long is the life span in the Paduma hell?”</p>

<hr>

<p>“The life span in the Paduma hell is long, bhikkhu. It is not easy to count it and say it is so many years, or so many hundreds of years, or so many thousands of years, or so many hundreds of thousands of years.”</p>

<p>“Then is it possible to give a simile, Bhante?”</p>

<p>“It is possible, bhikkhu. Suppose there was a Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesamum seed. At the end of every hundred years a man would remove from it a single seed. That Kosalan cartload of twenty measures of sesamum seed might in this way be depleted and exhausted more quickly than a single Abbuda hell would go by. Twenty Abbuda hells are the equivalent of one Nirabbuda hell; twenty Nirabbuda hells are the equivalent of one Ababa hell; twenty Ababa hells are <a id="calibre_link-5696" class="calibre1"></a>the equivalent of one Ahaha hell; twenty Ahaha hells are the equivalent of one Aṭaṭa hell; twenty Aṭaṭa hells are the equivalent of one Kumuda hell; twenty Kumuda hells are the equivalent of one Sogandhika hell; twenty Sogandhika hells are the equivalent of one Uppalaka hell; twenty Uppalaka hells are the equivalent of one Puṇḍarīka hell; and twenty Puṇḍarīka hells are the equivalent of one Paduma hell. Now, as a result of harboring animosity toward Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the bhikkhu Kokālika has been reborn in the Paduma hell.”</p>

<p>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this: [127]</p>
