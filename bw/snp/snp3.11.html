<h2>3:11 Nālaka</h2>
<p>Introductory verses</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">679</span>The rishi Asita, while passing the day,<br>
saw the Tāvatiṃsa devas, joyful and ecstatic.<br>
Having honored Indra, clad in clean garments,<br>
carrying streamers, they were proclaiming exuberant praise. (1) [132]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">680</span>Having seen the devas exultant and elated,<br>
having shown them respect, he said this to them:<br>
“For what reason is the group of devas exuberantly jubilant?<br>
Why do you take streamers and swirl them around? (2)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">681</span>“Even when there was a battle with the asuras,<br>
when the gods were victorious and the asuras defeated,<br>
even then there was no such excitement.<br>
What wonder have the gods seen that they rejoice? (3)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">682</span>“They whistle and sing and play music;<br>
they clap their arms and dance around.<br>
I ask you, dwellers on Mount Meru’s peak:<br>
dear sirs, quickly dispel my bafflement.” (4)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">683</span>“In Lumbinī, a village in the Sakyan country,<br>
the Bodhisatta &mdash; the excellent gem, unequaled &mdash; has been born<br>
into the human world for well-being and happiness;<br>
hence we are so delighted and extremely jubilant. (5)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">684</span>“He is the best of all beings, the foremost person,<br>
the chief bull of men, the best of all creatures. [133]<br>
He will turn the wheel in the grove named for the rishis,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i>Isivhaye vane</i>. This alludes to Isipatana, where the Buddha gave his first discourse.</span></span></span><br>
roaring like a powerful lion, the lord of beasts.” (6)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">685</span>Having heard that utterance, he quickly descended,<br>
and then approached the residence of Suddhodana.<br>
Having sat down there, he said to the Sakyans:<br>
“Where is the prince? I too wish to see him.” (7)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">686</span>Then the Sakyans showed Asita their son,<br>
who was radiant with splendor and of perfect color;<br>
the prince shone like gold burnished<br>
in the mouth of a furnace by one highly skilled. (8)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">687</span>Having seen the prince blazing like a crested flame,<br>
pure like the moon, lord of stars, moving in the sky,<br>
like the beaming autumn sun freed from clouds,<br>
already delighted, he gained abundant joy. (9)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">688</span>The gods held up a parasol in the sky<br>
with multiple ribs and a thousand circles.<br>
Golden-handled chowries moved up and down,<br>
but none were seen holding the chowries or parasol. (10) [134]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">689</span>The matted-hair rishi named “Black Glory,”<br>
having seen him like a gold nugget on a red blanket,<br>
with the white parasol being held over his head,<br>
received him, elated and happy. (11)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">690</span>Then, having received the Sakyan bull,<br>
examining him, the master of marks and hymns<br>
was pleased in mind and emitted a cry:<br>
“He is unsurpassed, the best of bipeds.” (12)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">691</span>Then, recollecting his own departure,<br>
he became dismayed and shed bitter tears.<br>
Seeing this, the Sakyans asked the weeping rishi:<br>
“Will some misfortune befall the prince?” (13)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">692</span>Seeing the Sakyans dismayed, the rishi said:<br>
“I do not foresee harm for the prince.<br>
There will be no obstacle for him,<br>
not the least, so set your minds at ease. (14)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">693</span>“This prince will reach the foremost enlightenment;<br>
one of supremely purified sight, compassionate for many people,<br>
he will set in motion the wheel of the Dhamma;<br>
his spiritual life will become widespread. (15) [135]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">694</span>“But the remainder of my life here is not long;<br>
my death will occur in the interval.<br>
I will not hear the Dhamma of the one unequaled in fortitude.<br>
Hence I am troubled, distressed, and dejected.” (16)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">695</span>Having brought the Sakyans abundant joy,<br>
the holy man left the palace.<br>
Out of compassion for his own nephew,<br>
he enjoined him in the Dhamma<br>
of the one unequaled in fortitude. (17)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">696</span>“When you hear from another the word ‘buddha,’<br>
[and] ‘one who attained enlightenment<br>
reveals<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Reading <i>vivarati</i> with <span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> as against <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span> and <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> <i>vicarati</i>.</span></span></span> the foremost Dhamma,’<br>
having gone to him, asking about his doctrine,<br>
lead the spiritual life under that Blessed One.” (18)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">697</span>Instructed by such a one with benevolent mind,<br>
whose vision of the future was supremely purified,<br>
Nālaka, one with a store of accumulated merit,<br>
expecting the Conqueror, dwelled with guarded faculties. (19)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">698</span>Having heard the word about the Conqueror<br>
setting in motion the excellent wheel [of the Dhamma],<br>
having gone, he saw the chief rishi and was pleased. [136]<br>
Since [the time for] Asita’s instruction had arrived,<br>
he asked the excellent muni about supreme munihood. (20)</p>

<hr>

<p>[The instruction]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">699</span>“This statement of Asita<br>
has been known by me to be true to fact.<br>
Therefore I ask you, O Gotama,<br>
one who has gone beyond all phenomena. (21)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">700</span>“Since I have entered the homeless life,<br>
seeking sustenance on alms round,<br>
being asked, O muni, please explain to me<br>
munihood, the ultimate way.” (22)</p>

<p><strong>(The Blessed One said)</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">701</span>“I will describe munihood to you,”<br>
“hard to practice and hard to master.<br>
Come, I will tell you about it &mdash;<br>
brace yourself and be firm. (23)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">702</span>“One should have the same attitude<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> and <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span> read <i>sam</i><i>ā</i><i>nabh</i><i>ā</i><i>gaṃ</i>, as against <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> <i>sam</i><i>ā</i><i>nabh</i><i>ā</i><i>vaṃ</i>.

whether one is insulted or venerated in the village.<br>
One should guard against anger in the mind;<br>
one should keep calm, without being elated. (24) [137]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">703</span>“Diverse impressions high and low<br>
come forth like flames in a forest.<br>
Women try to seduce a muni &mdash;<br>
do not let them seduce you! (25)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">704</span>“Refraining from sexual intercourse,<br>
having given up sensual pleasures fine and coarse;<br>
one should not be hostile or attached<br>
to living beings both frail and firm. (26)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">705</span>“[Reflecting] ‘As I am, so are they;<br>
as they are, so am I,’<br>
having taken oneself as the criterion,<br>
one should not kill or cause others to kill. (27)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">706</span>“Having given up desire and greed<br>
for that to which the worldling is attached,<br>
one with vision should practice<br>
so that one may cross this inferno. (28)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">707</span>“Not filling one’s belly, moderate in food,<br>
one should be of few desires, without longing.<br>
One is hungerless with respect to desire;<br>
desireless, one is quenched. (29)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">708</span>“Having wandered on alms round,<br>
he should resort to the woods.<br>
Staying at the foot of a tree,<br>
the muni should take his seat. (30)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">709</span>“That steadfast one intent on jhāna<br>
should take delight in the woods.<br>
He should meditate at the foot of a tree,<br>
making himself fully content. (31)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">710</span>“Then, with the passing of the night,<br>
he should approach the village.<br>
He should not welcome invitations<br>
and offerings brought from the village. (32)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">711</span>“When the muni has come to the village,<br>
he should not behave rashly among families.<br>
Having cut off talk aimed at getting food,<br>
he should not utter suggestive words. (33)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">712</span>“‘I received something, that is good;<br>
I received nothing, that is fine.’<br>
In both situations remaining impartial,<br>
he returns to the tree itself. (34) [138]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">713</span>“Wandering with bowl in hand,<br>
not dumb though considered dumb,<br>
one should not scorn a small offering<br>
nor should one despise the giver. (35)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">714</span>“High and low is the practice<br>
taught by the Ascetic.<br>
They do not go in two ways to the far shore;<br>
[yet] it is not experienced in a single way. (36)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">715</span>“For one who has no diffusion,<br>
for a bhikkhu who has cut off the stream,<br>
who has abandoned what is to be done and not done,<br>
no fever [of defilements] exists. (37)</p>

<p><strong>(The Blessed One said)</strong></p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">716</span>“I will describe munihood to you,”<br>
“One should treat it like the blade of a razor.<br>
Having pressed one’s palate with the tongue,<br>
exert control over one’s belly. (38)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">717</span>“One should not be sluggish in mind,<br>
nor should one ponder much.<br>
Be unpolluted, unattached,<br>
with the spiritual life as one’s support. (39)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">718</span>“One should train in a solitary seat<br>
and in the exercise of an ascetic.<br>
It is solitude that is called munihood.<br>
If you will delight alone,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">I read pāda d <i>eko ce abhiramissasi</i> with <span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> and <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span>.</span></span></span><br>

Either way we would wind up with an irregular verse of five lines.</span></span></span> (40)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">719</span>“Having heard the acclaim of the wise,<br>
of the meditators who have renounced sensual pleasures,<br>
my follower should develop even more<br>
a sense of moral shame and faith. (41) [139]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">720</span>“Understand this by way of rivers<br>
and in terms of clefts and ravines.<br>
The creeks flow on noisily,<br>
but silently the great rivers flow. (42)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">721</span>“What is empty makes a noise;<br>
what is full is ever quiet.<br>
The fool is like a half-full barrel,<br>
the wise man like a full lake. (43)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">722</span>“When the Ascetic speaks much,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">As <span class="var" title="Paramatthajotikā II (Suttanipāta-aṭṭhakathā)">Pj II</span> explains, <i>samaṇo</i> here refers to the Buddha.</span></span></span><br>
it is meaningful and beneficial.<br>
Knowing, he teaches the Dhamma;<br>
knowing, he speaks much. (44)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">723</span>“But one who, knowing, is self-controlled,<br>
who, knowing, does not speak much:<br>
that muni is worthy of munihood;<br>
that muni has achieved munihood.” (45)</p>
