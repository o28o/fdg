<p><span class="speaker">Narrator</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p679"><span class="parno">679</span>
			The hermit Asita in his daily meditation 
			<br>saw the bright-clad gods of the Thirty-Three 
			<br>and their lord Sakka joyfully celebrating, 
			<br>waving streamers in exuberant exaltation. </p>
			
			<p id="p680"><span class="parno">680</span>
			Seeing the gods rejoicing, elated, 
			<br>he paid respects and said this there: 
			<br>“Why is the community of gods in such excellent spirits? 
			<br>Why take up streamers and whirl them about? </p>
			</div>

<hr>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p681"><span class="parno">681</span>
			Even in the war with the demons, 
			<br>when gods were victorious and demons defeated, 
			<br>there was no such excitement. 
			<br>What marvel have the celestials seen that they so rejoice? </p>
			
			
			<p id="p682"><span class="parno">682</span>
			Shouting and singing and playing music, 
			<br>they clap their hands and dance. 
			<br>I ask you, dwellers on Mount Meru’s peak, 
			<br>quickly dispel my doubt, good sirs!” </p>
	</div>

<hr>

<p><span class="speaker">Devas</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p><span class="parno">683</span>
			“The being intent on awakening, a peerless gem, 
			<br>has been born in the human realm for the sake of welfare and happiness, 
			<br>in Lumbinī, a village in the Sakyan land. 
			<br>That’s why we’re so happy, in such excellent spirits. </p>
			
			<p id="p684"><span class="parno">684</span>
			He is supreme among all beings, the best of people, 
			<br>a bull among men, supreme among all creatures. 
			<br>He will roll forth the wheel in the grove of the hermits, 
			<br>roaring like a mighty lion, lord of beasts.” </p>
	</div>


<hr>

<p><span class="speaker">Narrator</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p><span class="parno">685</span>
			Hearing this, he swiftly descended 
			<br>and right away approached Suddhodana’s home. 
			<br>Seated there he said this to the Sakyans, 
			<br>“Where is the boy? I too wish to see him!” </p>
	</div>

<hr>

<p><span class="speaker">Narrator</span></p>

		<p>Then the Sakyans showed their son to the one named Asita</p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p><span class="parno">686</span>
			the boy shone like burning gold 
			<br>well-wrought in the forge; 
			<br>resplendent with glory, of peerless beauty. </p>

			<p id="p687"><span class="parno">687</span>
			The boy beamed like crested flame, 
			<br>pure as the moon, lord of stars traversing the sky, 
			<br>blazing like the sun free of clouds after the rains; 
			<br>seeing him, he was joyful, brimming with happiness. </p>
			
				<p id="p688"><span class="parno">688</span>
			The celestials held up a parasol in the sky, 
			<br>many-ribbed and thousand-circled; 
			<br>and golden-handled chowries waved—
			<br>but none could see who held the chowries or the parasols. </p>
				
			<p id="p689"><span class="parno">689</span>
			When the dreadlocked hermit they called “Dark Splendor” 
			<br>had seen the boy like a gold nugget on a cream rug 
			<br>with a white parasol held over his head, 
			<br>he received him, elated and happy. </p>
</div>

<hr>
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p690"><span class="parno">690</span>
			Having received the Sakyan bull, 
			<br>the seeker, master of marks and hymns, 
			<br>lifted up his voice with confident heart: 
			<br>“He is supreme, the best of men!” </p>
</div>

<hr>

<p><span class="speaker">Narrator</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p><span class="parno">691</span>
			But then, remembering he would depart this world, 
			<br>his spirits fell and his tears flowed. 
			<br>Seeing the weeping hermit, the Sakyans said, 
			<br>“Surely there will be no threat to the boy?” </p>
	</div>

<hr>

<p><span class="speaker">Narrator</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p><span class="parno">692</span>
			Seeing the crestfallen Sakyans, the hermit said, 
			<br>“I do not forsee harm befall the boy, 
			<br>and there will be no threat to him, 
			<br>not in the least; set your minds at ease. </p>
			
			<p id="p693"><span class="parno">693</span>
			This boy shall reach the highest awakening. 
			<br>As one of perfectly purified vision, compassionate for the welfare of the many, 
			<br>he shall roll forth the wheel of the teaching; 
			<br>his spiritual path will become widespread. </p>
			
			<p id="p694"><span class="parno">694</span>
			But I have not long left in this life, 
			<br>I shall die before then. 
			<br>I will never hear the teaching of the one who bore the unequaled burden. 
			<br>That’s why I’m so upset and distraught—it’s a disaster for me!” </p>
	</div>


<p><span class="speaker">Narrator</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p><span class="parno">695</span>
			Having brought abundant happiness to the Sakyans, 
			<br>the spiritual seeker left the royal compound. 
			<br>He had a nephew; and out of compassion 
			<br>he encouraged him in the teaching of the one who bore the unequaled burden. </p>
	</div>

<p><span class="speaker">Asita</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p><span class="parno">696</span>
			“When you hear the voice of another saying ‘Buddha’—
			<br>one who has attained awakening and who reveals the foremost teaching—
			<br>go there and ask about his breakthrough; 
			<br>lead the spiritual life under that Blessed One.” </p>
	</div>

<p><span class="speaker">Narrator</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p><span class="parno">697</span>
			Now, that Nālaka had a store of accumulated merit; 
			<br>so when instructed by one of such kindly intent, 
			<br>with perfectly purified vision of the future, 
			<br>he waited in hope for the Victor, guarding his senses. </p>
			
			<p id="p698"><span class="parno">698</span>
			When he heard of the Victor rolling forth the excellent wheel he went to him, 
			<br>and seeing the leading hermit, he became confident. 
			<br>The time of Asita’s instruction had arrived; 
			<br>so he asked the excellent sage about the highest sagacity. </p><p class="endsection">
			The introductory verses are finished. </p>
	</div>

<hr>

<p><span class="speaker">Nālaka</span></p>

<div class="verse">
		<p><span class="parno">699</span>
		“I now know that Asita’s words 
		<br>have turned out to be true. 
		<br>I ask you this, Gotama, 
		<br>who has gone beyond all things: </p>
		
		<p id="p700"><span class="parno">700</span>
		For one who has entered the homeless life, 
		<br>seeking food on alms round, 
		<br>when questioned, O sage, please tell me 
		<br>of sagacity, the ultimate state.” </p>
</div>

<hr>

<p><span class="speaker">Buddha</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p><span class="parno">701</span>
			“I shall school you in sagacity,” 
			<br>said the Buddha, 
			<br>“so difficult and challenging. 
			<br>Come, I shall tell you all about it. 
			<br>Brace yourself; stay strong! </p>
			
			<p id="p702"><span class="parno">702</span>
			In the village, keep the same attitude

	</div>

<hr>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p703"><span class="parno">703</span>
			Many different things come up, 
			<br>like tongues of fire in a forest. 
			<br>Women try to seduce a sage—
			<br>let them not seduce you! </p>
			
			<p id="p704"><span class="parno">704</span>
			Refraining from sex, 
			<br>having left behind sensual pleasures high and low, 
			<br>don’t be hostile or attached 
			<br>to living creatures firm or frail. </p>
			
			<p id="p705"><span class="parno">705</span>
			‘As am I, so are they;

			<p id="p706"><span class="parno">706</span>
			Leaving behind desire and greed 
			<br>for what ordinary people are attached to, 
			<br>a seer would set out to practice, 
			<br>they’d cross over this abyss. </p>
			
			<p id="p707"><span class="parno">707</span>
			With empty stomach, taking limited food, 
			<br>few in wishes, not greedy; 
			<br>truly hungerless regarding all desires, 
			<br>desireless, one is quenched. </p>
			
			<p id="p708"><span class="parno">708</span>
			Having wandered for alms, 
			<br>they’d take themselves into the forest; 
			<br>and nearing the foot of a tree, 
			<br>the sage would take their seat. </p>
			
			<p id="p709"><span class="parno">709</span>
			That wise one intent on absorption, 
			<br>would delight within the forest. 
			<br>They’d practice absorption at the foot of a tree, 
			<br>filling themselves with bliss. </p>
			
			<p id="p710"><span class="parno">710</span>
			Then, at the end of the night, 
			<br>they’d take themselves into a village. 
			<br>They’d not welcome being called, 
			<br>nor offerings brought from the village. </p>
			
			<p id="p711"><span class="parno">711</span>
			A sage who has come to a village 
			<br>would not walk hastily among the families. 
			<br>They’d not discuss their search for food, 
			<br>nor would they speak suggestively. </p>
			
			<p id="p712"><span class="parno">712</span>
			‘I got something, that’s good. 
			<br>I got nothing, that’s fine.’ 
			<br>Impartial in both cases, 
			<br>they return right to the tree. </p>
	</div>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p713"><span class="parno">713</span>
			Wandering with bowl in hand, 
			<br>not dumb, but thought to be dumb, 
			<br>they wouldn’t scorn a tiny gift, 
			<br>nor look down upon the giver. </p>
			
			<p id="p714"><span class="parno">714</span>
			For the practice has many aspects, 
			<br>as explained by the Ascetic. 
			<br>They do not go to the far shore twice, 
			<br>nor having gone once do they fall away. </p>
			
			<p id="p715"><span class="parno">715</span>
			When a mendicant has no creeping, 
			<br>and has cut the stream of craving, 
			<br>and given up all the various duties, 
			<br>no fever is found in them. </p>
			
			<p id="p716"><span class="parno">716</span>
			I shall school you in sagacity. 
			<br>Practice as if you were licking a razor’s edge. 
			<br>With tongue pressed to the roof of your mouth, 
			<br>be restrained regarding your stomach. </p>
			
			<p id="p717"><span class="parno">717</span>
			Don’t be sluggish in mind, 
			<br>nor think overly much. 
			<br>Be free of putrefaction and unattached, 
			<br>committed to the spiritual life. </p>
			
			<p id="p718"><span class="parno">718</span>
			Train in a lonely seat, 
			<br>attending closely to ascetics; 
			<br>solitude is sagacity, they say. 
			<br>If you welcome solitude, 
			<br>you’ll light up the ten directions. </p>
			
			<p id="p719"><span class="parno">719</span>
			Having heard the words of the wise, 
			<br>the meditators who’ve given up sensual desires, 
			<br>a follower of mine would develop 
			<br>conscience and faith all the more. </p>
			
						<p id="720"><span class="parno">720</span>
			Understand this by the way streams move 
			<br>in clefts and crevices: 
			<br>the little creeks flow on babbling, 
			<br>while silent flow the great rivers. </p>
			
			<p id="p721"><span class="parno">721</span>
			What is lacking, babbles; 
			<br>what is full is at peace. 
			<br>The fool is like a half-full pot; 
			<br>the wise like a brimfull lake. </p>
			
			<p id="p722"><span class="parno">722</span>
			When the Ascetic speaks much 
			<br>it is relevant and meaningful: 
			<br>knowing, he teaches the Dhamma; 
			<br>knowing, he speaks much. </p>
			
			<p id="p723"><span class="parno">723</span>
			But one who, knowing, is restrained, 
			<br>knowing, does not speak much; 
			<br>that sage is worthy of sagacity, 
			<br>that sage has achieved sagacity.” </p>
