<h2>3:12 Contemplation of Dyads</h2>

<p>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling in Sāvatthī in the Eastern Park in Migāramātā’s mansion. Now on that occasion &mdash; the uposatha day of the fifteenth, the full-moon night &mdash; the Blessed One was seated in the open surrounded by the Sangha of bhikkhus. [140] Then, having surveyed the completely silent Sangha of bhikkhus, he addressed them thus:</p>

<p>“Bhikkhus, if others ask you, ‘What is your aim in listening to those teachings that are wholesome, noble, emancipating, leading to enlightenment?’ you should answer them thus: ‘For the accurate knowledge of things arranged in dyads.’ And what would one call a dyad?</p>

<p><i>[1. The four noble truths]</i></p>

<p>“’This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering’ &mdash; this is one contemplation. ‘This is the cessation of suffering, this is the way leading to the cessation of suffering’ &mdash; this is a second contemplation. When a bhikkhu dwells thus correctly contemplating a dyad &mdash; heedful, ardent, and resolute &mdash; one of two fruits is to be expected of him: either final knowledge in this very life or, if there is a residue remaining, the state of non-returning.”</p>

<hr>

<p>This is what the Blessed One said. Having said this, the Fortunate One, the Teacher, further said this:</p>

<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Here and below I have added the subheadings to make explicit the topic of the section.</span></span></span>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">724</span>“Those who do not understand suffering,<br>
or the origin of suffering;<br>
who do not know where suffering<br>
completely ceases without remainder;<br>
and who do not know the path<br>
that leads to the allaying of suffering: (1)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">725</span>“they are destitute of liberation of mind<br>
and also of liberation by wisdom.<br>
Incapable of making an end,<br>
they fare on to birth and old age. (2)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">726</span>“But those who understand suffering,<br>
and the origin of suffering;<br>
[who know as well] where suffering<br>
completely ceases without remainder; [141]<br>
and who understand the path<br>
that leads to the allaying of suffering: (3)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">727</span>“they are possessed of mind’s liberation<br>
and also liberation by wisdom.<br>
Capable of making an end,<br>
they fare no more to birth and old age. (4)</p>

<p><i>[2. Acquisition]</i></p>
<p>“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’ you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’ And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by acquisition’ &mdash; this is one contemplation. ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of acquisitions, there is no origination of suffering’ &mdash; this is a second contemplation. </p>

<p>When a bhikkhu dwells thus . . .” the Teacher further said this:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">728</span>“Sufferings in their many forms in the world<br>
originate based on acquisition.<br>
The ignorant dullard who creates acquisition<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The text uses the plural <i>upadh</i><i>ī</i><i>naṃ</i> in the prose portion but the singular accusative <i>upadhiṃ</i> in the verse.</span></span></span><br>
encounters suffering again and again.<br>
Therefore, understanding, one should not create acquisition,<br>
contemplating it as the genesis and origin of suffering. (5)</p>

<p><i>[3. Ignorance]</i></p>

<hr>

<p>“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’ you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’ And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by ignorance’ &mdash; this is one contemplation. ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance, there is no origination of suffering’ &mdash; this is a second contemplation. </p>

<p>When a bhikkhu dwells thus . . .” the Teacher further said this: [142]</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">729</span>“Those who travel again and again<br>
in the saṃsāra of birth and death,<br>
with its becoming thus, becoming otherwise:<br>
that journey is due to ignorance. (6)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">730</span>“It is because of ignorance, this great delusion,<br>
that one has wandered on for so long.<br>
But those beings who have gained clear knowledge<br>
do not come back to renewed existence.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">I read with <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span> and <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> <i>n</i><i>ā</i><i>gacchanti</i>, as against <span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> <i>na te gacchanti</i>.</span></span></span> (7)</p>

<p><i>[4. Volitional activities]</i></p>

<p>“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’ you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’ And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by volitional activities’ &mdash; this is one contemplation. ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of volitional activities, there is no origination of suffering’ &mdash; this is a second contemplation. </p>

<p>When a bhikkhu dwells thus . . .” the Teacher further said this:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">731</span>“Whatever suffering originates<br>
is all conditioned by volitional activities.<br>
With the cessation of volitional activities,<br>
there is no origination of suffering. (8)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">732</span>“When one has known this danger,<br>
‘Suffering is conditioned by volitional activities,’<br>
by the stilling of all volitional activities,<br>
by the stopping of perceptions,<br>
the destruction of suffering occurs<br>
when one has known this as it really is. (9)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">733</span>“Seeing rightly, the masters of knowledge,<br>
the wise ones, having correctly known this,<br>
overcome the yoke of Māra<br>
and do not come back to renewed existence. (10) [143]</p>

<p><i>[5. Consciousness]</i></p>

<p>“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’ you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’ And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by consciousness’ &mdash; this is one contemplation. ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of consciousness, there is no origination of suffering’ &mdash; this is a second contemplation. </p>

<p>When a bhikkhu dwells thus . . .” the Teacher further said this:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">734</span>“Whatever suffering originates<br>
is all conditioned by consciousness.<br>
With the cessation of consciousness,<br>
there is no origination of suffering. (11)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">735</span>“Having understood this danger,<br>
‘Suffering is conditioned by consciousness,’<br>
by the stilling of consciousness, a bhikkhu,<br>
hungerless, has attained nibbāna. (12)</p>

<p><i>[6. Contact]</i></p>

<p>“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’ you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’ And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by contact’ &mdash; this is one contemplation. ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of contact, there is no origination of suffering’ &mdash; this is a second contemplation. </p>

<p>When a bhikkhu dwells thus . . .” the Teacher further said this:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">736</span>“Those afflicted by contact,<br>
flowing along with the stream of existence,<br>
have entered upon a deviant path:<br>
the destruction of the fetters is far from them. (13)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">737</span>“But those who have fully understood contact,<br>
who, having known it, delight in peace,<br>
by breaking through contact,<br>
hungerless, are fully quenched. (14)</p>

<p><i>[7. Feeling]</i></p>

<p>“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’ you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’ And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by feeling’ &mdash; this is one contemplation. ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of feeling, there is no origination of suffering’ &mdash; this is a second contemplation. </p>

<p>When a bhikkhu dwells thus . . .” the Teacher further said this: [144]</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">738</span>“Whether it is pleasant or painful<br>
or neither-painful-nor-pleasant,<br>
whatever there is that is felt<br>
internally and externally, (15)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">739</span>“having known, ‘This is suffering,<br>
of a false nature, disintegrating,’<br>
having touched and touched them,<br>
seeing their vanishing, one understands them thus.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">I read here with <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span> and <span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> <i>evaṃ tattha vijānāti</i> as against <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> <i>evaṃ tattha virajjati</i>.</span></span></span><br>
Through the destruction of feelings, a bhikkhu,<br>
hungerless, is fully quenched. (16)</p>


<p><i>[8. Craving]</i></p>

<p>“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’ you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’ And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by craving’ &mdash; this is one contemplation. ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of craving, there is no origination of suffering’ &mdash; this is a second contemplation. </p>

<p>When a bhikkhu dwells thus . . .” the Teacher further said this:</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">740</span>“With craving as partner, a person,<br>
wandering on this long journey,<br>
does not transcend saṃsāra,<br>
with its becoming thus, becoming otherwise. (17)</p>


<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">741</span>“Having known this danger,<br>
‘Craving is the origin of suffering,’<br>
a bhikkhu should wander mindfully,<br>
free of craving, without grasping. (18)</p>

<p><i>[9. Clinging]</i></p>

<p>“If, bhikkhus, there are those who ask, ‘Could there be correct contemplation of dyads in some other way?’ you should answer them thus: ‘There could be.’ And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘Whatever suffering originates is all conditioned by clinging’ &mdash; this is one contemplation. ‘With the remainderless fading away and cessation of clinging, there is no origination of suffering’ &mdash; this is a second contemplation. </p>

<p>When a bhikkhu dwells thus . . .” the Teacher further said this:</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">742</span>“Existence is conditioned by clinging;<br>
an existent being undergoes suffering.<br>
For one who is born there is death;<br>
this is the origin of suffering. (19)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">743</span>“Therefore, having correctly understood,<br>
having directly known the destruction of birth,<br>
through the destruction of clinging the wise<br>

‘Suffering is conditioned by instigation,’<br>
having relinquished all instigation,<br>
one is liberated in non-instigation. (22)</p>

<p><i>[11. Nutriment]</i></p>
