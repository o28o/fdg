<h2>3:12 Contemplating Pairs</h2>

<p>So I have heard:</p>

<p>At one time the Buddha was staying near Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery, the stilt longhouse of Migāra’s mother. Now, at that time it was the sabbath—the full moon on the fifteenth day—and the Buddha was sitting in the open surrounded by the Saṅgha of monks. Then the Buddha looked around the Saṅgha of monks, who were so very silent. He addressed them:</p>

<p>“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘There are skillful teachings that are noble, emancipating, and lead to awakening. What is the real reason for listening to such teachings?’ You should answer: ‘Only so as to truly know the pairs of teachings.’ </p>

<hr>

<p>And what pairs do they speak of? </p>

<p>‘This is suffering; this is the origin of suffering’: this is the first contemplation. ‘This is the cessation of suffering; this is the practice that leads to the cessation of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates rightly contemplating a pair of teachings in this way—diligent, keen, and resolute—they can expect one of two results: enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return.” </p>

<p>That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>

<hr>
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p730"><span class="parno">730</span>
			“There are those who don’t understand suffering 
			<br>and suffering’s cause, 
			<br>and where all suffering 
			<br>ceases with nothing left over. 
			<br>And they don’t know the path 
			<br>that leads to the stilling of suffering. </p>
			
			<p id="p731"><span class="parno">731</span>
			They lack the heart’s release, 
			<br>as well as the release by wisdom. 
			<br>Unable to make an end, 
			<br>they continue to be reborn and grow old. </p>
			
			<p id="p732"><span class="parno">732</span>
			But there are those who understand suffering 
			<br>and suffering’s cause, 
			<br>and where all suffering 
			<br>ceases with nothing left over. 
			<br>And they understand the path 
			<br>that leads to the stilling of suffering. </p>
			
			<p id="p733"><span class="parno">733</span>
			They’re endowed with the heart’s release, 
			<br>as well as the release by wisdom. 
			<br>Able to make an end, 
			<br>they don’t continue to be reborn and grow old.” </p>
	</div>

<hr>
<p>“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘Could there be another way to contemplate the pairs?’ You should say, ‘There could.’ 
And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘All the suffering that originates is caused by attachment’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of attachment there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.” Then the Teacher went on to say: </p>

<p>“‘Whatever suffering arises, all is caused by attachments’, this is one observation. ‘With the complete ending of all attachments there is no arising of suffering’, this is a second observation. Rightly observing this duality, a monk who meditates diligent, ardent, and resolute may expect one of two results: final knowledge in this very life, or is there is anything left over, non-return."</p>

<p>This is what the Buddha said. Having said this, the Teacher, the Sublime One, said further:</p>

<hr>
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p734"><span class="parno">734</span>
			“Attachment is the source of suffering 
			<br>in all its countless forms in the world. 
			<br>When an ignorant person builds up attachments, 
			<br>that idiot returns to suffering again and again. 
			<br>So let one who understands not build up attachments, 
			<br>contemplating the origin of suffering and rebirth.” </p>
	</div>

<hr>
<p>“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘Could there be another way to contemplate the pairs?’ You should say, ‘There could.’ And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘All the suffering that originates is caused by ignorance’: this is one contemplation. 
‘With the utter cessation of ignorance there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. 
When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.” </p>

<p>Then the Teacher went on to say: </p>

<hr>
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p735"><span class="parno">735</span>
			“Those who journey again and again, 
			<br>transmigrating through birth and death; 
			<br>they go from this state to another, 
			<br>destined only for ignorance. </p>
			
			<p id="p736"><span class="parno">736</span>
			For ignorance is the great delusion 
			<br>because of which we have long transmigrated. 
			<br>Those beings who have arrived at knowledge 
			<br>do not proceed to a future life.” </p>
	</div>

<hr>
<p>“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be? </p>

<p>
‘All the suffering that originates is caused by choices’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of choices there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.” </p>

<p>Then the Teacher went on to say: </p>

<hr>
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p737"><span class="parno">737</span>

			Knowing this danger, 
			<br>that suffering is caused by choices; 
			<br>through the stilling of all choices, 
			<br>and the stopping of perceptions, 
			<br>this is the way suffering ends. 
			<br>For those who truly know this, </p>
			
			<p id="p739"><span class="parno">739</span>

			<br>the astute, understanding rightly,

<p>
“‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘All the suffering that originates is caused by consciousness’: this is one contemplation. ‘With the utter cessation of consciousness there is no origination of suffering’: this is the second contemplation.

When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.”</p>

<p>‘Formless states are more peaceful than states of form’: this is the first contemplation. ‘Cessation is more peaceful than formless states’: this is the second contemplation. When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.” </p>

<p>Then the Teacher went on to say: </p>

<hr>
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p760"><span class="parno">760</span>
			“There are beings in the realm of luminous form,

			<p id="p761"><span class="parno">761</span>
			But the people who completely understand form, 
			<br>not stuck in the formless, 
			<br>released in cessation—
			<br>they are conquerors of death.” </p>
	</div>

<hr>
<p> “‘Could there be another way?’ … And how could there be?</p>

<p>‘What this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—focuses on as true, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually false’: this is the first contemplation. 
‘What this world focuses on as false, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually true’: this is the second contemplation. 
When a mendicant meditates in this way they can expect enlightenment or non-return.” </p>

<p>Then the Teacher went on to say:</p>

<hr>
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p762"><span class="parno">762</span>
			“See how the world with its gods 
			<br>imagines not-self to be self; 
			<br>habituated to name and form, 
			<br>imagining this is truth. </p>
			
			<p id="p763"><span class="parno">763</span>
			For whatever you imagine it is, 
			<br>it turns out to be something else. 
			<br>And that is what is false in it, 
			<br>for the ephemeral is deceptive by nature. </p>
			
			<p id="p764"><span class="parno">764</span>
			Extinguishment has an undeceptive nature, 
			<br>the noble ones know it as truth. 
			<br>Having comprehended the truth,
			<br>they are hungerless, extinguished.” </p>
	</div>

<hr>

<p>“Suppose, mendicants, they questioned you thus: ‘Could there be another way to contemplate the pairs?’ You should say, ‘There could.’ And how could there be? </p>

<p>‘What this world—with its gods, Māras, and Brahmās, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its gods and humans—focuses on as happiness, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually suffering’: this is the first contemplation. 
‘What this world focuses on as suffering, the noble ones have clearly seen with right wisdom to be actually happiness’: this is the second contemplation. 
When a mendicant meditates rightly contemplating a pair of teachings in this way—diligent, keen, and resolute—they can expect one of two results: 
enlightenment in the present life, or if there’s something left over, non-return. </p>

<p>That is what the Buddha said. Then the Holy One, the Teacher, went on to say: </p>

<hr>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p765"><span class="parno">765</span>
			“Sights, sounds, tastes, smells, 
			<br>touches, and thoughts, the lot of them—
			<br>they’re likable, desirable, and pleasurable 
			<br>as long as you can say that they exist. </p>
			
			<p id="p766"><span class="parno">766</span>
			For all the world with its gods, 
			<br>this is what they agree is happiness. 
			<br>And where they cease 
			<br>is agreed on as suffering for them. </p>
			
			<p id="p767"><span class="parno">767</span>
			The noble ones have seen as happiness 
			<br>the ceasing of identity. 
			<br>This insight by those who see 
			<br>contradicts the whole world. </p>
			
			<p id="p768"><span class="parno">768</span>
			What others say is happiness 
			<br>the noble ones say is suffering. 
			<br>What others say is suffering 
			<br>the noble ones know as happiness. </p>
			
			<p id="p769"><span class="parno">769</span>
			See, this teaching is hard to understand, 
			<br>it confuses the ignorant. 
			<br>There is darkness for the shrouded; 
			<br>blackness for those who don’t see. </p>
			
			
			<p id="p770"><span class="parno">770</span>
			But the good are open; 
			<br>like light for those who see. 
			<br>Though close, they do not understand, 
			<br>those fools inexpert in the teaching. </p>
			
			<p id="p771"><span class="parno">771</span>
			They’re mired in desire to be reborn, 
			<br>flowing along the stream of lives, 
			<br>mired in Māra’s sway: 
			<br>this teaching isn’t easy for them to understand. </p>
			
			<p id="p772"><span class="parno">772</span>
			Who, apart from the noble ones, 
			<br>is qualified to understand this state? 
			<br>Having rightly understood this state, 
			<br>the undefiled become fully extinguished.” </p>
	</div>

<hr>
<p>That is what the Buddha said. Satisfied, the mendicants were happy with what the Buddha said. And while this discourse was being spoken, the minds of sixty mendicants were freed from defilements by not grasping. </p>
