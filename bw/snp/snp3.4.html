<h2>3:4 With Bhāradvāja of Sundarikā on the Sacrificial Cake</h2>

<p><span class="evam">So I have heard</span>:</p>

<p>At one time the Buddha was staying in the Kosalan lands on the bank of the Sundarikā river. Now at that time the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja was serving the sacred flame and performing the fire sacrifice on the bank of the Sundarikā. Then he looked all around the four quarters, wondering: “Now who might eat the leftovers of this offering?” He saw the Buddha meditating at the root of a certain tree with his robe pulled over his head. Taking the leftovers of the offering in his left hand and a pitcher in the right he approached the Buddha. </p>

<p>When he heard Sundarikabhāradvāja’s footsteps the Buddha uncovered his head. Sundarikabhāradvāja thought: “This man is shaven, he is shaven!” And he wanted to turn back. </p>

<p>But he thought: “Even some brahmins are shaven. Why don’t I go to him and ask about his birth?” Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja went up to the Buddha, and said to him: “Sir, in what caste were you born?” </p>

<p>Then the Buddha addressed Sundarikabhāradvāja in verse: </p>

<hr>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p455"><span class="parno">455</span>
“I am no brahmin, nor am I a prince, 
<br>nor merchant nor anything else. 
<br>Fully understanding the clan of ordinary people, 
<br>I wander in the world owning nothing, reflective. </p>

<p id="p456"><span class="parno">456</span>
Clad in my cloak, I wander without home, 
<br>my hair shorn, quenched. 
<br>Since I’m unburdened by youngsters, 
<br>it’s inappropriate to ask me about clan.” </p>
</div>

<p><span class="speaker">Sundarika</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
		<p><span class="parno">457</span>
		“Actually sir, when brahmins meet they politely 
		<br>ask each other whether they are brahmins.” </p>

			<p>“Well, if you say that you’re a brahmin, 
			<br>and that I am not, 
			<br>I shall question you on the Gāyatrī Mantra, 
			<br>with its three lines and twenty-four syllables.” </p>
	</div>

<p><span class="speaker">Buddha</span></p>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="parno">458</span>
“On what grounds have hermits and men, 
<br>aristocrats and brahmins here in the world 
<br>performed so many different sacrifices to the gods?”</p>

<p>“During a sacrifice, should a past-master, a knowledge master, 
<br>receive an oblation, it profits the donor, I say.” </p>
</div>

<hr>

<p><span class="speaker">Sundarika</span></p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p>“Then clearly my oblation will be profitable,” 
			<br>said the brahmin, 
			<br>“since I have met such a knowledge master. 
			<br>It’s because I’d never met anyone like you 
			<br>that others ate the sacrificial cake.” </p>
	</div>

<p><span class="speaker">Buddha</span><p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p><span class="parno">460</span>
			“So then, brahmin, since you have approached me

<p>Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja said to the Buddha: “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent! As if he were righting the overturned, or revealing the hidden, or pointing out the path to the lost, or lighting a lamp in the dark so people with good eyes can see what’s there, Master Gotama has made the teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the teaching, and to the mendicant Saṅgha. Sir, may I receive the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence?” And the brahmin Sundarika Bhāradvāja received the going forth, the ordination in the Buddha’s presence. And soon after, he became one of the perfected. </p>
