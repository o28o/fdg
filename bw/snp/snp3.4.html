<h2>3:4 Sundarikabhāradvāj</h2>

<p>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling among the Kosalans on the bank of the river Sundarikā. Now on that occasion the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja was offering a fire sacrifice and performing the fire oblation on the bank of the river Sundarikā. Then, after he had offered the fire sacrifice and performed the fire oblation, the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja rose from his seat and surveyed the four directions all around, wondering: “Who might eat the remains of the offering?”</p>

<p>The brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja then saw [80] the Blessed One sitting nearby at the foot of a certain tree with his head covered. Having seen him, he took the remains of the offering in his left hand and the waterpot in his right hand and approached the Blessed One. </p>

<p>With the sound of his footsteps, the Blessed One uncovered his head. </p>

<p>Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja, thinking, “This worthy one is shaven-headed, this worthy one is a shaveling,” wanted to turn back. </p>

<p>But it occurred to him: “Some brahmins here are also shaven-headed. Let me approach him and inquire about his social class.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja approached the Blessed One and said to him: “What is the worthy one’s social class?” </p>

<p>The Blessed One then addressed the brahmin in verses:</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">455</span>“I am not a brahmin nor am I a prince;<br>
I am not a vessa or anything else.<br>
Having fully understood the clan of worldlings,<br>
owning nothing, with reflection I live in the world. (1)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">456</span>“Clad in my cloak, homeless I wander,<br>
with my head shaved, fully quenched within.<br>
Since I am unattached to people here,<br>
it is unfitting, brahmin, to ask me about my clan.” (2) [81]</p>

<p><span class ="parno">457</span>[The brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja said:] “Brahmins, sir, ask other brahmins: ‘Is the worthy one a brahmin?’”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> prints this sentence as prose but includes it under verse 457 (in its numbering scheme). <span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> numbers it as if it were a distinct two-line verse and <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span> incorporates it as part of the verse that includes the following lines. In several of the following stanzas, too, it is uncertain whether the lines are to be taken as prose or verse. For details, see Norman’s comments on each verse in <span class="var" title="The Group of Discourses (see Norman 2006b)">GD</span>.</span></span></span></p>


<p><strong>[The Blessed One:]</strong></p>

<hr id="savittī">

<p class="verse">“But if you say you are a brahmin,<br>
and say I am not a brahmin,<br>
let me ask you about the Sāvittī,<br>
with its three phrases and twenty-four syllables.”<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Sāvittī (Skt Sāvitrī) is a verse or prayer addressed to the sun, especially the celebrated verse of the Ṛgveda, III,62,10, also called Gāyatrī.</span></span></span> (3)</p>

<p><strong>[The brahmin:]</strong></p>
<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">458</span>“On what ground have many rishis, men, khattiyas, and brahmins<br>
here in the world performed sacrifices to the deities?”</p>

<p><strong>[The Blessed One:]</strong></p>

<p class="verse">“If an accomplished one, a Veda-master, at the time of sacrifice,<br>
gains an offering from anyone, it succeeds for the donor, I say.” (4)</p>

<p><strong>[The brahmin:]</strong></p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">459</span>“Surely, this offering of his must succeed,”<br>
“since we have seen such a Veda-master.<br>
It is because we have not seen those like you<br>
that other people eat the sacrificial cake.” (5)</p>

<p><strong>[The Blessed One:]</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">460</span>“Therefore, brahmin, as you seek the good,<br>
approach me here and ask your question.<br>
Perhaps you may find here one at peace,<br>
smokeless, untroubled, desireless, and very wise.” (6)</p>

<p><strong>[The brahmin:]</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">461</span>“Master Gotama, since I delight in sacrifice<br>
I wish to hold a sacrifice but do not understand.<br>
Let the worthy one instruct me: [82]<br>
please tell me where an offering succeeds.” (7)</p>

<p><strong>[The Blessed One:]</strong></p>
<p>“In that case, brahmin, lend an ear. I will teach you the Dhamma.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Norman treats this sentence as part of the verse, but with <span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> and <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> I take it to be a prose interjection. <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span> counts this sentence as a separate verse.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">462</span>“Ask not of social class but ask of conduct:<br>

who has reached the end of the Vedas,<br>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">464</span>“Those homeless ones who have abandoned sensual pleasures,<br>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">465</span>“Those devoid of lust, with well-concentrated faculties,<br>
freed like the moon from the grip of Rāhu:<br>
a brahmin who would sacrifice intent on merit<br>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">466</span>“Those who wander in the world without attachments,<br>
always mindful, having abandoned things taken as ‘mine’:<br>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">467</span>“Having renounced sensual pleasures, faring triumphant,<br>

Following the commentarial interpretation, the line <i>samo samehi visamehi dūre</i> would be translated: “Equal to equals, far from unequals.” I render the lemma here to accord with the commentarial interpretation, but I translate the text according to my understanding of the intended meaning. The line, as I see it, involves a word play. <i>Sama</i> means both “equal” and “righteous, virtuous,” while <i>visama</i> means both “different, unequal” and “unrighteous, unvirtuous.” The verse can thus be read as asserting that the Buddha is an equal of the righteous but far from the unrighteous. See <a href="../sn/sn1.7.html#p3">SNI.7</a> <i>caranti visame samaṃ</i>; <a href="../sn/sn2.8.html#p6">SN2.8</a><i> ariyānaṃ samo maggo, ariyā hi visame samā</i>; and <a href="../an/an11.11.html#p4">AN11.11 verse 4</a>, <i>ariyasāvako visamagatāya pajāya samappatto viharati</i>.</span></span></span><br>

<p>Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja said this to the Blessed One: “Excellent, Master Gotama! Excellent, Master Gotama! Master Gotama has made the Dhamma clear in many ways, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown, revealing what was hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, or holding up a lamp in the darkness so those with good eyesight can see forms. I go for refuge to Master Gotama, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. May I receive the going forth under Master Gotama, may I receive the full ordination.”</p>

<p>Then the brahmin Sundarikabhāradvāja received the going forth under the Blessed One . . . [as at I,4] . . . became one of the arahants.</p>
