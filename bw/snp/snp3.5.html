<h2>3:5 Māgha</h2>

<p>Thus have a heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha on Mount Vulture Peak. Then the brahmin student Māgha approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side [87] and said to the Blessed One:</p>

<p>“Master Gotama, I am a donor, a lord of giving, bountiful, devoted to charity. I seek wealth righteously, and having done so, from my wealth righteously gained, righteously acquired, <a id="calibre_link-5671" class="calibre1"></a>I give to one person, I give to two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten people; I give to twenty, thirty, forty, fifty people; I give to a hundred people and even more. When I give thus, Master Gotama, when I sacrifice thus, do I generate much merit?”</p>
<p>“Surely, student, when you give thus, when you sacrifice thus, you generate much merit. Student, one who is a donor, a lord of giving, bountiful, devoted to charity, who seeks wealth righteously, and having done so, from his wealth righteously gained, righteously acquired, gives to one person . . . gives to a hundred people and even more, generates much merit.”</p>

<p>Then the brahmin student Māgha addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>

<p><strong>[Māgha:]</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">508</span>“Who is purified, freed, and bound?<br>
By what means does one go to the brahma world?<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><i>Ken’attanā gacchati brahmalokaṃ</i>. I render this line in accordance with the gloss of <span class="var" title="Paramatthajotikā II (Suttanipāta-aṭṭhakathā)">Pj II</span>: <i>ken’attanā ti kena kāraṇena</i>. Text has <i>ken’attanā gacchati brahmalokaṃ</i>, which Pj II glosses <i>ken’attanā ti kena kāraṇena</i>. The reflexive use of instrumental <i>attanā</i> is common in Pāli, but apart from verses 477, 756, and 1119 there is almost no explicit discussion in Sn of the opposition between views of <i>attā</i> and the Buddha’s teaching of <i>anattā</i>. I therefore think it unlikely that the brahmin asked his question with the view of an <i>att</i><i>ā</i><span>, a substantial self, as the underlying premise. The Buddha’s reply does not challenge such an assumption, and <span class="var" title="Paramatthajotikā II (Suttanipāta-aṭṭhakathā)">Pj II</span> evidently takes</span> <i>attanā</i> in a simple reflexive sense. I have translated the line in compliance with the comment that takes <i>attan</i><i>ā</i> <span>as equivalent to</span> <i>k</i><i>ā</i><i>raṇena</i>, “cause, means.” Jayawickrama treats <i>attanā</i> as the reflexive pronoun in his rendering of the line: “With (the aid of what) does one go to the world of Brahma oneself?” Norman, however, translates it as if the speaker had assumed a metaphysical entity: “With what self does one go to the Brahma-world?”</span></span></span><br>
Since I do not know, O muni, please tell me when asked.<br>
The Blessed One is Brahmā made manifest, seen by me today, [91]<br>
for in truth you are like Brahmā to us.<br>
How is one reborn in the brahma world, O luminous one?” (22)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>[The Blessed One:]</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">509</span>“One who performs a sacrifice with the threefold excellence,
“such a one should accomplish it with those worthy of offerings.<br>
Having sacrificed thus, one rightly devoted to charity<br>
is reborn in the brahma world, I say.” (23)</p>

<p>When this was said, the brahmin student Māgha said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, Master Gotama! . . . [as at I,7] . . . Let Master Gotama consider me a lay follower who from today has gone for refuge for life.”</p>
