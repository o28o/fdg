<h2>3:6 Sabhiya</h2>

<p>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground. Now on that occasion a deity who had formerly been a blood relation of the wanderer Sabhiya had briefly recited a number of questions to him, saying: “You should lead the spiritual life, Sabhiya, under the ascetic or brahmin who answers these questions for you.” </p>

<p>Then, having learned those questions from the deity, the wanderer Sabhiya approached those ascetics and brahmins who were leaders of sanghas, leaders of groups, teachers of groups, well known and famous, ford-makers, [92] considered holy by many people; that is, Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belaṭṭhiputta, and the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta. He asked them those questions, but they did not reply. Not only did they fail to reply, but they displayed irritation, hatred, and displeasure, and they even questioned the wanderer Sabhiya himself.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to the wanderer Sabhiya: “Now these worthy ascetics and brahmins are leaders of sanghas, leaders of groups, teachers of groups, well known and famous, ford-makers, considered holy by many people; that is, Pūraṇa Kassapa . . . the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta. When I asked them those questions, they did not reply. Not only did they fail to reply, but they displayed irritation, hatred, and displeasure, and even questioned me about them. Let me now revert to the lower life and enjoy sensual pleasures.”</p>

<p>Then it occurred to the wanderer Sabhiya: “Now this ascetic Gotama, too, is the leader of a saṅgha, the leader of a group, the teacher of a group, well known and famous, a ford-maker, considered holy by many people. Let me approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him these questions.” </p>

<p>But it then occurred to him: “Those worthy ascetics and brahmins who are leaders of sanghas, leaders of groups, teachers of groups, well known and famous, ford-makers, considered holy by many people, are old, aged, mature, advanced in life, come to the last stage; they are elders, of long-standing, who have long gone forth; that is, Pūraṇa Kassapa . . . [93] . . . the Nigaṇṭha Nātaputta. Yet when I asked them those questions, they did not reply. Not only did they fail to reply, but they displayed irritation, hatred, and displeasure, and even questioned me about them. How then could the ascetic Gotama reply to those questions, when he is young in years and just newly gone forth?”</p>

<p>But it then occurred to him: “An ascetic should not be belittled or disparaged just because he is young. For even if an ascetic is young, he might be powerful and mighty. Let me then approach the ascetic Gotama and ask him these questions.”</p>

<p>Then the wanderer Sabhiya set out on tour in the direction of Rājagaha. Wandering on tour, in stages he arrived at Rājagaha, at the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels’ feeding ground, and approached the Blessed One. He exchanged greetings with the Blessed One, and when they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down at one side and addressed the Blessed One in verse:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(Said Sabhiya)</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">510</span>“Perplexed and full of doubt,”<br>
“I’ve come desiring to ask questions.<br>
Please put an end to them for me.<br>
Being asked questions by me in sequence,<br>
answer me in accordance with the Dhamma.” <span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p"><span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> prints these lines (and the parallel lines in the next verse) as prose, but Norman proposes that they “can be taken as Śloka meter, with resolution of the sixth syllable in pāda d and of the first syllable in pāda e” (<span class="var" title="The Group of Discourses (see Norman 2006b)">GD</span> 255&ndash;56). Hence I include them in the verses.</span></span></span> (1) [94]</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(Sabhiya,” said the Blessed One)</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">511</span>“You have come from afar,<br>
“desiring to ask questions.<br>
I will put an end to them for you.<br>
Being asked questions by you in sequence,<br>
I’ll answer you in accordance with the Dhamma. (2)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">512</span>“Ask me, Sabhiya, your questions,<br>
whatever you wish in your mind.<br>
For you I will put an end<br>
to each of those questions.” (3)<br>
<p>Then it occurred to the wanderer Sabhiya: “It is indeed wonderful! It is astounding! The other ascetics and brahmins did not even give me permission, but I have been given permission by the ascetic Gotama.” Then pleased, jubilant, elated, full of rapture and joy, he asked the Blessed One a question:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(Said Sabhiya)</strong></p>

<p class="verse" id="p513"><span class ="parno">513</span>“What has he attained, the one they call a bhikkhu?”<br>
“In what way is one gentle, and how do they call one tamed?<br>
How is one said to be enlightened?<br>
When asked by me, Blessed One, please answer.” (4) [95]</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(Sabhiya,” said the Blessed One)</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">514</span>“When by the path practiced by oneself,<br>
“one has attained nibbāna, crossed over doubt,<br>
abandoned nonexistence and existence,<br>
lived [the spiritual life],<br>
finished with renewed existence: he is a bhikkhu. (5)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">515</span>“Equanimous toward everything, mindful,<br>
one who does not injure anyone in all the world,<br>
an ascetic who has crossed over, unsullied,<br>
for whom there are no swellings: he is gentle. (6)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">516</span>“One whose faculties have been developed,<br>
internally and externally, in all the world,<br>
having pierced through this world and the next,<br>
one developed who awaits the time: he is tamed. (7)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">517</span>“Having examined all mental constructs,<br>
[and] saṃsāra, both passing away and rebirth,<br>
rid of dust, unblemished, purified,<br>
one who has attained the destruction of birth:<br>
they call him enlightened.” (8)<br>
<p>Then, having delighted and rejoiced in the Blessed One’s statement, being pleased, jubilant, elated, full of rapture and joy, the wanderer Sabhiya asked the Blessed One a further question:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(Said Sabhiya)</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">518</span>“What has he attained, the one they call a brahmin?”<br>
“In what way is one an ascetic, and how is one bathed? [96]<br>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">520</span>“One who is peaceful, having abandoned merit and evil,<br>
dustless, having understood this world and the next;<br>

<p>Then . . . the wanderer Sabhiya asked the Blessed One a further question:</p>

<p>Then the wanderer Sabhiya, having prostrated himself with his head at the Blessed One’s feet, said to the Blessed One: “Excellent, Bhante! . . . I go for refuge to the Blessed One, to <a id="calibre_link-1029" class="calibre1"></a>the Dhamma, and to the Sangha of bhikkhus. May I, Bhante, receive the going forth under the Blessed One, may I receive [102] full ordination.”</p>

<p>“Sabhiya, one formerly belonging to another sect who desires the going forth and full ordination in this Dhamma and discipline lives on probation for four months. At the end of the four months, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with him, they give him the going forth and full ordination as a bhikkhu. But individual differences are recognized by me.”</p>

<p>“If, Bhante, one formerly belonging to another sect who desires the going forth and full ordination in this Dhamma and discipline lives on probation for four months, and if at the end of the four months the bhikkhus, being satisfied with him, give him the going forth and full ordination as a bhikkhu, then I will live on probation for four years. At the end of the four years, if the bhikkhus are satisfied with me, let them give me the going forth and full ordination as a bhikkhu.”</p>

<p>Then the wanderer Sabhiya received the going forth under the Blessed One, he received full ordination . . . [as at I,4] . . . And the Venerable Sabhiya became one of the arahants.</p>
