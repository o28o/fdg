<h2>3:7 Sela</h2>

<p>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was traveling on tour among the Aṅguttarāpans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with [103] 1,250 bhikkhus, when eventually he arrived at a town of the Aṅguttarāpans named Āpaṇa.</p>

<p>The jaṭila Keṇiya heard: “The ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, traveling on tour among the Aṅguttarāpans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with 1,250 bhikkhus, has arrived at Āpaṇa. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: ‘That Blessed One is an arahant, perfectly enlightened, accomplished in clear knowledge and conduct, fortunate, knower of the world, unsurpassed trainer of persons to be tamed, teacher of devas and humans, the Enlightened One, the Blessed One. Having directly known and realized on his own this world with its devas, Māra, and Brahmā, this population with its ascetics and brahmins, its devas and humans, he makes it known to others. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in the beginning, <a id="calibre_link-1301" class="calibre1"></a>good in the middle, and good in the end, with meaning and phrasing; he reveals a spiritual life that is perfectly complete and pure.’ Now it is good to see such arahants.”</p>

<p>Then the jaṭila Keṇiya approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down at one side. As he sat there, the Blessed One instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened him with a talk on the Dhamma. Then, having been instructed, encouraged, inspired, and gladdened by the Blessed One with a talk on the Dhamma, the jaṭila Keṇiya said to the Blessed One: “Let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from me.”</p>

<p>When this was said, the Blessed One told him: “The Sangha of bhikkhus is large, Keṇiya, [104] consisting of 1,250 bhikkhus, and you place full confidence in the brahmins.”</p>

<p>A second time the jaṭila Keṇiya said to the Blessed One: “Although the Sangha of bhikkhus is large, Master Gotama, consisting of 1,250 bhikkhus, and although I place full confidence in the brahmins, still let Master Gotama, together with the Sangha of bhikkhus, consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” A second time the Blessed One told him: “The Sangha of bhikkhus is large, Keṇiya. . . .”</p>

<p>A third time the jaṭila Keṇiya said to the Blessed One: “Although the Sangha is large . . . still let Master Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus consent to accept tomorrow’s meal from me.” The Blessed One consented in silence.</p>

<p>Then, knowing that the Blessed One had consented, the jaṭila Keṇiya rose from his seat and went to his own hermitage where he addressed his friends and companions, his relatives and family members thus: “Hear me, my honored friends and companions, relatives and family members. I have invited the ascetic Gotama together with the Sangha of bhikkhus for tomorrow’s meal. Take care of the preparatory work for me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” his friends and companions, relatives and family members, replied. Then some dug out ovens, some chopped wood, some washed dishes, some set up a water jug, some prepared seats, while the jaṭila Keṇiya himself set up a pavilion.</p>

<p>Now on that occasion the brahmin Sela was staying at Āpaṇa. <a id="calibre_link-5681" class="calibre1"></a>[105] He was a master of the Three Vedas with their lexicon and rules of ritual, with their phonology and etymology, and with historical lore as the fifth; being skilled in philology and grammar, he was fully versed in natural philosophy and in the marks of a great man, and he was teaching the recitation of the hymns to three hundred brahmin students.</p>

<p>Now at the time the jaṭila Keṇiya had placed full confidence in the brahmin Sela. Then the brahmin Sela, while walking and wandering around for exercise attended by his three hundred brahmin students, came to Keṇiya’s hermitage. There he saw some jaṭilas of Keṇiya’s hermitage digging out ovens, some chopping wood, some washing dishes, some setting out water jugs, some preparing seats, and the jaṭila Keṇiya himself setting up a pavilion.</p>

<p>When he saw this, he asked the jaṭila Keṇiya: “Is Master Keṇiya to hold a marriage or a giving in marriage? Or is a great sacrifice in preparation? Or has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited with his troops for tomorrow’s meal?”</p>

<p>“I will not be holding a marriage or a giving in marriage, Master Sela, nor has King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha been invited with his troops for tomorrow’s meal, but I am preparing for a great sacrifice. The ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan family, while wandering on tour among the Anguttarāpans together with a large Sangha of bhikkhus, with 1,250 bhikkhus, has arrived at Āpaṇa. [106] Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: ‘That Blessed One is . . . the Enlightened One (Buddha), the Blessed One.’ He has been invited by me for tomorrow’s meal together with the Sangha of bhikkhus.”</p>

<hr>

<p>“Did you say ‘Buddha,’ Keṇiya?”</p>

<p>“I said ‘Buddha,’ Sela.”</p>

<p>“Did you say ‘Buddha,’ Keṇiya?”</p>

<p>“I said ‘Buddha,’ Sela.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Then it occurred to the brahmin Sela: “Even this sound ‘buddha’ is rarely encountered in the world. Now the thirty-two marks of a great man have come down in our hymns, and the great man who is endowed with them has only two possible destinies, no other. If he lives the home life, he becomes a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who rules by the Dhamma, a ruler of the four quarters, victorious, who has <a id="calibre_link-5682" class="calibre1"></a>attained stability in his country and possesses the seven gems. He has these seven gems: the wheel gem, the elephant gem, the horse gem, the jewel gem, the woman gem, the steward gem, and the governor gem as the seventh. His sons, who exceed a thousand, are brave and heroic and crush the armies of others. He rules over this earth bounded by the ocean, having conquered it by means of the Dhamma, without a rod, without a weapon. But if he goes forth from the home life into homelessness, he becomes an arahant, a perfectly enlightened buddha, whose coverings in the world are removed.”</p>

<p>[He then asked:] “My good Keṇiya, where is Master Gotama, the arahant, the perfectly enlightened one, now living?”</p>

<p>When this was said, the jaṭila Keṇiya extended his right arm and said to the brahmin Sela: [107] “There, by that green line of the grove, Master Sela.”</p>

<hr>

<p>Then the brahmin Sela together with the three hundred brahmin students approached the Blessed One. He addressed the brahmin students: “Come quietly, sirs, treading step by step; for these Blessed Ones are hard to approach, like lions that wander alone. And when I am speaking with the ascetic Gotama, do not break in and interrupt me, but wait until our talk is finished.”</p>

<p>Then the brahmin Sela approached the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, he sat down to one side. He then looked for the thirty-two marks of a great man on the Blessed One’s body. He saw most of the thirty-two marks of a great man on the Blessed One’s body, except two; he was perplexed and doubtful about two of the marks, and he could not decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to the Blessed One: “This brahmin Sela sees most of the thirty-two marks of a great man on me, except two; he is perplexed and doubtful about two of the marks, and he cannot decide and make up his mind about them: about the male organ being enclosed in a sheath and about the largeness of the tongue.”</p>

<p>Then the Blessed One performed such a feat of psychic potency that the brahmin Sela saw that his male organ was enclosed in a sheath. [108] Next the Blessed One stuck out his <a id="calibre_link-5683" class="calibre1"></a>tongue, and with it he repeatedly touched and stroked both ear holes and both nostrils, and he covered the whole of his forehead with his tongue.</p>
<p>Then the brahmin Sela thought: “The ascetic Gotama is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a great man; they are complete, not incomplete. Yet I do not know whether he is a buddha or not. However, I have heard aged brahmins advanced in years, the teachers of teachers, say that those who are arahants, perfectly enlightened ones, reveal themselves as such when their own praises are spoken. Let me extol the ascetic Gotama to his face with fitting verses.”</p>

<p>Then the brahmin Sela extolled the Blessed One to his face with fitting verses:</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">548</span>“You are perfect in body, delightful,<br>
well born and lovely to behold.<br>
O Blessed One, golden is your color,<br>
your teeth so white, you are full of vigor. (1)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">549</span>“The features possessed<br>
by a well-born man are all<br>
to be found on your body,<br>
these marks of a great man. (2)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">550</span>“With clear eyes, bright face,<br>
stately, erect as a flame,<br>
amid this group of ascetics<br>
you shine like the sun. (3)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">551</span>“A bhikkhu so lovely to look on<br>
with skin of a golden sheen &mdash;<br>
why do you, one of supreme beauty,<br>
adopt the state of an ascetic? (4)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">552</span>“You are fit to be a king,<br>
a wheel-turning monarch, lord of charioteers,<br>
a victor in all the four quarters,<br>
lord of the Jambu Continent. [109] (5)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">553</span>“With khattiyas and great princes<br>
all devoted to your service,<br>
as king above kings, as a ruler of people,<br>
you should exercise rulership, Gotama.” (6)</p>

<p><strong>(Sela,” the Blessed One said)</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">554</span>“I am already a king,<br>
“I am the unsurpassed king of the Dhamma,<br>
I turn the wheel by means of the Dhamma,<br>
the wheel that cannot be turned back.” (7)</p>

<p><strong>(The brahmin Sela said)</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">555</span>“You claim to be an enlightened one,”<br>
“You say, Gotama,<br>
‘I am the unsurpassed king of the Dhamma.<br>
I turn the wheel by means of the Dhamma.’ (8)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">556</span>“Who is your general, that disciple<br>
who follows after the Teacher?<br>
Who is it who helps you turn<br>
this wheel that you set in motion?” (9)</p>

<p><strong>(Sela,” the Blessed One replied)</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">557</span>“The wheel set in motion by me,<br>
“the unsurpassed wheel of Dhamma,<br>
Sāriputta, the Tathāgata’s offspring,<br>
helps to keep turning. (10)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">558</span>“What should be directly known is directly known,<br>
what should be developed has been developed,<br>
what should be abandoned has been abandoned:<br>
therefore, brahmin, I am a buddha. (11)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">559</span>“So remove your doubt about me<br>
and be convinced, brahmin!<br>
For it is rare to gain the sight<br>
of the enlightened ones. (12) [110]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">560</span>“I am one whose appearance<br>
is rarely encountered in the world.<br>
I am the Enlightened One,<br>
brahmin, the unsurpassed surgeon. (13)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">561</span>“I have become Brahmā, peerless,<br>
one who has crushed Māra’s army.<br>
Having mastered all my enemies,<br>
I rejoice, without fear from anywhere.” (14)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">562</span>“Sirs, hear this,” (said Sela),<br>
“as the One with Vision has spoken,<br>
the surgeon, the mighty hero,<br>
who roars like a lion in the forest. (15)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">563</span>“Who having seen him, even one of dark birth,<br>
would not place confidence in him,<br>
the one who has become Brahmā, incomparable,<br>
the one who has crushed Māra’s army? (16)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">564</span>“Whoever wishes may follow me;<br>
who does not wish to may depart.<br>
Here I will go forth under him,<br>
this man of excellent wisdom.” (17)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">565</span>“If, sir, you now approve of the teaching<br>
of the Perfectly Enlightened One,<br>
we too will go forth under him,<br>
this man of excellent wisdom.” (18)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">566</span>“There are three hundred brahmins here<br>
who implore you, making salutations.<br>
Let us live the spiritual life<br>
under you, O Blessed One.” (19)</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>(Sela,” said the Blessed One)</strong></p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">567</span>“The spiritual life is well proclaimed,<br>
“directly visible, immediate,<br>
where the going forth will not be barren<br>
for one who trains heedfully.” (20)<br>
<p>Then the brahmin Sela and his assembly received the going forth under the Blessed One, and they received the full ordination.</p>

<p>Then, when the night had ended, the jaṭila Keṇiya had good <a id="calibre_link-5684" class="calibre1"></a>food of various kinds prepared in his own hermitage [111] and had the time announced to the Blessed One: “It is time, Master Gotama, the meal is ready.” Then, in the morning, the Blessed One dressed, and taking his bowl and outer robe, he went with the Sangha of bhikkhus to the hermitage of the jaṭila Keṇiya and sat down on the seat made ready. </p>

<p>Then, with his own hands, the jaṭila Keṇiya served and satisfied the Sangha of bhikkhus headed by the Buddha with various kinds of good food. When the Blessed One had eaten and had put aside his bowl, the jaṭila Keṇiya took a low seat and sat down on one side. Thereupon the Blessed One expressed appreciation with these verses:</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">568</span>“Fire offerings are the best of sacrifices,<br>
Sāvittī the best of Vedic hymns.<br>
The best of human beings is a king,<br>
the sea the best for flowing rivers. (21)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">569</span>“The moon is the best of celestial bodies,<br>
the sun the best of things that shine.<br>
For those desiring merit, the Sangha<br>
is best for those who sacrifice.” (22)</p>

<hr>

<p>When the Blessed One had expressed his appreciation with these stanzas, he rose from his seat and departed.</p>

<p>Then, the Venerable Sela and his assembly, dwelling alone, withdrawn, heedful, ardent, and resolute, before long [112] realized for themselves with direct knowledge, in this very life, that unsurpassed consummation of the spiritual life for the sake of which clansmen rightly go forth from the household life into homelessness, and having entered upon it, they dwelled in it. They directly knew: “Finished is birth, the spiritual life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is no more coming back to any state of being.” And the Venerable Sela together with his assembly became arahants.</p>

<hr>

<p>Then the Venerable Sela together with his assembly approached the Blessed One. Having arranged his upper robe on one shoulder, extending his hands in reverential salutation toward the Blessed One, the Venerable Sela addressed him with verses:</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">570</span>“This is the eighth day, One with Vision,<br>
since we went to you for refuge.<br>
In these seven nights, Blessed One,<br>
we have been tamed in your teaching. (23)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">571</span>“You are the Buddha, you are the Teacher,<br>
you are the muni, the conqueror of Māra.<br>
Having cut off the latent tendencies,<br>
crossed over, you lead this population across.<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">The verse is identical with verse 545.</span></span></span> (24)</p>
