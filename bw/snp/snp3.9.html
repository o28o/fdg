<h2>3:9 Vāseṭṭha</h2>

<p>Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was dwelling at Icchānaṅgala, in a woodland grove near Icchānaṅgala. Now on that occasion a number of very well-known affluent brahmins were staying at Icchānaṅgala, that is, the brahmin Caṅkī, the brahmin Tārukkha, the brahmin Pokkharasāti, the brahmin Jāṇussoṇi, the brahmin Todeyya, and other very well-known affluent brahmins.</p>

<p>Then, while the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were walking and wandering for exercise, this chance conversation arose between them: “How, sir, is one a brahmin?” </p>

<p>The brahmin student Bhāradvāja said: “When one is well born on both his maternal and paternal sides, of pure descent as far back as the seventh generation of ancestors, unassailable and impeccable with respect to birth, then one is a brahmin.” </p>

<p>The brahmin student Vāseṭṭha said: “When one is of good behavior and proficient in the observances, then one is a brahmin.” But Bhāradvāja could not [116] convince Vāseṭṭha, nor could Vāseṭṭha convince Bhāradvāja.</p>

<p>Then the brahmin student Vāseṭṭha addressed the brahmin student Bhāradvāja: “Good<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Reading <i>bho</i> in place of <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> <i>kho</i>.</span></span></span> Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama, the son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, is dwelling at Icchānaṅgala, in the woodland grove near Icchānaṅgala. Now a good report about that Master Gotama has circulated thus: ‘That Blessed One is . . . the Enlightened One, the Blessed One.’ Come, good Bhāradvāja, let us go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him about this matter. As he answers, so we will retain it in mind.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the brahmin student Bhāradvāja replied.</p>

<p>Then the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja went to the Blessed One and exchanged greetings with him. When they had concluded their greetings and cordial talk, they sat down to one side. The brahmin student Vāseṭṭha then addressed the Blessed One in verses thus:</p>
