<h2>3:9 With Vāseṭṭha</h2>

<p>So I have heard:</p>

<p>At one time the Buddha was staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. Now at that time several very well-known well-to-do brahmins were residing in Icchānaṅgala. They included the brahmins Caṅkī, Tārukkha, Pokkharasāti, Jāṇussoṇi, Todeyya, and others.</p>

<hr>

<p>Then as the brahmin students Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja were going for a walk they began to discuss the question: “How do you become a brahmin?” </p>
<p>Bhāradvāja said this: “When you’re well born on both your mother’s and father’s side, of pure descent, irrefutable and impeccable in questions of ancestry back to the seventh paternal generation—then you’re a brahmin.” </p>

<p>Vāseṭṭha said this: “When you’re ethical and accomplished in doing your duties—then you’re a brahmin.” But neither was able to persuade the other. </p>

<hr>

<p>So Vāseṭṭha said to Bhāradvāja, 
“Master Bhāradvāja, the ascetic Gotama—a Sakyan, gone forth from a Sakyan family—is staying in a forest near Icchānaṅgala. He has this good reputation: ‘That Blessed One is perfected, a fully awakened Buddha, accomplished in knowledge and conduct, holy, knower of the world, supreme guide for those who wish to train, teacher of gods and humans, awakened, blessed.’ Come, let’s go to see him and ask him about this matter. As he answers, so we’ll remember it.”

<hr>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Bhāradvāja. </p>

<p>So they went to the Buddha and exchanged greetings with him. 
When the greetings and polite conversation were over, they sat down to one side, 
and Vāseṭṭha addressed the Buddha in verse: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p><span class="speaker">Vāseṭṭha</span></p>

<p><span class="parno">594</span>
“We’re both authorized masters 
<br>of the three Vedas. 
<br>I’m a student of Pokkharasāti, 
<br>and he of Tārukkha. </p>

<p id="p595"><span class="parno">595</span>
We’re fully qualified 
<br>in all the Vedic experts teach. 
<br>As philologists and grammarians, 
<br>we match our teachers in recitation. </p>

<p id="p596"><span class="parno">596</span>
We have a dispute 
<br>regarding the question of ancestry. 
<br>For Bhāradvāja says that 
<br>one is a brahmin due to birth, 
<br>but I declare it’s because of one’s actions. 
<br>Oh seer, know this as our debate. </p>

<p id="p597"><span class="parno">597</span>
Since neither of us was able 
<br>to convince the other, 
<br>we’ve come to ask you, sir, 
<br>renowned as the awakened one. </p>

<p id="p598"><span class="parno">598</span>
As people honor with joined palms 
<br>the moon on the cusp of waxing, 
<br>bowing, they revere 
<br>Gotama in the world. </p>

<p id="p599"><span class="parno">599</span>
We ask this of Gotama, 
<br>the eye arisen in the world: 
<br>is one a brahmin due to birth, 
<br>or else because of actions? 
<br>We don’t know, please tell us, 
<br>so we can recognize a brahmin.” </p>
