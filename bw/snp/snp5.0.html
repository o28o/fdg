<h2>5:0 Introductory Verses</h2>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">976</span>Desiring the state of nothingness,<br>
a brahmin master of the hymns<br>
went from the delightful city of the Kosalans<br>
to a region in the south. (1)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">977</span>In the domain of Assaka,<br>
in the neighborhood of Aḷaka,<br>
he lived on the bank of the Godhāvarī River<br>
by means of gleaning and fruit. (2)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">978</span>Situated nearby<br>
there was a large village.<br>
With the revenue that arose from it,<br>
he held a grand sacrifice. (3)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">979</span>Having completed the grand sacrifice,<br>
he again entered the hermitage.<br>
When he had re-entered,<br>
another brahmin arrived. (4)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">980</span>He had calloused feet, he was thirsty;<br>
he had dirty teeth and a dusty head.<br>
Having approached [his host],<br>
[the visitor] asked for five hundred [coins]. (5)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">981</span>Having beheld him,<br>
Bāvari<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">I follow <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span>, which has the name as <i>Bāvari</i>, followed too by Norman. <span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> and <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> have the name as <i>Bāvarī</i>.</span></span></span> invited him to a seat.<br>
He asked about his happiness and health,<br>
and spoke this statement: (6)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">982</span>“Whatever wealth I had to give away,<br>
I have disposed of it all.<br>
Believe me, brahmin:<br>
I do not have five hundred [coins].” (7) [191]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">983</span>“When I am making this request,<br>
if you do not present it to me,<br>
on the seventh day from now<br>
may your head split into seven parts.” (8)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">984</span>Having put on a performance,<br>
that charlatan uttered a fearsome curse.<br>
Having heard his statement,<br>
Bāvari was despondent. (9)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">985</span>Not eating, he became emaciated,<br>
stricken by the dart of sorrow.<br>
Then, in such a state of mind,<br>
he did not delight in meditation. (10)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">986</span>Having seen him terrified and despondent,<br>
a deity who desired his good<br>
approached Bāvari<br>
and uttered this statement: (11)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">987</span>“That charlatan who desires wealth<br>
does not understand the head.<br>
He has no knowledge at all<br>
about the head or head-splitting.” (12)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">988</span>“If you know, worthy one,<br>
please inform me when you are asked<br>
about the head and head-splitting:<br>
let us hear that word of yours.” (13)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">989</span>“I too do not know this matter;<br>
I have no knowledge at all of this.<br>
For the head and head-splitting:<br>
this is what the conquerors have seen.” (14)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">990</span>“Then, on this circle of the earth,<br>
who knows about the head<br>
and head-splitting?<br>
Tell me this, O deity!” (15) [192]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">991</span>“Earlier already the world-leader,<br>
a descendent of King Okkāka,<br>
a Sakyan son, the maker of light, (16)<br>
went forth from Kapilavatthu.</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">992</span>“He, brahmin, is the Enlightened One<br>
who has gone beyond all phenomena,<br>
who has attained all superknowledge and power,<br>
the one with vision into all phenomena.<br>
Having attained the destruction of all kamma,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Reading with <span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> and <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span> <i>sabbakammakkhayaṃ</i>. <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> <i>sabbadhammakkhayaṃ</i> should be corrected accordingly.</span></span></span><br>
he is liberated in the extinction of acquisitions. (17)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">993</span>“The Buddha, the Blessed One in the world,<br>
the One with Vision, teaches the Dhamma.<br>
Go to him and ask him your question:<br>
he will explain that matter to you.” (18)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">994</span>Having heard the word<br>
“Enlightened One,” Bāvari was elated.<br>
His sorrow diminished,<br>
and he gained abundant rapture. (19)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">995</span>Delighted, elated, exhilarated,<br>
Bāvari asked that deity:<br>
“In what village or town, or in what country,<br>
does the World Protector dwell,<br>
where we might go and pay homage<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Reading with <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span> and <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> <i>namassemu</i> as againt <span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> <i>passemu</i>, “might see.”</span></span></span><br>
to the Enlightened One, the best of bipeds?” (20)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">996</span>“The conqueror is in Sāvatthī, in the realm of Kosala;<br>
[there dwells] the one of abundant wisdom, of excellent vast intelligence.<br>
That Sakyan son, unrivaled, free of influxes, bull of men,<br>
is one who understands head-splitting.” (21)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">997</span>He then addressed his pupils,<br>
brahmins who had mastered the hymns:<br>
“Come, brahmin students, I will speak.<br>
Listen to this word of mine. (22) [193]</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">998</span>“Now there has arisen in the world<br>
one famed as ‘the Enlightened One,’<br>
one whose manifestation in the world<br>
is rarely encountered.<br>
Go quickly to Sāvatthī<br>
and see the best of bipeds.” (23)</p>

<p class="verse"><span class ="parno">999</span>“When we see him, brahmin,<br>
how might we know that he is the Buddha?<br>
Since we do not know, tell us<br>
how we might recognize him.” (24)</p>

<p class="verse">1000. “The characteristics of a great man<br>
have come down in the hymns.<br>
Thirty-two such marks are explained<br>
complete in their sequence. (25)</p>

<p class="verse">1001. “For one whose body has these<br>
characteristics of a great man,<br>
there are only two destinations;<br>
for a third does not exist. (26)</p>

<p class="verse">1002. “If he dwells at home,<br>
having conquered this earth<br>
without violence, without a weapon,<br>
he rules over it righteously. (27)</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse">1003. “But if he should go forth<br>
from home to homelessness,<br>
<a id="calibre_link-999" class="calibre1"></a>
he becomes a buddha with coverings removed,<br>
an unsurpassed arahant. (28)</p>

<p class="verse">1004. “Ask him solely with your mind<br>
about [my] birth, clan, characteristics,<br>
hymns, and pupils, and ask further<br>
about the head and head-splitting. (29)</p>

<p class="verse">1005. “If he is a buddha,<br>
one of unobstructed vision,<br>
he will reply verbally<br>
to the questions asked by the mind.” (30)</p>

<p class="verse">1006. Having heard the word of Bāvari,<br>
his sixteen brahmin pupils &mdash;<br>
Ajita, Tissa Metteyya,<br>
Puṇṇaka, and Mettagū, (31) [194]</p>

<p class="verse">1007. Dhotaka and Upasīva,<br>
Nanda and Hemaka,<br>
the pair Todeyya and Kappa,<br>
and the wise Jatukaṇṇī, (32)</p>

<p class="verse">1008. Bhadrāvudha and Udaya,<br>
and the brahmin Posāla,<br>
the intelligent Mogharāja,<br>
and the great rishi Piṅgiya &mdash; (33)</p>

<p class="verse">1009. all leaders of their own groups,<br>
famed throughout the whole world,<br>
meditators who delighted in the jhānas,<br>
who had formed past habitual formations, (34)</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse">1010. paid homage to Bāvari,<br>
and having circumambulated him,<br>
all with matted locks, wearing hides,<br>
they set out toward the north &mdash; (35)</p>


<p class="verse">1011. to Patiṭṭhāna of Aḷaka,<br>
then to the former Māhissatī,<br>
to Ujjenī and Gonaddhā,<br>
Vedisā, and Vanasa, (36)</p>

<p class="verse">1012. to Kosambī and Sāketa,<br>
the supreme city Sāvatthī,<br>
Setavya and Kapilavatthu,<br>
and the city Kusinārā, (37)</p>

<p class="verse">1013. on to Pāvā and Bhoga city,<br>
to Vesālī, to the Māgadhan city [Rājagaha],<br>
and to the Pāsāṇaka Cetiya,<br>
delightful and charming. (38) [195]</p>

<p class="verse">1014. As a thirsty person [seeks] cool water,<br>
as a merchant [seeks] great profit,<br>
or one oppressed by heat [seeks] shade,<br>
they hastily climbed the mountain. (39)</p>

<p class="verse">1015. On that occasion the Blessed One<br>
in front of the Sangha of bhikkhus<br>
was teaching the Dhamma to the bhikkhus<br>
like a lion that roars in the woods. (40)</p>

<p class="verse">1016. Ajita saw the Buddha,<br>
like the glorious sun with a hundred rays,<span class="note"><span class="details"><span class="p">Reading with <span class="var" title="Sinhala-script edition">Ce</span> <i>sataraṃsiva</i> (<span class="var" title="Burmese-script edition">Be</span> <i>sataraṃsiṃ va</i>). Norman accepts <span class="var" title="Roman-script edition">Ee</span> <i>vītaraṃsi va</i>, but <i>sataraṃsi</i> occurs elsewhere: <i>suvaṇṇavaṇṇaṃ sambuddhaṃ, sataraṃsiṃva bhāṇumaṃ</i> at <span class="var" title="Apadāna">Ap </span>I 130, I 146, and <i>suvaṇṇavaṇṇaṃ sambuddhaṃ, sataraṃsiṃva uggataṃ</i> at I 191.</span></span></span><br>
like the moon on the fifteenth [of the fortnight]<br>
when it has arrived at fullness. (41)</p>

<p class="verse">1017. Then, having seen his body<br>
and his features complete,<br>
he stood to one side, thrilled,<br>
and asked the questions mentally: (42)</p>

<p class="verse">1018. “Speak with reference to his birth;<br>
tell his clan and characteristics;<br>
tell his perfection in the hymns.<br>
How many pupils does the brahmin teach?” (43)</p>

<p class="verse">1019. “His age is a hundred and twenty years,<br>
and by clan he is a Bāvari;<br>
there are three characteristics on his body;<br>
he is a master of the Three Vedas, (44)</p>

<p class="verse">1020. “of the characteristics and histories,<br>
along with the lexicon and rules of ritual.<br>
He teaches five hundred pupils;<br>
he has reached perfection in his own teaching.” (45) [196]</p>

<p class="verse">1021. “O supreme man, reveal in detail<br>
the characteristics of Bāvari.<br>
O you who have cut off craving,<br>
do not let doubt remain in us!” (46)</p>

<hr>

<p class="verse">1022. “He can cover his face with his tongue;<br>
he has a tuft of hair between his eyebrows;<br>
his male organ is enclosed in a sheath:<br>
know thus, brahmin student.” (47)</p>

<p class="verse">1023. Having heard the questions answered<br>
without having heard anything being asked,<br>
exhilarated, making salutations,<br>
all the people wondered: (48)</p>

<p class="verse">1024. “Was it a deva or Brahmā,<br>
or even Indra, the husband of Sujā,<br>
who asked those questions with the mind?<br>
To whom did he reply?” (49)</p>

<p class="verse">1025. “Bāvari asks about the head<br>
and the splitting of the head.<br>
Explain this, Blessed One!<br>
Remove our doubt, O rishi!” (50)</p>

<p class="verse">1026. “Know ignorance to be ‘the head’;<br>
clear knowledge is ‘head-splitting’<br>
when conjoined with faith, mindfulness,<br>
concentration, desire, and energy.” (51)</p>

<p class="verse">1027. Thereupon the brahmin student,<br>
uplifted by great exhilaration,<br>
arranged his cloak over one shoulder<br>
and fell with his head at the Buddha’s feet. (52)</p>

<p class="verse">1028. “The brahmin Bāvari, dear sir,<br>
together with his pupils,<br>
exultant in mind, joyful,<br>
worships your feet, One with Vision.” (53) [197]</p>

<p class="verse">1029. “May the brahmin Bāvari be happy,<br>
together with his pupils.<br>
May you too be happy!<br>
May you live long, brahmin student! (54)</p>

<p class="verse">1030. “Whatever doubt Bāvari has,<br>
and you, or all the others &mdash;<br>
you are given permission, so ask<br>
whatever you wish in your mind.” (55)</p>

<p class="verse">1031. Given permission by the Buddha,<br>
Ajita sat down, and making salutation,<br>
he there asked the Tathāgata<br>
the very first question. (56)</p>
