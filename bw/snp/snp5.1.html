<h2>5:1 Introductory Verses</h2>

<p class="verse" id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>
From the fair city of the Kosalans 
<br>to the southern region 
<br>came a brahmin expert in hymns, 
<br>aspiring to nothingness. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>
In the domain of Assaka, 
<br>close by Aḷaka, 
<br>he lived on the bank of the Godhāvarī River, 
<br>getting by on gleanings and fruit. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>
He was supported 
<br>by a prosperous village nearby. 
<br>With the revenue earned from there 
<br>he performed a great sacrifice. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>
When he had completed the great sacrifice, 
<br>he returned to his hermitage once more. 
<br>Upon his return, 
<br>another brahmin arrived. </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>
Foot-sore and thirsty, 
<br>with grotty teeth and dusty head, 
<br>he approached the other 
<br>and asked for five hundred coins. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>
When Bāvari saw him, 
<br>he invited him to sit down, 
<br>asked of his happiness and well-being, 
<br>and said the following. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>
“Whatever I had available to give, 
<br>I have already distributed. 
<br>Believe me, brahmin, 
<br>I don’t have five hundred coins.” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>
“If, good sir, you do not 
<br>give me what I ask, 
<br>then on the seventh day, 
<br>let your head explode in seven!” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>
After performing a ritual, 
<br>that charlatan uttered his dreadful curse. 
<br>When he heard these words, 
<br>Bāvari became distressed. </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>
Not eating, he grew emaciated, 
<br>stricken by the dart of sorrow. 
<br>And in such a state of mind, 
<br>he could not enjoy absorption. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>
Seeing him anxious and distraught, 
<br>a goddess wishing to help, 
<br>approached Bāvari 
<br>and said the following. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>
“That charlatan understands nothing 
<br>about the head, he only wants money. 
<br>When it comes to heads or head-splitting, 
<br>he has no knowledge at all.” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>
“Madam, surely you must know—
<br>please answer my question. 
<br>Let me hear what you say 
<br>about heads and head-splitting.” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>
“I too do not know that, 
<br>I have no knowledge in that matter. 
<br>When it comes to heads or head-splitting, 
<br>it is the Victors who have vision.” </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>
“Then, in all this vast territory, 
<br>who exactly does know 
<br>about heads and head-splitting? 
<br>Please tell me, goddess.” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>
“From the city of Kapilavatthu 
<br>the World Leader has gone forth. 
<br>He is a scion of King Okkāka, 
<br>a Sakyan, and a beacon. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>
For he, brahmin, is the Awakened One! 
<br>He has gone beyond all things; 
<br>he has attained to all knowledge and power; 
<br>he is the seer into all things, 
<br>he has attained the end of all deeds; 
<br>he is freed with the ending of attachments. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>
That Buddha, the Blessed One in the world, 
<br>the Seer, teaches Dhamma. 
<br>Go to him and ask—
<br>he will answer you.” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>
When he heard the word “Buddha”, 
<br>Bāvari was elated. 
<br>His sorrow faded, 
<br>and he was filled to brimming with joy. </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>
Uplifted, elated, and inspired, 
<br>Bāvari questioned that goddess: 
<br>“But in what village or town, 
<br>or in what land is the protector of the world, 
<br>where we may go and pay respects 
<br>to the Awakened One, best of men?” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>
“Near Sāvatthī, the home of the Kosalans, is the Victor 
<br>abounding in wisdom, vast in intelligence. 
<br>That Sakyan is indefatigable, free of defilements, a bull among men: 
<br>he understands head-splitting. </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>
Therefore he addressed his pupils, 
<br>brahmins who had mastered the hymns: 
<br>“Come, students, I shall speak. 
<br>Listen to what I say. 
<br>Today has arisen in the world 
<br>one whose appearance in the world 
<br>is hard to find again—
<br>he is renowned as the Awakened One. 
<br>Quickly go to Sāvatthī 
<br>and see the best of men.” </p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>
“Brahmin, how exactly are we to know 
<br>the Buddha when we see him? 
<br>We don’t know, please tell us, 
<br>so we can recognize him.” </p>
</div>

<p class="verse" id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>
“The marks of a great man 
<br>have been handed down in our hymns. 
<br>Thirty-two have been described, 
<br>complete and in order. </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>
One upon whose body is found 
<br>these marks of a great man 
<br>has two possible destinies, 
<br>there is no third. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>
If he stays at home, 
<br>having conquered this land 
<br>without rod or sword, 
<br>he shall govern by principle. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>
But if he goes forth 
<br>from the lay life to homelessness, 
<br>he becomes an Awakened One, a perfected one, 
<br>with veil drawn back, supreme. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>
Ask him about my birth, clan, and marks, 
<br>my hymns and students; and further, 
<br>about heads and head-splitting—
<br>but do so only in your mind! </p>

<p class="verse" id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>
If he is the Buddha 
<br>of unobstructed vision, 
<br>he will answer with his voice 
<br>the questions in your mind.” </p>
<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>
Sixteen brahmin pupils 
<br>heard what Bāvari said: 
<br>Ajita, Tissametteyya, 
<br>Puṇṇaka and Mettagū, </p>

<p class="verse" id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>
Dhotaka and Upasīva, 
<br>Nanda and then Hemaka, 
<br>both Todeyya and Kappa, 
<br>and Jatukaṇṇī the astute, </p>

<p class="verse" id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>
Bhadrāvudha and Udaya, 
<br>and the brahmin Posāla, 
<br>Mogharājā the intelligent, 
<br>and Piṅgiya the great hermit. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>
Each of them had their own following, 
<br>they were renowned the whole world over. 
<br>Those wise ones, meditators who love absorption, 
<br>were redolent with the potential of their past deeds. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>
Having bowed to Bāvari, 
<br>and circled him to his right, 
<br>they set out for the north, 
<br>with their dreadlocks and hides. </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>
First to Patiṭṭhāna of Aḷaka, 
<br>then on to the city of Mahissati; 
<br>to Ujjenī and Gonaddhā, 
<br>and Vedisa, and Vanasa. </p>


<p class="verse" id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>
Then to Kosambi and Sāketa, 
<br>and the supreme city of Sāvatthī; 
<br>on they went to Setavyā and Kapilavatthu, 
<br>and the homestead at Kusinārā. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>
To Pāvā they went, and Bhoganagara, 
<br>and on to Vesālī and the Magadhan city. 
<br>Finally they reached the Pāsāṇaka shrine, 
<br>fair and delightful. </p>

<p class="verse"><a class="parno" id="p38">38</a>
Like a thirsty person to cool water, 
<br>like a merchant to great profit, 
<br>like a heat-struck person to shade, 
<br>they quickly climbed the mountain. </p>


<p class="verse" id="p39"><span class="parno">39</span>
At that time the Buddha 
<br>at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha, 
<br>was teaching the mendicants the Dhamma, 
<br>like a lion roaring in the jungle. </p>


<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p40"><span class="parno">40</span>
Ajita saw the Buddha, 
<br>like the sun shining with a hundred rays, 
<br>like the moon on the fifteenth day 
<br>when it has come into its fullness. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>
Then he saw his body, 
<br>complete in all features. 
<br>Thrilled, he stood to one side 
<br>and asked this question in his mind. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>
“Speak about the brahmin’s birth; 
<br>of his clan; and his own marks; 
<br>what hymns is he proficient in; 
<br>and how many he teaches.” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>
“His age is a hundred and twenty. 
<br>By clan he is a Bāvari. 
<br>There are three marks on his body. 
<br>He is a master of the three Vedas, </p>

<p class="verse" id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>
the teachings on the marks, the testaments, 
<br>the vocabularies, and the rituals. 
<br>He teaches five hundred, 
<br>and has reached proficiency in his own teaching.” </p>


<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p45"><span class="parno">45</span>
“O supreme person, cutter of craving, 
<br>please reveal in detail 
<br>Bāvari’s marks—
<br>let us doubt no longer!” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p46"><span class="parno">46</span>
“He can cover his face with his tongue; 
<br>there is a tuft of hair between his eyebrows; 
<br>his private parts are concealed in a foreskin: 
<br>know them as this, young man.” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p47"><span class="parno">47</span>
Hearing the answers 
<br>without having heard any questions, 
<br>all the people, inspired, 
<br>with joined palms, wondered: </p>

<p class="verse" id="p48"><span class="parno">48</span>
“Who is it that asked a question with their mind? 
<br>Was it a god or Brahmā? 
<br>Or Indra, Sujā’s husband? 
<br>To whom does the Buddha reply?” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p49"><span class="parno">49</span>
“Bāvari asks 
<br>about heads and head-splitting. 
<br>May the Buddha please answer, 
<br>and so, O hermit, dispel our doubt.” </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>
“Know ignorance as the head, 
<br>and knowledge as the head-splitter, 
<br>when joined with faith, mindfulness, and immersion, 
<br>and enthusiasm and energy.” </p>


<p class="verse" id="p51"><span class="parno">51</span>
At that, the brahmin student, 
<br>full of inspiration, 
<br>arranged his antelope-skin cloak over one shoulder, 
<br>and fell with his head to the Buddha’s feet. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p52"><span class="parno">52</span>
“Good sir, the brahmin Bāvari 
<br>together with his pupils, 
<br>elated and happy, 
<br>bows to your feet, O seer!” </p>

<p class="verse" id="p53"><span class="parno">53</span>
“May the brahmin Bāvari be happy, 
<br>together with his pupils. 
<br>And may you, too, be happy! 
<br>May you live long, young man. </p>

<p class="verse" id="p54"><span class="parno">54</span>
To Bāvari and you all 
<br>I grant the opportunity to clear up all doubt. 
<br>Please ask 
<br>whatever you want.” </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse" id="p55"><span class="parno">55</span>
Granted the opportunity by the Buddha, 
<br>they sat down with joined palms. 
<br>Ajita asked the Realized One 
<br>the first question right there. </p>
