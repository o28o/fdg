<div class="verse">
<p id="p527"><span class="parno">527</span>“The trees are now crimson, venerable sir,
	<br>they’ve shed their foliage, and are ready to fruit.
	<br>They’re splendid, as if aflame;
	<br>great hero, this season is full of flavor.</p>

<p id="p528"><span class="parno">528</span>The blossoming trees are delightful,
	<br>wafting their scent all around, in all directions.
	<br>They’ve shed their leaves and wish to fruit,
	<br>hero, it is time to depart from here.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p529"><span class="parno">529</span>It is neither too hot nor too cold,
	<br>venerable sir, it’s a pleasant season for traveling.
	<br>Let the Sākiyans and Koliyans see you,
	<br>heading west across the Rohiṇī river.</p>

<p id="p530"><span class="parno">530</span>In hope, the field is plowed;
	<br>the seed is sown in hope;
	<br>in hope, merchants travel the seas,
	<br>carrying rich cargoes.
	<br>The hope that I stand for:
	<br>may it succeed!</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p531"><span class="parno">531</span>Again and again, they sow the seed;
	<br>again and again, the king of the heavens sends rain;
	<br>again and again, farmers plow the field;
	<br>again and again, grain is produced for the nation.</p>

<p id="p532"><span class="parno">532</span>Again and again, the beggars wander,
	<br>again and again, the donors give.
	<br>Again and again, when the donors have given,
	<br>again and again, they take their place in heaven.</p>

<p id="p533"><span class="parno">533</span>A hero of vast wisdom purifies seven generations
	<br>of the family in which they’re born.
	<br>Sakya, I believe you’re the king of kings,
	<br>since you fathered the one who is truly called a sage.</p>

<p id="p534"><span class="parno">534</span>The father of the great seer is named Suddhodana;
	<br>and the Buddha’s mother is named Māyā.
	<br>Having borne the Bodhisatta in her belly,
	<br>she rejoices in the heaven of the thirty-three.</p>

<p id="p535"><span class="parno">535</span>When she died and passed away from here,
	<br>she was blessed with heavenly sensual pleasures;
	<br>enjoying the five kinds of sensual stimulation.
	<br>Gotamī is surrounded by those hosts of gods.”</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p536"><span class="parno">536</span>“I’m the son of the Buddha, the incomparable Aṅgīrasa,
	<br>the unaffected,
	<br>the bearer of the unbearable.
	<br>You, Sakya, are my father’s father;
	<br>Gotama, you are my grandfather in the Dhamma.”</p>
</div>

<h5>Ekavihāriya</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p537"><span class="parno">537</span>If no-one else is found
	<br>in front or behind,
	<br>it’s extremely pleasant
	<br>to be dwelling alone in a forest grove.</p>

<p id="p538"><span class="parno">538</span>Come now, I’ll go alone
	<br>to the wilderness praised by the Buddha.
	<br>It’s pleasant for a mendicant
	<br>to be dwelling alone and resolute.</p>

<p id="p539"><span class="parno">539</span>Alone and self-disciplined,
	<br>I’ll quickly enter the delightful forest,
	<br>which gives joy to meditators,
	<br>and is frequented by rutting elephants.</p>

<p id="p540"><span class="parno">540</span>In the Cool Grove, so full of flowers,
	<br>in a cool mountain cave,
	<br>I’ll bathe my limbs
	<br>and walk mindfully alone.</p>

<p id="p541"><span class="parno">541</span>When will I dwell alone,
	<br>without a companion,
	<br>in the great wood, so delightful,
	<br>my task complete, free of defilements?</p>

<p id="p542"><span class="parno">542</span>This is what I want to do:
	<br>may my wish succeed!
	<br>I’ll make it happen myself,
	<br>for no-one can do another’s duty.</p>

<p id="p543"><span class="parno">543</span>Fastening my armor,
	<br>I’ll enter the forest.
	<br>I won’t leave
	<br>without attaining the end of defilements.</p>

<p id="p544"><span class="parno">544</span>As the cool breeze blows
	<br>with fragrant scent,
	<br>I’ll split ignorance apart,
	<br>sitting on the mountain-peak.</p>

<p id="p545"><span class="parno">545</span>In a forest grove covered with blossoms,
	<br>in a cave so very cool,
	<br>I take pleasure in the Mountainfold,
	<br>happy with the happiness of freedom.</p>

<p id="p546"><span class="parno">546</span>I’ve got all I wished for
	<br>like the moon on the fifteenth day.
	<br>With the utter ending of all defilements,
	<br>now there’ll be no more future lives.</p>
</div>

<h5>Mahākappina</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p547"><span class="parno">547</span>If you’re prepared for the future,
	<br>both the good and the bad,
	<br>then those, whether enemies or well-wishers,
	<br>who examine you for weakness will see none.</p>

<p id="p548"><span class="parno">548</span>One who has fulfilled, developed,
	<br>and gradually consolidated
	<br>mindfulness of breathing
	<br>as it was taught by the Buddha:
	<br>they light up the world,
	<br>like the moon freed from clouds.</p>

<p id="p549"><span class="parno">549</span>Yes, my mind is clean,
	<br>limitless and well-developed;
	<br>it has broken through and been uplifted—
	<br>it radiates in every direction.</p>

<p id="p550"><span class="parno">550</span>A wise person lives on
	<br>even after loss of wealth;
	<br>but without gaining wisdom,
	<br>even a rich person doesn’t really live.</p>

<p id="p551"><span class="parno">551</span>Wisdom questions what is learned;
	<br>wisdom grows fame and reputation;
	<br>a person who has wisdom
	<br>finds happiness even among sufferings.</p>

<p id="p552"><span class="parno">552</span>It’s not a teaching just for today;
	<br>it isn’t incredible or amazing.
	<br>When you’re born, you die—
	<br>what’s amazing about that?</p>

<p id="p553"><span class="parno">553</span>For anyone who is born,
	<br>death always follows after life.
	<br>Everyone who is born here dies here;
	<br>such is the nature of living creatures.</p>

<p id="p554"><span class="parno">554</span>The things that are useful for the living
	<br>are of no use for the dead—not fame, not celebrity,
	<br>not praise by ascetics and brahmins.
	<br>For the dead, there is only weeping.</p>

<p id="p555"><span class="parno">555</span>And weeping impairs the eye and the body;
	<br>complexion, health, and intelligence decline.
	<br>Your enemies rejoice;
	<br>but your well-wishers are not happy.</p>

<p id="p556"><span class="parno">556</span>So you should wish that those who stay in your family
	<br>have intelligence and learning,
	<br>and do their duty through the power of wisdom,
	<br>just as you’d cross a full river by boat.</p>
</div>

<h5>Cūḷapanthaka</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p557"><span class="parno">557</span>My progress was slow,
	<br>I was despised in the past.
	<br>Even my brother turned me away,
	<br>saying, “Go home now.”</p>

<p id="p558"><span class="parno">558</span>Turned away at the gate
	<br>of the Saṅgha’s monastery,
	<br>I stood there sadly,
	<br>longing for the dispensation.</p>

<p id="p559"><span class="parno">559</span>Then the Buddha came
	<br>and touched my head.
	<br>Taking me by the arm,
	<br>he brought me into the Saṅgha’s monastery.</p>

<p id="p560"><span class="parno">560</span>The Teacher, out of sympathy,
	<br>gave me a foot-wiping cloth, saying:
	<br>“Focus your awareness
	<br>exclusively on this clean cloth.”</p>

<p id="p561"><span class="parno">561</span>After hearing his words,
	<br>I happily did his bidding.
	<br>I practiced meditative immersion
	<br>for the attainment of the highest goal.</p>

<p id="p562"><span class="parno">562</span>I know my past lives,
	<br>my clairvoyance is clarified;
	<br>I’ve attained the three knowledges,
	<br>and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>

<p id="p563"><span class="parno">563</span>I, Panthaka, created a thousand
	<br>images of myself,
	<br>and sat in the delightful mango grove
	<br>until the time for the meal offering was announced.</p>

<p id="p564"><span class="parno">564</span>Then the teacher sent to me
	<br>a messenger to announce the time.
	<br>When the time was announced,
	<br>I flew to him through the air.</p>

<p id="p565"><span class="parno">565</span>I paid homage at the teacher’s feet,
	<br>and sat to one side.
	<br>When he knew I was seated,
	<br>the teacher received the offering.</p>

<p id="p566"><span class="parno">566</span>Recipient of gifts from the whole world,
	<br>receiver of sacrifices,
	<br>field of merit for humanity,
	<br>he received the religious donation.

	<br>propelled by the mechanism of deeds.
	<br>But existence ends in perishing;
	<br>separated, the body perishes.</p>

<p id="p575"><span class="parno">575</span>Those blind, ordinary people

<p id="p576"><span class="parno">576</span>The undefiled who shun this body
