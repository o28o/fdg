<h5>Adhimutta</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p705"><span class="parno">705</span>“Those who we killed in the past,
	<br>whether for sacrifice or for wealth,
	<br>without exception were afraid;
	<br>they trembled and they squealed.</p>

<p id="p706"><span class="parno">706</span>But you’re not scared;
	<br>you look even calmer than before.
	<br>Why don’t you cry out
	<br>in such a terrifying situation?”</p>

<p id="p707"><span class="parno">707</span>“There isn’t any mental suffering
	<br>for one without hope, village chief.
	<br>All fears are left behind
	<br>by one whose fetters have ended.</p>

<p id="p708"><span class="parno">708</span>When the conduit to rebirth is ended,
	<br>and the truth is seen as it is,
	<br>there is no fear of death;
	<br>it’s like laying down a burden.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p709"><span class="parno">709</span>I’ve lived the spiritual life well,
	<br>and developed the path well, too.
	<br>I do not fear death;
	<br>it’s like the passing of a disease.</p>

<p id="p710"><span class="parno">710</span>I’ve lived the spiritual life well,
	<br>and developed the path well, too.
	<br>I’ve seen that there’s nothing gratifying in existences,
	<br>like someone who has tasted poison, then thrown it out.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p711"><span class="parno">711</span>One who has gone beyond, without grasping,
	<br>they’ve completed the task and are free of defilements.
	<br>They are content at the end of life,
	<br>like someone released from execution.</p>

<p id="p712"><span class="parno">712</span>Having realized the supreme Dhamma,
	<br>without needing anything in the whole world,
	<br>one doesn’t grieve at death;
	<br>for it’s like escaping from a burning house.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p713"><span class="parno">713</span>Whatever has come to pass,
	<br>wherever life is obtained,
	<br>there is no Lord of all that:
	<br>so said the great seer.</p>

<p id="p714"><span class="parno">714</span>Whoever understands this
	<br>as it was taught by the Buddha
	<br>doesn’t grab on to any new life,
	<br>like you wouldn’t grab a hot iron ball.</p>

<p id="p715"><span class="parno">715</span>It doesn’t occur to me, ‘I existed in the past’;
	<br>nor, ‘I will exist in the future’.
	<br>All conditions will disappear—
	<br>why weep over that?</p>

<p id="p716"><span class="parno">716</span>Seeing truly
	<br>the bare arising of phenomena,
	<br>and the bare process of conditions,
	<br>there is no fear, village chief.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p717"><span class="parno">717</span>The world is like grass and sticks:
	<br>when this is seen with wisdom,
	<br>not finding anything to be mine,
	<br>you won’t grieve, thinking ‘I don’t have it’.</p>

<p id="p718"><span class="parno">718</span>I’m fed up with the body;
	<br>I have no need for another life.
	<br>This body will be broken up,
	<br>and there won’t be another.</p>

<p id="p719"><span class="parno">719</span>Do what you want

	<br>I won’t be angry or attached
	<br>on account of that.”</p>

<p id="p720"><span class="parno">720</span>When they heard these words,
	<br>so astonishing and hair-raising,
	<br>the young men laid down their swords
	<br>and spoke these words:</p>

<p id="p721"><span class="parno">721</span>“What have you practiced, Venerable?
	<br>And who is your tutor?
	<br>Whose instructions do we follow
	<br>to gain the sorrowless state?”</p>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p722"><span class="parno">722</span>“The knower of all, the seer of all:
	<br>the victor is my tutor.
	<br>He is a Teacher of great compassion,
	<br>healer of the whole world.</p>

<p id="p723"><span class="parno">723</span>He taught this Dhamma,
	<br>leading to ending, unsurpassed.
	<br>Following his instructions,
	<br>you can gain the sorrowless state.”</p>

<p id="p724"><span class="parno">724</span>When the bandits heard the good words of the seer,
	<br>they laid down their swords and weapons.
	<br>Some refrained from their former deeds,
	<br>while others chose the going-forth.</p>
</div>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p725"><span class="parno">725</span>Having gone forth in the teaching of the Holy One,
	<br>those astute ones developed the awakening factors and the powers.
	<br>Elated, happy, their faculties complete,
	<br>they realized the state of extinguishment, the unconditioned.</p>
</div>

<h5>Pārāsariya (2nd)</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p726"><span class="parno">726</span>This thought came to the ascetic,
	<br>the monk Pārāsariya,
	<br>as he was seated alone
	<br>meditating in seclusion:</p>

<p id="p727"><span class="parno">727</span>“Following what procedure,
	<br>what observance, what conduct,
	<br>may a person what they need to do for themselves,
	<br>without harming anyone else?</p>

<p id="p728"><span class="parno">728</span>The faculties of human beings
	<br>can lead to both welfare and harm.
	<br>Unguarded they lead to harm;
	<br>guarded they lead to welfare.</p>

<p id="p729"><span class="parno">729</span>By protecting the faculties,
	<br>taking care of the faculties,
	<br>I can do what I need to do for myself
	<br>without harming anyone else.</p>

<p id="p730"><span class="parno">730</span>If your eye wanders
	<br>among sights without check,
	<br>not seeing the danger,
	<br>you’re not freed from suffering.</p>

<p id="p731"><span class="parno">731</span>If your ear wanders
	<br>among sounds without check,
	<br>not seeing the danger,
	<br>you’re not freed from suffering.</p>

<p id="p732"><span class="parno">732</span>If, not seeing the escape,
	<br>you indulge in a smell,
	<br>you’re not freed from suffering,
	<br>being besotted by smells.</p>

<p id="p733"><span class="parno">733</span>Recollecting the sour,
	<br>the sweet and the bitter,
	<br>captivated by craving for taste,
	<br>you don’t understand the heart.</p>

<p id="p734"><span class="parno">734</span>Recollecting lovely
	<br>and pleasurable touches,
	<br>full of desire, you experience
	<br>many kinds of suffering because of lust.</p>

<p id="p735"><span class="parno">735</span>Unable to protect
	<br>the mind from such thoughts,
	<br>suffering follows them
	<br>because of all five.</p>

<p id="p736"><span class="parno">736</span>This body is full of pus and blood,
	<br>it’s home to many carcasses;
	<br>but cunning people decorate it
	<br>like a lovely painted casket.</p>

<p id="p737"><span class="parno">737</span>You don’t understand that
	<br>the sweetness of honey turns bitter,
	<br>and the bonds to those we love cause pain,
	<br>like a razor’s edge smeared with honey.</p>

<p id="p738"><span class="parno">738</span>Full of lust for the sight of a woman,
	<br>for the voice and the smells of a woman,
	<br>for a woman’s touch,
	<br>you experience many kinds of suffering.</p>

<p id="p739"><span class="parno">739</span>All of a woman’s streams
	<br>flow from five to five.
	<br>Whoever, being energetic,
	<br>is able to curb these,</p>

<p id="p740"><span class="parno">740</span>purposeful and firm in principle,
	<br>is clever and clear-seeing.
	<br>Though he might enjoy himself,
	<br>his duty is connected with the teaching and its goal.</p>

<p id="p741"><span class="parno">741</span>One who’s diligent and discerning,
	<br>thinking, “This ought not be done”,
	<br>would avoid a useless task
	<br>that’s doomed to failure.</p>

<p id="p742"><span class="parno">742</span>Whatever is meaningful,
	<br>and whatever happiness is principled,
	<br>let one undertake and follow that:
	<br>this is the best happiness.</p>

<p id="p743"><span class="parno">743</span>They want to get hold of what belongs to others
	<br>by any means, fair or foul.
	<br>They kill, injure, and torment,
	<br>violently plundering what belongs to others.</p>

<p id="p744"><span class="parno">744</span>Just as a strong person when building
	<br>knocks out a peg with a peg,
	<br>so the skillful person
	<br>knocks out the faculties with the faculties.</p>

<p id="p745"><span class="parno">745</span>Developing faith, energy, immersion,
	<br>mindfulness, and wisdom;
	<br>destroying the five with the five,
	<br>the brahmin walks on untroubled.</p>

<p id="p746"><span class="parno">746</span>Purposeful and firm in principle,
	<br>having fulfilled in every respect
	<br>the instructions spoken by the Buddha,
	<br>that person prospers in happiness.”</p>
</div>

<h5>Telakāni</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p747"><span class="parno">747</span>For a long time, sadly,
	<br>though I keenly contemplated the teaching,
	<br>I gained no peace of mind.
	<br>So I asked this of ascetics and brahmins:</p>

<p id="p748"><span class="parno">748</span>“Who in the world have crossed over?
	<br>Whose attainment culminates in freedom from death?
	<br>Whose teaching do I accept
	<br>to understand the ultimate goal?</p>

<p id="p749"><span class="parno">749</span>I was hooked inside,
	<br>like a fish gulping bait;
	<br>bound like the titan Vepaciti
	<br>in Mahinda’s trap.</p>

<p id="p750"><span class="parno">750</span>Dragging it along, I’m not free
	<br>from grief and lamentation.
	<br>Who will free me from bonds in the world,
	<br>so that I may know awakening?</p>

<p id="p751"><span class="parno">751</span>What ascetic or brahmin
	<br>points out what is frail?
	<br>Whose teaching do I accept
	<br>to sweep away old age and death?</p>

<p id="p752"><span class="parno">752</span>Tied up with uncertainty and doubt,
	<br>secured by the power of aggression,
	<br>stiff as a mind beset by anger;
	<br>the arrow of covetousness,</p>

<p id="p753"><span class="parno">753</span>propelled by the bow of craving,
	<br>is stuck in my twice-fifteen ribcage—
	<br>see how it stands in my breast,
	<br>breaking my strong heart.</p>

<p id="p754"><span class="parno">754</span>Speculative views are not abandoned,
	<br>they are sharpened by memories and intentions;
	<br>and pierced by this I tremble,
	<br>like a leaf blowing in the wind.</p>

<p id="p755"><span class="parno">755</span>Having arisen within,
	<br>what belongs to me burns quickly,
	<br>in that place where the body always heads
	<br>with its six sense-fields of contact.</p>

<p id="p756"><span class="parno">756</span>I don’t see a healer
	<br>who can pull out my dart of doubt
	<br>without a lance
	<br>or some other blade.</p>

<p id="p757"><span class="parno">757</span>Without knife or wound,
	<br>who will pull out this dart
	<br>that’s stuck inside me,
	<br>without harming any part of my body?</p>

<p id="p758"><span class="parno">758</span>He really would be the Lord of the Dhamma,
	<br>the best one to cure the damage of poison;
	<br>when I have fallen into deep waters,
	<br>he would show me his hand and the shore.</p>

<p id="p759"><span class="parno">759</span>I’ve plunged into a lake,
	<br>and I can’t wash off the mud and dirt.
	<br>It’s full of fraud, jealousy, aggression,
	<br>and dullness and drowsiness.</p>

<p id="p760"><span class="parno">760</span>Like a thunder-cloud of restlessness,
	<br>like a rain cloud of fetters;
	<br>lustful thoughts are winds
	<br>that sweep off a person with bad views.</p>

<p id="p761"><span class="parno">761</span>The streams flow everywhere;
	<br>a weed springs up and remains.
	<br>Who will block the streams?
	<br>Who will cut the weed?”</p>

<p id="p762"><span class="parno">762</span>“Venerable sir, build a dam
	<br>to block the streams.
	<br>Don’t let your mind-made streams
	<br>cut you down suddenly like a tree.”</p>

<p id="p763"><span class="parno">763</span>That is how, when I was full of fear,
	<br>seeking the far shore from the near,
	<br>my shelter was the teacher whose weapon is wisdom,
	<br>surrounded by the Saṅgha of seers.</p>

<p id="p764"><span class="parno">764</span>As I was being swept away,
	<br>he gave me a strong, simple ladder,
	<br>made of the heartwood of Dhamma,
