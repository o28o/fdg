<div class="verse">
<p id="p705"><span class="parno">705</span>"Those that we previously killed,
<br>Whether for sacrifice or for wealth,
<br>Without exception were afraid:
<br>They trembled and squealed.</p>

<p id="p706"><span class="parno">706</span>But you aren’t frightened;
<br>Your appearance is becoming more calm:
<br>Why don’t you cry out
<br>In such a fearful situation?"</p>

<p id="p707"><span class="parno">707</span>"There isn’t any mental suffering
<br>For one without expectations, village chief.
<br>All fears are left behind
<br>By one whose fetters are ended.</p>

<p id="p708"><span class="parno">708</span>When attachment to life is ended,
<br>In this very life as it is,
<br>There is no fear of death,
<br>It is just like laying down a burden.</p>

<p id="p709"><span class="parno">709</span>I’ve lived the spiritual life well,
<br>And developed the path well, too;
<br>I have no fear of death
<br>It is just like the ending of sickness.</p>

<p id="p710"><span class="parno">710</span>I’ve lived the spiritual life well,
<br>And developed the path well, too;
<br>I’ve seen lives seen to be ungratifying,
<br>Like one who has drunk poison, then vomited it out.</p>

<p id="p711"><span class="parno">711</span>One who has gone beyond, without grasping,
<br>Their duty completed, without defilements:
<br>They are content at the end of life,
<br>Just as one freed from execution.</p>

<p id="p712"><span class="parno">712</span>Having realised the supreme Dhamma,
<br>Without needing anything from the whole world,
<br>One doesn’t grieve at death;
<br>It is just like escaping from a burning house.</p>

<p id="p713"><span class="parno">713</span>Whatever has come to pass,
<br>Wherever life is obtained,
<br>There is no-one who can wield power over all that:
<br>So it was said by the great sage.</p>

<p id="p714"><span class="parno">714</span>Whoever understands this
<br>As it was taught by the Buddha
<br>Doesn’t take hold of any kind of life,
<br>It is just like grabbing a hot iron ball.</p>

<p id="p715"><span class="parno">715</span>It doesn’t occur to me, ‘I had past lives’;
<br>Nor does it occur to me, ‘I will have future lives’.
<br>All conditions will disappear — 
<br>Why lament for that?</p>

<p id="p716"><span class="parno">716</span>Seeing in accordance with reality
<br>The bare arising of phenomena,
<br>And the bare continuity of conditions,
<br>There is no fear, village chief.</p>

<p id="p717"><span class="parno">717</span>The world is like grass and wood:
<br>When this is seen with understanding,
<br>Not finding anything to be mine,
<br>Thinking ‘it isn’t mine’, one doesn’t grieve.</p>

<p id="p718"><span class="parno">718</span>I’m fed up with the body;
<br>I don’t need another life.
<br>This body will be broken up,
<br>There won’t be another.</p>

<p id="p719"><span class="parno">719</span>Do what you want
<br>With my corpse.
<br>I won’t be angry or attached
<br>On that account."</p>

<p id="p720"><span class="parno">720</span>When they heard these words,
<br>So astonishing that they gave them goose-bumps,
<br>The young men laid down their swords
<br>And said this:</p>

<p id="p721"><span class="parno">721</span>"What have you practiced, Venerable?
<br>Or who is your teacher?
<br>Whose instructions do we follow
<br>To gain the sorrowless state?"</p>

<p id="p722"><span class="parno">722</span>"All-knowing, all-seeing,
<br>The conqueror is my teacher.
<br>He is a teacher of great compassion,
<br>Healer of the whole world.</p>

<p id="p723"><span class="parno">723</span>He taught this Dhamma,
<br>Which leads to the end, unsurpassed.
<br>Following his instructions,
<br>You can gain the sorrowless state."</p>

<p id="p724"><span class="parno">724</span>When the bandits heard the good words of the sage,
<br>They laid down their swords and weapons.
<br>Some refrained from their deeds,
<br>While others chose the going-forth.</p>

<p id="p725"><span class="parno">725</span>When they had gone forth in the teaching of the Fortunate One,
<br>They developed the factors of awakening and the spiritual powers,
<br>And being wise, with joyful hearts, happy, their spiritual faculties complete,
<br>They realised the state of <i>nibbāna</i>, the unconditioned.</p>

<h5>Pārāpariya</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p726"><span class="parno">726</span>While he was sitting alone
<br>In seclusion, practicing <i>jhāna</i>,
<br>An ascetic, the monk Pārāpariya
<br>Had this thought:</p>

<p id="p727"><span class="parno">727</span>"Following what system
<br>What vow, what conduct,
<br>May I do what I need to do for myself,
<br>Without harming anyone else?</p>

<p id="p728"><span class="parno">728</span>The faculties of human beings
<br>Can lead to both welfare and harm.
<br>Unguarded they lead to harm;
<br>Guarded they lead to welfare.</p>

<p id="p729"><span class="parno">729</span>By protecting the faculties,
<br>Taking care of the faculties,
<br>I can do what I need to do for myself
<br>Without harming anyone else.</p>

<p id="p730"><span class="parno">730</span>If your eye wanders
<br>Among sights without check,
<br>Not seeing the danger,
<br>You’re not freed from suffering.</p>

<p id="p731"><span class="parno">731</span>If your ear wanders
<br>Among sounds without check,
<br>Not seeing the danger,
<br>You’re not freed from suffering.</p>

<p id="p732"><span class="parno">732</span>If, not seeing the escape,
<br>You indulge in smell,
<br>You’re not freed from suffering,
<br>Being infatuated by smells.</p>

<p id="p733"><span class="parno">733</span>Recollecting the sour,
<br>And the sweet and the bitter,
<br>Captivated by craving for taste,
<br>You don’t understand the heart.</p>

<p id="p734"><span class="parno">734</span>Recollecting lovely
<br>And pleasurable touches,
<br>Full of desire, you experience
<br>Many kinds of suffering because of lust.</p>

<p id="p735"><span class="parno">735</span>Unable to protect
<br>The mind from such mental phenomena,
<br>Suffering follows them,
<br>Because of all five.</p>

<p id="p736"><span class="parno">736</span>This body is full of pus and blood,
<br>As well as many carcasses;
<br>But cunning people decorate it
<br>Like a lovely painted casket.</p>

<p id="p737"><span class="parno">737</span>You don’t understand that
<br>The gratification of sweetness turns out bitter,
<br>And attachments to those we love are suffering,
<br>Like a razor smeared all over with honey.</p>

<p id="p738"><span class="parno">738</span>Full of lust for the sight of a woman,
<br>For the voice and the smells of a woman,
<br>For a woman’s touch,
<br>You experience many kinds of suffering.</p>

<p id="p739"><span class="parno">739</span>All of a woman’s streams
<br>Flow from five to five.
<br>Whoever, being energetic,
<br>Is able to curb these,</p>

<p id="p740"><span class="parno">740</span>Purposeful and firm in Dhamma,
<br>Would be clever and discerning;
<br>Even while enjoying himself,
<br>What he does is connected with Dhamma and its purpose.</p>

<p id="p741"><span class="parno">741</span>You should avoid a meaningless task
<br>That is leading to decline.
<br>Thinking, "This is not to be done",
<br>Is being diligent and discerning.</p>

<p id="p742"><span class="parno">742</span>Whatever is meaningful,
<br>A principled happiness,
<br>Let one undertake and practice that:
<br>This is the best happiness.</p>

<p id="p743"><span class="parno">743</span>Coveting the possessions of others
<br>By whatever means, whether high or low,
<br>One kills, injures, and torments,
<br>Violently plundering the possessions of others.</p>

<p id="p744"><span class="parno">744</span>Just as a strong person when building
<br>Knocks out a peg with a peg,
<br>So the skilful person
<br>Knocks out the faculties with the faculties.</p>

<p id="p745"><span class="parno">745</span>Developing faith, energy, <i>samādhi</i>
<br>Mindfulness, and wisdom;
<br>Destroying the five with the five,
<br>The perfected one lives without worry.</p>

<p id="p746"><span class="parno">746</span>Purposeful and firm in Dhamma,
<br>Having fulfilled in every respect
<br>The instructions spoken by the Buddha,
<br>That person prospers in happiness.</p>

<h5>Telakāni</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p747"><span class="parno">747</span>For a long time, unfortunately,
<br>Though I ardently contemplated the Dhamma,
<br>I didn’t have peace of mind;
<br>So I asked ascetics and holy men:</p>

<p id="p748"><span class="parno">748</span>"Who has crossed over the world?
<br>Whose attainment culminates in the deathless?
<br>Whose teaching do I accept,
<br>To understand the highest goal?</p>

<p id="p749"><span class="parno">749</span>I was hooked inside,
<br>Like a fish swallowing bait;
<br>Bound like the demon Vepaciti
<br>In Mahinda’s trap.</p>

<p id="p750"><span class="parno">750</span>Dragging it along, I’m not freed
<br>From grief and lamentation.
<br>Who will free me from bonds in the world,
<br>So that I may know awakening?</p>

<p id="p751"><span class="parno">751</span>What ascetic or holy man
<br>Points to the perishable?
<br>Whose teaching do I accept
<br>To wash away old age and death?</p>

<p id="p752"><span class="parno">752</span>Tied up with uncertainty and doubt,
<br>Secured by the power of pride,
<br>Rigid as a mind overcome by anger;
<br>The arrow of covetousness,</p>

<p id="p753"><span class="parno">753</span>Propelled by the bow of craving,
<br>Is stuck in my twice-fifteen ribs — 
<br>See how it stands in my breast,
<br>Breaking my strong heart.</p>

<p id="p754"><span class="parno">754</span>Speculative views are not abandoned,
<br>They are sharpened by memories and intentions;
<br>And pierced by this I tremble,
<br>Like a leaf blown by wind.</p>

<p id="p755"><span class="parno">755</span>Arising inside me,
<br>My selfishness is quickly tormented,
<br>Where the body always goes
<br>With its six sense-fields of contact.</p>

<p id="p756"><span class="parno">756</span>I don’t see a healer
<br>Who could pull out my dart of doubt,
<br>Without a lance
<br>Or some other blade.</p>

<p id="p757"><span class="parno">757</span>Without knife or wound,
<br>Who will pull out this dart,
<br>That is stuck inside me,
<br>Without harming any part of my body?</p>

<p id="p758"><span class="parno">758</span>He really would be the Lord of the Dhamma,
<br>The best one to cure the damage of poison;
<br>When I had fallen into deep waters,
<br>He would give me his hand and bring me to the shore.</p>

<p id="p759"><span class="parno">759</span>I’ve plunged into a lake,
<br>And I can’t wash off the mud and dirt,
<br>It’s full of fraud, jealousy, pride,
<br>And dullness and drowsiness.</p>

<p id="p760"><span class="parno">760</span>Like a thunder-cloud of restlessness,
<br>Like a rain-cloud of fetters;
<br>Intentions based on lust are winds
<br>That sweep along a person with bad views.</p>

<p id="p761"><span class="parno">761</span>The streams flow everywhere;
<br>A weed springs up and remains;
<br>Who will block the streams?
<br>Who will cut the weed?"</p>

<p id="p762"><span class="parno">762</span>"Venerable sir, build a dam
<br>To block the streams;
<br>Don’t let your mind-made streams
<br>Cut you down suddenly like a tree."</p>

<p id="p763"><span class="parno">763</span>That is how the teacher whose weapon is wisdom,
<br>The sage surrounded by the Saṅgha,
<br>Was my shelter when I was full of fear,
<br>Seeking the far shore from the near.</p>

<p id="p764"><span class="parno">764</span>As I was being swept away,
<br>He gave me a strong, simple ladder,
<br>Made of the heartwood of Dhamma,
<br>And he said to me: "Do not fear."</p>

<p id="p765"><span class="parno">765</span>I climbed the tower of the establishment of mindfulness
<br>And looked back down,
<br>At people delighting in identity,
<br>Which in the past I’d obsessed over.</p>

<p id="p766"><span class="parno">766</span>When I saw the path,
<br>As I was embarking on the ship,
<br>Without fixating on the self,
<br>I saw the supreme landing-place.</p>

<p id="p767"><span class="parno">767</span>The dart that arises in oneself,
<br>And that which is caused by attachment to future lives;
<br>He taught the supreme path
<br>For the stopping of these.</p>

<p id="p768"><span class="parno">768</span>For a long time it had lain within me;
<br>For a long time it was fixed in me:
<br>The Buddha cast off the knot,
<br>Curing the poison’s damage.</p>
</div>
