<h5>Rājadatta</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p315"><span class="parno">315</span>I, a monk, went to a charnel ground
<br>And saw a woman left there,
<br>Discarded in a cemetery,
<br>Full of worms that devoured her.</p>

<p id="p316"><span class="parno">316</span>Some men were disgusted,
<br>Seeing her dead and rotten;
<br>But sexual desire arose in me,
<br>I was as if blind to her oozing body.</p>

<p id="p317"><span class="parno">317</span>Quicker than the boiling of rice
<br>I left that place,
<br>Mindful and aware,
<br>I sat down to one side.</p>

<p id="p318"><span class="parno">318</span>Then the realization
<br>Came upon me — 
<br>The danger became clear,
<br>And I was firmly repulsed.</p>

<p id="p319"><span class="parno">319</span>Then my mind was liberated — 
<br>See the excellence of the Dhamma!
<br>I’ve attained the three knowledges,
<br>And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
</div>
<h5>Subhūta</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p320"><span class="parno">320</span>If a person, wishing for a certain outcome,
<br>Applies themseves to a misguided endeavor,
<br>And they don’t achieve what they have practiced for,
<br>They say: "That’s a sign of my bad luck."</p>

<p id="p321"><span class="parno">321</span>When a misfortune has been plucked out and conquered,
<br>To give it up in part would be like the losing throw of the dice;
<br>But to give up everything would be as if one was blind,
<br>Not discerning the even and the uneven.</p>

<p id="p322"><span class="parno">322</span>You should only say what you would do;
<br>You shouldn’t say what you wouldn’t do.
<br>The wise will recognize
<br>One who talks without doing.</p>

<p id="p323"><span class="parno">323</span>Just like a glorious flower
<br>That’s colourful but lacks fragrance;
<br>So is well-spoken speech fruitless
<br>For one not acting in accordance.</p>

<p id="p324"><span class="parno">324</span>Just like a glorious flower
<br>Is both colourful and fragrant,
<br>So is well-spoken speech fruitful
<br>For one who acts in accordance.</p>
</div>
<h5>Girimānanda</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p325"><span class="parno">325</span>The sky rains, like a beautiful song,
<br>My little hut is roofed and pleasant,
<br>Sheltered from the wind,
<br>I dwell there peacefully
<br>So rain, sky, if you wish.</p>

<p id="p326"><span class="parno">326</span>The sky rains, like a beautiful song,
<br>My little hut is roofed and pleasant,
<br>Sheltered from the wind,
<br>I dwell there, with peaceful mind:
<br>So rain, sky, if you wish.</p>

<p id="p327"><span class="parno">327</span>The sky rains, like a beautiful song,
<br>My little hut is roofed and pleasant,
<br>Sheltered from the wind,
<br>I dwell there, free of lust:
<br>So rain, sky, if you wish.</p>

<p id="p328"><span class="parno">328</span>The sky rains, like a beautiful song,
<br>My little hut is roofed and pleasant,
<br>Sheltered from the wind,
<br>I dwell there, free of hate:
<br>So rain, sky, if you wish.</p>

<p id="p329"><span class="parno">329</span>The sky rains, like a beautiful song,
<br>My little hut is roofed and pleasant,
<br>Sheltered from the wind,
<br>I dwell there, free of delusion:
<br>So rain, sky, if you wish.</p>
</div>
<h5>Sumana</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p330"><span class="parno">330</span>My mentor helped me to learn,
<br>Hoping that I would practice those teachings;
<br>Aspiring for the deathless,
<br>I’ve done what was to be done.</p>

<p id="p331"><span class="parno">331</span>I’ve arrived at the Dhamma,
<br>And witnessed it for myself, not based on hearsay.
<br>With purified knowledge, free of doubt,
<br>I declare it in your presence.</p>

<p id="p332"><span class="parno">332</span>I know my past life;
<br>My divine eye is clarified;
<br>I’ve realized my own true goal,
<br>The Buddha’s instruction is fulfilled.</p>

<p id="p333"><span class="parno">333</span>Being heedful in the training,
<br>I have learned your teachings well.
<br>All my defilements are ended;
<br>Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>

<p id="p334"><span class="parno">334</span>You advised me in noble ways;
<br>Compassionate, you helped teach me;
<br>Your instruction was not in vain — 
<br>I, your student, am fully trained.</p>
</div>
<h5>Vaḍḍha</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p335"><span class="parno">335</span>It was good, how my mother
<br>Spurred me onwards.
<br>When I heard her words,
<br>Advised by my mother,
<br>I became energetic, resolute — 
<br>I realised supreme awakening.</p>

<p id="p336"><span class="parno">336</span>I’m an Arahant, worthy of offerings,
<br>With the three knowledges and the vision of the deathless;
<br>I conquered Namuci’s army,
<br>And now I live without defilements.</p>

<p id="p337"><span class="parno">337</span>The defilements which I had,
<br>Both internally and externally,
<br>Are now all cut off without remainder;
<br>They won’t arise again.</p>

<p id="p338"><span class="parno">338</span>My skilful sister
<br>said this to me:
<br>"Now neither you nor I
<br>Have any entanglements."</p>

<p id="p339"><span class="parno">339</span>Suffering is at an end;
<br>This is the last body
<br>To transmigrate through birth and death:
<br>Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
</div>
<h5>Nadīkassapa</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p340"><span class="parno">340</span>It was truly for my benefit
<br>That the Buddha went to the river Nerañjara;
<br>When I heard his teaching,
<br>I rejected wrong view.</p>

<p id="p341"><span class="parno">341</span>Previously, I performed the higher and lower sacrifices;
<br>I worshipped the sacred flame,
<br>Thinking, "This is purity."
<br>I was a blind, unenlightened person.</p>

<p id="p342"><span class="parno">342</span>Caught in the thicket of wrong view,
<br>Deluded by misapprehension;
<br>Thinking impurity was purity,
<br>I was blind and ignorant.</p>

<p id="p343"><span class="parno">343</span>I’ve abandoned wrong view,
<br>Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,
<br>I worship what is truly worthy of offerings:
<br>I bow to the Tathāgata.</p>

<p id="p344"><span class="parno">344</span>I’ve abandoned all delusion
<br>Rebirth into any state of existence is torn apart,
<br>Transmigration through births is finished,
<br>Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
</div>
<h5>Gayākassapa</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p345"><span class="parno">345</span>Three times a day — 
<br>Morning, midday, and evening — 
<br>I went down into the water at Gayā,
<br>For the Gayā spring festival.</p>

<p id="p346"><span class="parno">346</span>"Whatever bad things I’ve done
<br>In previous births,
<br>I’ll now wash away right here" — 
<br>This is the view I previously held.</p>

<p id="p347"><span class="parno">347</span>Having heard the well-spoken words
<br>Regarding the Dhamma and the goal,
<br>I wisely reflected
<br>On the true, essential goal.</p>

<p id="p348"><span class="parno">348</span>I’ve washed away all bad things
<br>I’m stainless, cleansed, pristine;
<br>The pure heir of the pure one,
<br>A rightful son of the Buddha.</p>

<p id="p349"><span class="parno">349</span>When I plunged into the eight-fold stream,
<br>All bad things were washed away.
<br>I’ve attained the three knowledges,
<br>And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>
</div>
<h5>Vakkali</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p350"><span class="parno">350</span>"Struck by a wind ailment,
<br>While staying in a forest grove;
<br>You’ve gone into a tough place for gathering alms:
<br>How will you get by, monk?"</p>

<p id="p351"><span class="parno">351</span>"Pervading my body
<br>With lots of rapture and happiness,
<br>Putting up with what’s tough,
<br>I’ll dwell in the forest.</p>

<p id="p352"><span class="parno">352</span>Developing the establishments of mindfulness,
<br>The faculties and the powers,
<br>Developing the factors of awakening,
<br>I’ll dwell in the forest.</p>

<p id="p353"><span class="parno">353</span>Having seen those who are energetic, resolute,
<br>Always of strong effort,
<br>Harmonious and serene,
<br>I’ll dwell in the forest.</p>

<p id="p354"><span class="parno">354</span>Recollecting the Buddha
<br>The highest, the tamed, who has <i>samādhi</i>
<br>Not lazy by day or by night
<br>I’ll dwell in the forest."</p>
</div>
<h5>Vijitasena</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p355"><span class="parno">355</span>I’ll cage you, mind,
<br>Like an elephant in a stockade.
<br>Born of the flesh, that net of sensual pleasures,
<br>I won’t urge you to do bad.</p>

<p id="p356"><span class="parno">356</span>Caged, you won’t escape,
<br>Like an elephant who can’t find an open gate.
<br>Demon-mind, you won’t wander again and again,
<br>Bullying, and loving to do bad.</p>

<p id="p357"><span class="parno">357</span>Just as a strong trainer with a hook,
<br>Takes a wild, newly captured elephant
<br>And wins it over against its will,
<br>So I’ll win you over.</p>

<p id="p358"><span class="parno">358</span>Just as a fine charioteer, skilled in the taming
<br>Of fine horses, tames a thoroughbred,
<br>So I’ll tame you,
<br>Firmly established in the five powers.</p>

<p id="p359"><span class="parno">359</span>I’ll bind you with mindfulness,
<br>I’m committed to taming you;
<br>Restrained by harnessed energy,
<br>Mind, you won’t go far from here.</p>
</div>
<h5>Yasadatta</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p360"><span class="parno">360</span>With fault-finding mind, the dullard
<br>Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.
<br>They’re as far from true Dhamma,
<br>As the earth is from the sky.</p>

<p id="p361"><span class="parno">361</span>With fault-finding mind, the dullard
<br>Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.
<br>They decline in the true Dhamma,
<br>Like the moon in the waning fortnight.</p>

<p id="p362"><span class="parno">362</span>With fault-finding mind, the dullard
<br>Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.
<br>They wither away in the true Dhamma,
<br>Like a fish in too little water.</p>

<p id="p363"><span class="parno">363</span>With fault-finding mind, the dullard
<br>Listens to the conqueror’s teaching.
<br>They don’t thrive in the true Dhamma,
<br>Like a rotten seed in a field.</p>

<p id="p364"><span class="parno">364</span>But one with contended mind
<br>Who listens to the conqueror’s teachings — 
<br>Having ended all defilements,
<br>Having witnessed the unshakable,
<br>Having arrived at the highest peace — 
<br>They realize <i>nibbāna</i> without defilements.</p>
</div>
<h5>Soṇakuṭikaṇṇa</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p365"><span class="parno">365</span>I’ve received full ordination,
<br>I am liberated, without defilements,
<br>I’ve seen the Blessed One myself,
<br>And even stayed together with him.</p>

<p id="p366"><span class="parno">366</span>The Blessed One, the teacher,
<br>Spent much of the night in the open;
<br>Then he, who is so skilled at dwelling in meditation,
<br>Entered his dwelling.</p>

<p id="p367"><span class="parno">367</span>Spreading out his outer robe,
<br>Gotama made his bed;
<br>Like a lion in a rocky cave,
<br>With fear and dread abandoned.</p>

<p id="p368"><span class="parno">368</span>Then, with lovely enunciation,
<br>Soṇa, a disciple of the Buddha,
<br>Recited the true Dhamma
<br>In the presence of the best of Buddhas.</p>

<p id="p369"><span class="parno">369</span>When he has fully understood the five aggregates,
<br>Developed the straight path,
<br>And arrived at the highest peace,
<br>He will realize <i>nibbāna</i> without defilements.</p>
</div>
<h5>Kosiya</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p370"><span class="parno">370</span>Whatever wise person, understanding their teacher’s words,
