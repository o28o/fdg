<h5>Ambapālī</h5>

<p id="p252" class="verse"><span class="parno">252</span>
My hair was as black as bees, 
<br>graced with curly tips; 
<br>now old, it has become like hemp bark—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p253" class="verse"><span class="parno">253</span>
Crowned with flowers, 
<br>my head was as fragrant as a perfume box; 
<br>now old, it smells like dog fur—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p254" class="verse"><span class="parno">254</span>
My hair was as thick as a well-planted forest, 
<br>it shone, parted with brush and pins; 
<br>now old, it’s patchy and sparse—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p255" class="verse"><span class="parno">255</span>
With plaits of black and ribbons of gold, 
<br>it was so pretty, adorned with braids; 
<br>now old, my head’s gone bald—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p256" class="verse"><span class="parno">256</span>
My eyebrows used to look so nice, 
<br>like crescents painted by an artist; 
<br>now old, they droop with wrinkles—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p257" class="verse"><span class="parno">257</span>
My eyes shone brilliant as gems, 
<br>wide and deepest blue; 
<br>ruined by age, they shine no more—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>
<p id="p258" class="verse"><span class="parno">258</span>
My nose was like a perfect peak, 
<br>lovely in my bloom of youth; 
<br>now old, it’s shriveled like a pepper; 
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p259" class="verse"><span class="parno">259</span>
My ear-lobes were so pretty, 
<br>like lovingly crafted bracelets; 
<br>now old, they droop with wrinkles—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p260" class="verse"><span class="parno">260</span>
My teeth used to be so pretty, 
<br>bright as a jasmine flower; 
<br>now old, they’re broken and yellow—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p261" class="verse"><span class="parno">261</span>
My singing was sweet as a cuckoo 
<br>wandering in the forest groves; 
<br>now old, it’s patchy and croaking—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p262" class="verse"><span class="parno">262</span>
My neck used to be so pretty, 
<br>like a polished shell of conch; 
<br>now old, it’s bowed and bent—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p263" class="verse"><span class="parno">263</span>
My arms used to be so pretty, 
<br>like rounded cross-bars; 
<br>now old, they droop like a trumpet-flower tree—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p264" class="verse"><span class="parno">264</span>
My hands used to be so pretty, 
<br>adorned with lovely golden rings; 
<br>now old, they’re like red radishes—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p265" class="verse"><span class="parno">265</span>
My breasts used to be so pretty, 
<br>swelling, round, close, and high; 
<br>now they droop like water bags—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p266" class="verse"><span class="parno">266</span>
My body used to be so pretty, 
<br>like a polished slab of gold; 
<br>now it’s covered with fine wrinkles—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p267" class="verse"><span class="parno">267</span>
Both my thighs used to be so pretty, 
<br>like an elephant’s trunk; 
<br>now old, they’re like bamboo—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p268" class="verse"><span class="parno">268</span>
My calves used to be so pretty, 
<br>adorned with cute golden anklets; 
<br>now old, they’re like sesame sticks—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p269" class="verse"><span class="parno">269</span>
Both my feet used to be so pretty, 
<br>plump as if with cotton-wool; 
<br>now old, they’re cracked and wrinkly—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<p id="p270" class="verse"><span class="parno">270</span>
This bag of bones once was such, 
<br>but now it’s withered, home to so much pain; 
<br>like a house in decay with plaster crumbling—
<br>the word of the truthful one is confirmed. </p>

<h5>Rohinī</h5>

<p id="p271" class="verse"><span class="parno">271</span>
“You fell asleep saying ‘ascetics’; 
<br>you woke up saying ‘ascetics’; 
<br>you only praise ascetics, madam—
<br>surely you’ll become an ascetic. </p>
>

<p id="p272" class="verse"><span class="parno">272</span>
You provide ascetics 
<br>with abundant food and drink. 
<br>I ask you now, Rohiṇī: 
<br>why do you like ascetics? </p>

<p id="p273" class="verse"><span class="parno">273</span>
They don’t like to work, they’re lazy, 
<br>they live on charity; 
<br>always on the lookout, greedy for sweets—
<br>so why do you like ascetics?” </p>

<p id="p274" class="verse"><span class="parno">274</span>
“Dad, for a long time now 
<br>you’ve questioned me about ascetics. 
<br>I shall extol for you 
<br>their wisdom, ethics, and vigor. </p>

<p id="p275" class="verse"><span class="parno">275</span>
They like to work, they’re not lazy; 
<br>by giving up greed and hate, 
<br>they do the best kind of work—
<br>that’s why I like ascetics. </p>

<p id="p276" class="verse"><span class="parno">276</span>
As for the three roots of evil, 
<br>by pure deeds they shake them off. 
<br>They have given up all wickedness—
<br>that’s why I like ascetics. </p>

<p id="p277" class="verse"><span class="parno">277</span>
Their bodily actions are pure; 
<br>their actions of speech likewise; 
<br>their actions of mind are pure—
<br>that’s why I like ascetics. </p>

<p id="p278" class="verse"><span class="parno">278</span>
Immaculate as a conch-shell, 
<br>they’re pure inside and out, 
<br>full of bright qualities—
<br>that’s why I like ascetics. </p>

<p id="p279" class="verse"><span class="parno">279</span>
They’re learned and memorize the teaching, 
<br>noble, living righteously, 
<br>teaching the text and its meaning: 
<br>that’s why I like ascetics. </p>


<p id="p280" class="verse"><span class="parno">280</span>
They’re learned and memorize the teaching, 
<br>noble, living righteously, 
<br>unified in mind, and mindful—
<br>that’s why I like ascetics. </p>

<p id="p281" class="verse"><span class="parno">281</span>
Traveling afar, and mindful, 
<br>thoughtful in counsel, and stable, 
<br>they understand the end of suffering—
<br>that’s why I like ascetics. </p>

<p id="p282" class="verse"><span class="parno">282</span>
When they leave a village, 
<br>they don’t look back with longing, 
<br>but proceed without concern—
<br>that’s why I like ascetics. </p>

<p id="p283" class="verse"><span class="parno">283</span>
They hoard no goods in storerooms, 
<br>nor in pots or baskets. 
<br>They seek food prepared by others—
<br>that’s why I like ascetics. </p>

<p id="p284" class="verse"><span class="parno">284</span>
They don’t receive silver, 
<br>or gold whether coined or uncoined; 
<br>feeding on whatever comes that day, 
<br>that’s why I like ascetics. </p>

<p id="p285" class="verse"><span class="parno">285</span>
They have gone forth from different families, 
<br>even different countries, 
<br>and yet they all love one another—
<br>that’s why I like ascetics.” </p>

<p id="p286" class="verse"><span class="parno">286</span>
“Dear Rohinī, it was truly for our benefit 
<br>that you were born in our family! 
<br>You have faith and such keen respect 
<br>for the Buddha, his teaching, and the Saṅgha. </p>

<p id="p287" class="verse"><span class="parno">287</span>
For you understand this 
<br>supreme field of merit. 
<br>These ascetics will henceforth 
<br>receive our religious donation, too. </p>

<p id="p288" class="verse"><span class="parno">288</span>
For there we will place our sacrifice, 
<br>and it shall be abundant.” 
<br>“If you fear suffering, 
<br>if you don’t like suffering, </p>

<p id="p289" class="verse"><span class="parno">289</span>
go for refuge to the Buddha, the poised, 
<br>to his teaching and to the Saṅgha. 
<br>Undertake the precepts, 
<br>that will be good for you.” </p>

<p id="p290" class="verse"><span class="parno">290</span>
“I go for refuge to the Buddha, the poised, 
<br>to his teaching and to the Saṅgha. 
<br>I undertake the precepts, 
<br>that will be good for me. </p>

<p id="p291" class="verse"><span class="parno">291</span>
In the past I was related to Brahmā, 
<br>now I genuinely am a brahmin. 
<br>Possessing the three knowledges, I’m a genuine scholar, 
<br>I’m a knowledge master, a bathed initiate.” </p>

<h5>Cāpā</h5>

<p id="p292" class="verse"><span class="parno">292</span>
“Once I carried a hermit’s staff, 
<br>but these days I hunt deer. 
<br>My desires have made me unable to cross 
<br>from the awful marsh to the far shore. </p>

<p id="p293" class="verse"><span class="parno">293</span>
Thinking me so in love with her, 
<br>Cāpā kept our son happy. 
<br>Having cut Cāpā’s bond, 
<br>I’ll go forth once again.” </p>

<p id="p294" class="verse"><span class="parno">294</span>
“Don’t be mad at me, great hero! 
<br>Don’t be mad at me, great sage! 
<br>If you’re mired in anger you can’t stay pure, 
<br>let alone practice austerities.” </p>

<p id="p295" class="verse"><span class="parno">295</span>
“I’m going to leave Nālā! 
<br>For who’d stay here at Nālā! 
<br>With their figures, the women trap 
<br>ascetics who live righteously.” </p>

<p id="p296" class="verse"><span class="parno">296</span>
“Please, Kāḷa, come back to me. 
<br>Enjoy pleasures like you did before. 
<br>I’ll be under your control, 
<br>along with any relatives I have.” </p>

<p id="p297" class="verse"><span class="parno">297</span>
“Cāpā, if even a quarter 
<br>of what you say were true, 
<br>it would be a splendid thing 
<br>for a man in love with you!” </p>

<p id="p298" class="verse"><span class="parno">298</span>
“Kāḷa, I am like a sprouting iris 
<br>flowering on a mountain top, 
<br>like a blossoming pomegranate, 
<br>like a trumpet-flower tree on an isle; </p>

<p id="p299" class="verse"><span class="parno">299</span>
my limbs are anointed with yellow sandalwood, 
<br>and I wear the finest Kāsi cloth: 
<br>when I am so very beautiful, 
<br>how can you abandon me and leave?” </p>

<p id="p300" class="verse"><span class="parno">300</span>
“You’re like a fowler 
<br>who wants to catch a bird; 
<br>but you won’t trap me 
<br>with your captivating form.” </p>


<p id="p301" class="verse"><span class="parno">301</span>
“But this child, my fruit, 
<br>was begotten by you, Kāḷa. 
<br>When I have this child, 
<br>how can you abandon me and leave?” </p>

<p id="p302" class="verse"><span class="parno">302</span>
“The wise give up 
<br>children, family, and wealth. 
<br>Great heroes go forth 
<br>like elephants breaking their bonds.” </p>

<p id="p303" class="verse"><span class="parno">303</span>
“Now, this son of yours: 
<br>I’ll strike him to the ground right here, 
<br>with a stick or with a knife! 
<br>Grieving your son, you will not leave.” </p>

<p id="p304" class="verse"><span class="parno">304</span>
“Even if you feed our son 
<br>to jackals and dogs, 
<br>I’d never return again, you bitch, 
<br>not even for the child’s sake.” </p>

<p id="p305" class="verse"><span class="parno">305</span>
“Well then, sir, tell me, 
<br>where will you go, Kāḷa? 
<br>To what village or town, 
<br>city or capital?” </p>

<p id="p306" class="verse"><span class="parno">306</span>
“Last time we had followers, 
<br>we weren’t ascetics, we just thought we were. 
<br>We wandered from village to village, 
<br>to cities and capitals. </p>

<p id="p307" class="verse"><span class="parno">307</span>
But now the Blessed One, the Buddha, 
<br>on the bank of the Nerañjara River, 
<br>teaches the Dhamma so that living creatures 
<br>may abandon all suffering. 
<br>I shall go to his presence, 
<br>he shall be my Teacher.” </p>

<p id="p308" class="verse"><span class="parno">308</span>
“Now please convey my respects 
<br>to the supreme protector of the world.

“This is the proper thing to do, 
<br>just as you have said to me. 
<br>I’ll convey your respects

Then Kāḷa set out 
<br>for the bank of the Nerañjara River. 
<br>He saw the Awakened One 
<br>teaching the deathless state: </p>

<p id="p311" class="verse"><span class="parno">311</span>
suffering, suffering’s origin,

<p id="p312" class="verse"><span class="parno">312</span>
He paid homage at his feet, 
<br>circling him to his right,

<br>then he went forth to homelessness. 
<br>He attained the three knowledges,

“Before, when your children passed away,

<p id="p314" class="verse"><span class="parno">314</span>
Today, brahmin lady, you have exposed

<p id="p315" class="verse"><span class="parno">315</span>
“Many hundreds of children,

“Brahmin, the Awakened One

After hearing the perfected one’s teaching,

W

<p id="p320" class="verse"><span class="parno">320</span>
“I too shall go

<br>Hopefully the Buddha may release me

<p id="p321" class="verse"><span class="parno">321</span>
The brahmin saw the Buddha, 
<br>liberated, free of attachments. 
<br>He taught him the Dhamma, 
<br>the sage gone beyond suffering: </p>

<p id="p322" class="verse"><span class="parno">322</span>
suffering, suffering’s origin,

<p id="p323" class="verse"><span class="parno">323</span>
Having understood the true teaching there, 
<br>he chose to go forth. 
<br>Three days later 
<br>Sujāta realized the three knowledges. </p>

<p id="p324" class="verse"><span class="parno">324</span>
“Please, charioteer, go;

<p id="p325" class="verse"><span class="parno">325</span>
Then taking the carriage,

<br>After three days,

<p id="p326" class="verse"><span class="parno">326</span>
Hearing that the brahmin had the three knowledges, the lady replied:

<p id="p327" class="verse"><span class="parno">327</span>
“Keep the horse and carriage, lady,

<h5>Subhā, the Smith’s Daughter</h5>

<p id="p339" class="verse"><span class="parno">339</span>
“I was so young, my clothes so fresh, 
<br>at that time I heard the teaching. 
<br>Being diligent, 
<br>I comprehended the truth; </p>

<p id="p340" class="verse"><span class="parno">340</span>
and then I became profoundly dispassionate 
<br>towards all sensual pleasures. 
<br>Seeing fear in identity, 
<br>I longed for renunciation. </p>

<p id="p341" class="verse"><span class="parno">341</span>
Giving up my family circle,

<br>so delightful and pleasant, </p>

<p id="p342" class="verse"><span class="parno">342</span>
I went forth; 
<br>all that is no small wealth. 
<br>Now that I’ve gone forth in faith like this, 
<br>in the true teaching so well proclaimed, </p>

<p id="p343" class="verse"><span class="parno">343</span>
since I desire to have nothing, 
<br>it would not be appropriate 
<br>to take back gold and money, 
<br>having already got rid of them. </p>

<p id="p344" class="verse"><span class="parno">344</span>
Money or gold 
<br>doesn’t lead to peace and awakening. 
<br>It doesn’t befit an ascetic, 
<br>it’s not the wealth of the noble ones; </p>

<p id="p345" class="verse"><span class="parno">345</span>
it’s just greed and vanity, 
<br>confusion and growing decadence, 
<br>dubious, troublesome—
<br>there is nothing lasting there. </p>

<p id="p346" class="verse"><span class="parno">346</span>
Depraved and heedless, 
<br>unenlightened folk, their hearts corrupt, 
<br>fight each other, 
<br>creating conflict. </p>

<p id="p347" class="verse"><span class="parno">347</span>
Killing, caging, misery,

<br>those sunk in sensual pleasures 
<br>see many disastrous things. </p>

<p id="p348" class="verse"><span class="parno">348</span>
My family, why do you urge me on

<br>You know I’ve gone forth, 
<br>seeing fear in sensual pleasures. </p>

<p id="p349" class="verse"><span class="parno">349</span>
It’s not due to gold, coined or uncoined, 
<br>that defilements come to an end. 
<br>Sensual pleasures are enemies and murderers, 
<br>hostile forces that bind you to thorns. </p>

<p id="p350" class="verse"><span class="parno">350</span>
My family, why do you urge me on 
<br>to pleasures, as if you were my enemies? 
<br>You know I’ve gone forth, 
<br>shaven, wrapped in my outer robe. </p>

<p id="p351" class="verse"><span class="parno">351</span>
Leftovers as gleanings, 
<br>and cast-off rags as robes—
<br>that’s what’s fitting for me, 
<br>the essentials of the homeless life. </p>

<p id="p352" class="verse"><span class="parno">352</span>
Great hermits expel sensual pleasures, 
<br>both human and divine. 
<br>Safe in their sanctuary, they are freed, 
<br>having found unshakable happiness. </p>

<p id="p353" class="verse"><span class="parno">353</span>
May I not encounter sensual pleasures, 
<br>for no shelter is found in them. 
<br>Sensual pleasures are enemies and murderers, 
<br>as painful as a bonfire. </p>

<p id="p354" class="verse"><span class="parno">354</span>
Greed is an obstacle, a threat, 
<br>full of anguish and thorns; 
<br>it is out of balance, 
<br>a great gateway to confusion. </p>

<p id="p355" class="verse"><span class="parno">355</span>
Hazardous and terrifying, 
<br>sensual pleasures are like a snake’s head, 
<br>where fools delight, 
<br>the blind ordinary folk. </p>

<p id="p356" class="verse"><span class="parno">356</span>
Stuck in the swamp of sensuality, 
<br>there are so many ignorant in the world. 
<br>They know nothing of the end 
<br>of rebirth and death. </p>

<p id="p357" class="verse"><span class="parno">357</span>
Because of sensual pleasures, 
<br>people jump right on to the path that goes to a bad place. 
<br>So many walk the path 
<br>that brings disease onto themselves. </p>

<p id="p358" class="verse"><span class="parno">358</span>
That’s how sensual pleasures create enemies; 
<br>they are so tormenting, so corrupting, 
<br>trapping beings with the world’s material delights, 
<br>they are nothing less than the bonds of death. </p>
<br>
<p id="p359" class="verse"><span class="parno">359</span>
Maddening, enticing, 
<br>sensual pleasures derange the mind. 
<br>They’re a snare laid by Māra 
<br>for the corruption of beings. </p>


<br>
<p id="p360" class="verse"><span class="parno">360</span>
Sensual pleasures are infinitely dangerous, 
<br>they’re full of suffering, a terrible poison; 
<br>offering little gratification, they’re makers of strife, 
<br>withering bright qualities away. </p>

<p id="p361" class="verse"><span class="parno">361</span>
Since I’ve created so much ruination 
<br>because of sensual pleasures, 
<br>I will not relapse to them again, 
<br>but will always delight in quenching. </p>

<p id="p362" class="verse"><span class="parno">362</span>
Fighting against sensual pleasures, 
<br>longing for that cool state, 
<br>I shall meditate diligently 
<br>for the ending of all fetters. </p>

<p id="p363" class="verse"><span class="parno">363</span>
Sorrowless, stainless, secure:
<br>I’ll follow that path,
<br>the straight noble eightfold way
<br>by which the hermits have crossed over.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p364" class="verse"><span class="parno">364</span>
“Look at this: Subhā the smith’s daughter, 
<br>standing firm in the teaching. 
<br>She has entered the imperturbable state, 
<br>meditating at the root of a tree. </p>

<p id="p365" class="verse"><span class="parno">364</span>
It’s just eight days since she went forth, 
<br>full of faith in the beautiful teaching. 
<br>Guided by Uppalavaṇṇā, 
<br>she is master of the three knowledges, conqueror of death. </p>

<p id="p366" class="verse"><span class="parno">365</span>
This one is freed from slavery and debt, 
<br>a nun with faculties developed. 
<br>Detached from all attachments, 
<br>she has completed the task and is free of defilements.” </p>

<p id="p367" class="verse"><span class="parno">367</span>Thus did Sakka, lord of all creatures,
