<h5>Isidāsī</h5>

<p id="p402" class="verse"><span class="parno">402</span>
In Pāṭaliputta, the cream of the world, 
<br>the city named for a flower, 
<br>there were two nuns from the Sakyan clan, 
<br>both of them ladies of quality. </p>

<p id="p403" class="verse"><span class="parno">403</span>
One was named Isidāsī, the second Bodhī. 
<br>They both were accomplished in ethics, 
<br>lovers of meditation and chanting, 
<br>learned, crushing corruptions. </p>

<p id="p404" class="verse"><span class="parno">404</span>
They wandered for alms and had their meal. 
<br>When they had washed their bowls, 
<br>they sat happily in a private place 
<br>and started a conversation. </p>

<p id="p405" class="verse"><span class="parno">405</span>
“You’re so lovely, Venerable Isidāsī, 
<br>your youth has not yet faded. 
<br>What problem did you see that made you 
<br>dedicate your life to renunciation?” </p>

<p id="p406" class="verse"><span class="parno">406</span>
Being pressed like this in private, 
<br>Isidāsī, skilled in teaching Dhamma, 
<br>voiced the following words. 
<br>“Bodhī, hear how I went forth. </p>

<p id="p407" class="verse"><span class="parno">407</span>
In the fine town of Ujjenī, 
<br>my father was a financier, a good and moral man. 
<br>I was his only daughter, 
<br>dear, beloved, and cherished. </p>

<p id="p408" class="verse"><span class="parno">408</span>
Then some suitors came for me 
<br>from the top family of Sāketa. 
<br>They were sent by a financier abounding in wealth, 
<br>to whom my father then gave me as daughter-in-law. </p>

<p id="p409" class="verse"><span class="parno">409</span>
Come morning and come night, 
<br>I bowed with my head to the feet 
<br>of my father and mother-in-law, 
<br>just as I had been told. </p>

<p id="p410" class="verse"><span class="parno">410</span>
Whenever I saw my husband’s sisters, 
<br>his brothers, his servants, 
<br>or even he, my one and only, 
<br>I nervously gave them a seat. </p>

<p id="p411" class="verse"><span class="parno">411</span>
Whatever they wanted—food and drink, 
<br>treats, or whatever was in the cupboard—
<br>I brought out and offered to them, 
<br>ensuring each got what was fitting. </p>

<p id="p412" class="verse"><span class="parno">412</span>
Having risen bright and early, 
<br>I approached the main house, 
<br>washed my hands and feet, 
<br>and went to my husband with joined palms. </p>

<p id="p413" class="verse"><span class="parno">413</span>
Taking a comb, adornments, 
<br>eyeshadow, and a mirror, 
<br>I myself did the makeup for my husband, 
<br>as if I were his beautician. </p>

<p id="p414" class="verse"><span class="parno">414</span>

I myself cooked the rice; 
<br>I myself washed the pots. 
<br>I looked after my husband 
<br>like a mother her only child. </p>

<p id="p415" class="verse"><span class="parno">415</span>
Thus I showed my devotion to him, 
<br>a loving, virtuous, and humble servant, 
<br>getting up early, and working tirelessly: 
<br>yet still my husband did me wrong. </p>

<p id="p416" class="verse"><span class="parno">416</span>He said to his mother and father: 
<br>‘I’ll take my leave and go, 
<br>I can’t stand to live together with Isidāsī 
<br>staying in the same house.’ </p>

<p id="p417" class="verse"><span class="parno">417</span>
‘Son, don’t speak like this! 
<br>Isidāsī is astute and competent, 
<br>she gets up early and works tirelessly, 
<br>son, why doesn’t she please you?’ </p>

<p id="p418" class="verse"><span class="parno">418</span>
‘She hasn’t done anything to hurt me, 
<br>but I just can’t stand to live with her. 
<br>As far as I’m concerned, she’s just horrible. 
<br>I’ve had enough, I’ll take my leave and go.’ </p>

<p id="p419" class="verse"><span class="parno">419</span>
When they heard his words, 
<br>my father-in-law and mother-in-law asked me: 
<br>‘What did you do wrong? 
<br>Tell us honestly, have no fear.’ </p>

<p id="p420" class="verse"><span class="parno">420</span>
‘I’ve done nothing wrong, 
<br>I haven’t hurt him, or said anything bad. 
<br>What can I possibly do, 
<br>when my husband finds me so hateful?’ </p>

<p id="p421" class="verse"><span class="parno">421</span>
They led me back to my father’s home, 
<br>distraught, overcome with suffering, and said: 
<br>‘By caring for our son, 
<br>we’ve lost her, so lovely and lucky!’ </p>

<p id="p422" class="verse"><span class="parno">422</span>
Next my dad gave me to the household 
<br>of a second wealthy family-man. 
<br>For this he got half the bride-price 
<br>of that which the financier paid. </p>

<p id="p423" class="verse"><span class="parno">423</span>
In his house I also lived a month, 
<br>before he too wanted me gone; 
<br>though I served him like a slave, 
<br>virtuous and doing no wrong. </p>

<p id="p424" class="verse"><span class="parno">424</span>
My father then spoke to a beggar for alms, 
<br>a tamer of others and of himself: 
<br>‘Be my son-in-law; 
<br>set aside your rags and bowl.’ </p>

<p id="p425" class="verse"><span class="parno">425</span>
He stayed a fortnight before he said to my dad: 
<br>‘Give me back my rag robes, 
<br>my bowl, and my cup—
<br>I’ll wander begging for alms again.’ </p>

<p id="p426" class="verse"><span class="parno">426</span>
So then my mum and my dad 
<br>and my whole group of relatives said: 
<br>‘What has not been done for you here? 
<br>Quickly, tell us what we can do for you!’ </p>

<p id="p427" class="verse"><span class="parno">427</span>
When they spoke to him like this he said, 
<br>‘If I can make do for myself, that is enough. 
<br>I can’t stand to live together with Isidāsī 
<br>staying in the same house.’ </p>

<p id="p428" class="verse"><span class="parno">428</span>
Released, he left. 
<br>But I sat all alone contemplating: 
<br>‘Having taken my leave, I’ll go, 
<br>either to die or to go forth.’ </p>

<p id="p429" class="verse"><span class="parno">429</span>
But then the venerable lady Jinadattā, 
<br>learned and virtuous, 
<br>who had memorized the monastic law, 
<br>came to my dad’s house in search of alms. </p>N

<p id="p430" class="verse"><span class="parno">430</span>
When I saw her, 
<br>I got up from my seat and prepared it for her. 
<br>When she had taken her seat, 
<br>I honored her feet and offered her a meal, </p>

<p id="p431" class="verse"><span class="parno">431</span>
satisfying her with food and drink, 
<br>treats, or whatever was in the cupboard. 
<br>Then I said: 
<br>‘Ma’am, I wish to go forth!’ </p>

<p id="p432" class="verse"><span class="parno">432</span>
But my dad said to me: 
<br>‘Child, practice Dhamma right here! 
<br>Satisfy ascetics and twice-born brahmins 
<br>with food and drink.’ </p>

<p id="p433" class="verse"><span class="parno">433</span>
Then I said to my dad, 
<br>crying, my joined palms raised to him: 
<br>‘I’ve done bad things in the past; 
<br>I shall wear that bad deed away.’ </p>

<p id="p434" class="verse"><span class="parno">434</span>
And my dad said to me: 
<br>‘May you attain awakening, the highest state, 
<br>and may you find the extinguishment 
<br>that was realized by the best of men!’ </p>

<p id="p435" class="verse"><span class="parno">435</span>
I bowed down to my mother and father, 
<br>and my whole group of relatives; 
<br>and then, seven days after going forth, 
<br>I realized the three knowledges. </p>

<p id="p436" class="verse"><span class="parno">436</span>
I know my last seven lives; 
<br>I shall relate to you the deeds 
<br>of which this life is the fruit and result: 
<br>focus your whole mind on that. </p>

<p id="p437" class="verse"><span class="parno">437</span>
In the city of Erakacca 
<br>I was a goldsmith with lots of money. 
<br>Drunk on the pride of youth, 
<br>I had sex with someone else’s wife. </p>

<p id="p438" class="verse"><span class="parno">438</span>
Having passed away from there, 
<br>I burned in hell for a long time. 
<br>Rising up from there 
<br>I was conceived in a monkey’s womb. </p>

<p id="p439" class="verse"><span class="parno">439</span>
When I was only seven days old, 
<br>I was castrated by the monkey chief. 
<br>This was the fruit of that deed, 
<br>because of adultery with another’s wife. </p>

<p id="p440" class="verse"><span class="parno">440</span>
Having passed away from there, 
<br>passing away in Sindhava grove, 
<br>I was conceived in the womb 
<br>of a lame, one-eyed she-goat. </p>

<p id="p441" class="verse"><span class="parno">441</span>
I carried children on my back for twelve years, 
<br>and all the while I was castrated, 
<br>worm-eaten, and tail-less, 
<br>because of adultery with another’s wife. </p>

<p id="p442" class="verse"><span class="parno">442</span>
Having passed away from there, 
<br>I was reborn in a cow 
<br>owned by a cattle merchant. 
<br>A red calf, castrated, for twelve months </p>

<p id="p443" class="verse"><span class="parno">443</span>
I drew a big plow. 
<br>I shouldered a cart, 
<br>blind, tail-less, feeble, 
<br>because of adultery with another’s wife. </p>

<p id="p444" class="verse"><span class="parno">444</span>
Having passed away from there, 
<br>I was born of a slave in the street, 
<br>with neither male nor female parts, 
<br>because of adultery with another’s wife. </p>

<p id="p445" class="verse"><span class="parno">445</span>
I died at thirty years of age, 
<br>and was reborn as a girl in a carter’s family. 
<br>We were poor, of little wealth, 
<br>greatly oppressed by creditors. </p>

<p id="p446" class="verse"><span class="parno">446</span>
Because of the huge interest we owed, 
<br>I was dragged away screaming, 
<br>taken by force from the family home 
<br>by a caravan leader. </p>

<p id="p447" class="verse"><span class="parno">447</span>
When I was sixteen years old, 
<br>his son named Giridāsa, 
<br>seeing that I was a girl of marriageable age, 
<br>took me as his wife. </p>

<p id="p448" class="verse"><span class="parno">448</span>
He also had another wife, 
<br>a virtuous and well-known lady of quality, 
<br>faithful to her husband; 
<br>yet I stirred up resentment in her. </p>

<p id="p449" class="verse"><span class="parno">449</span>
As the fruit of that deed, 
<br>they abandoned me and left, 
<br>though I served them like a slave. 
<br>Now I’ve made an end to this as well.” </p>
