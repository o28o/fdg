<h5>Sumedhā</h5>

<p id="p450" class="verse"><span class="parno">450</span>
In Mantāvatī city, Sumedhā, 
<br>the daughter of King Koñca’s chief queen, 
<br>was converted by those 
<br>who practice the Buddha’s teaching. </p>

<p id="p451" class="verse"><span class="parno">451</span>
She was virtuous, a brilliant speaker, 
<br>learned, and trained in the Buddha’s instructions. 
<br>She went up to her mother and father and said: 
<br>“Pay heed, both of you! </p>

<p id="p452" class="verse"><span class="parno">452</span>
I delight in extinguishment! 
<br>No life is eternal, not even that of the gods; 
<br>what then of sensual pleasures, so hollow, 
<br>offering little gratification and much anguish. </p>

<p id="p453" class="verse"><span class="parno">453</span>
Sensual pleasures are bitter as the venom of a snake, 
<br>yet fools are infatuated by them. 
<br>Sent to hell for a very long time, 
<br>they are beaten and tortured. </p>

<p id="p454" class="verse"><span class="parno">454</span>
Those who grow in wickedness 
<br>always sorrow in the underworld due to their own bad deeds. 
<br>They’re fools, unrestrained in body, 
<br>mind, and speech. </p>

<p id="p455" class="verse"><span class="parno">455</span>
Those witless, senseless fools, 
<br>obstructed by the origin of suffering, 
<br>are ignorant, not understanding the noble truths 
<br>when they are being taught. </p>

<p id="p456" class="verse"><span class="parno">456</span>
Most people, mum, ignorant of the truths 
<br>taught by the excellent Buddha, 
<br>look forward to the next life, 
<br>longing for rebirth among the gods. </p>

<p id="p457" class="verse"><span class="parno">457</span>
Yet even rebirth among the gods 
<br>in an impermanent state is not eternal. 
<br>But fools are not scared 
<br>of being reborn time and again. </p>

<p id="p458" class="verse"><span class="parno">458</span>
Four lower realms and two other realms 
<br>may be gained somehow or other. 
<br>But for those who end up in a lower realm, 
<br>there is no way to go forth in the hells. </p>

<p id="p459" class="verse"><span class="parno">459</span>
May you both grant me permission to go forth 
<br>in the dispensation of him of the ten powers. 
<br>Living at ease, I shall apply myself 
<br>to giving up rebirth and death. </p>

<p id="p460" class="verse"><span class="parno">460</span>
What’s the point in hope, in a new life, 
<br>in this useless, hollow body? 
<br>Grant me permission, I shall go forth 
<br>to make an end of craving for a new life. </p>

<p id="p461" class="verse"><span class="parno">461</span>
A Buddha has arisen, the time has come, 
<br>the unlucky moment has passed. 
<br>As long as I live I’ll never betray 
<br>my ethical precepts or my celibate path.” </p>

<p id="p462" class="verse"><span class="parno">462</span>
Then Sumedhā said to her parents: 
<br>“So long as I remain a lay person, 
<br>I’ll refuse to eat any food, 
<br>until I’ve fallen under the sway of death.” </p>

<p id="p463" class="verse"><span class="parno">463</span>
Upset, her mother burst into tears, 
<br>while her father, though grieved, 
<br>tried his best to persuade her 
<br>as she lay collapsed on the longhouse roof. </p>

<p id="p464" class="verse"><span class="parno">464</span>
“Get up child, why do you grieve so? 
<br>You’re already betrothed to be married! 
<br>King Anīkaratta the handsome 
<br>is in Vāraṇavatī: he is your betrothed. </p>

<p id="p465" class="verse"><span class="parno">465</span>
You shall be the chief queen, 
<br>wife of King Anīkaratta. 
<br>Ethical precepts, the celibate path—
<br>going forth is hard to do, my child. </p>

<p id="p466" class="verse"><span class="parno">466</span>
As a royal there is command, wealth, authority, 
<br>and the happiness of possessions. 
<br>Enjoy sensual pleasures while you’re still young! 
<br>Let your wedding take place, my child!” </p>

<p id="p467" class="verse"><span class="parno">467</span>
Then Sumedhā said to him: 
<br>“Let this not come to pass! Existence is hollow! 
<br>I shall either go forth or die, 
<br>but I shall never marry. </p>

<p id="p468" class="verse"><span class="parno">468</span>
Why cling to this rotting body so foul, 
<br>stinking of fluids, 
<br>a horrifying water-bag of corpses, 
<br>always oozing, full of filth? </p>

<p id="p469" class="verse"><span class="parno">469</span>
Knowing it like I do, what’s the point? 
<br>A carcass is vile, smeared with flesh and blood, 
<br>food for birds and swarms of worms—
<br>why have we been given it? </p>

<p id="p470" class="verse"><span class="parno">470</span>
Before long the body, bereft of consciousness, 
<br>is carried out to the charnel ground, 
<br>to be tossed aside like an old log 
<br>by relatives in disgust. </p>

<p id="p471" class="verse"><span class="parno">471</span>
When they’ve tossed it away in the charnel ground, 
<br>to be eaten by others, your own parents 
<br>bathe themselves, disgusted; 
<br>what then of people at large? </p>

<p id="p472" class="verse"><span class="parno">472</span>
They’re attached to this hollow carcass, 
<br>this mass of sinews and bone; 
<br>this rotting body 
<br>full of saliva, tears, feces, and pus. </p>

<p id="p473" class="verse"><span class="parno">473</span>
If anyone were to dissect it, 
<br>turning it inside out, 
<br>the unbearable stench 
<br>would disgust even their own mother. </p>

<p id="p474" class="verse"><span class="parno">474</span>
Properly examining 
<br>the aggregates, elements, and sense fields 
<br>as conditioned, rooted in birth, suffering—
<br>why would I wish for marriage? </p>

<p id="p475" class="verse"><span class="parno">475</span>
Let three hundred sharp swords 
<br>fall on my body everyday! 
<br>Even if the slaughter lasted 100 years 
<br>it’d be worth it if it led to the end of suffering. </p>

<p id="p476" class="verse"><span class="parno">476</span>
One who understands the Teacher’s words 
<br>would put up with this slaughter: 
<br>‘Long for you is transmigration 
<br>being killed time and time again.’ </p>

<p id="p477" class="verse"><span class="parno">477</span>
Among gods and humans, 
<br>in the realm of animals or that of demons, 
<br>among the ghosts or in the hells, 
<br>endless killings are seen. </p>

<hr>
<p id="p478" class="verse"><span class="parno">478</span>
The hells are full of killing, 
<br>for the corrupt who have fallen to the underworld. 
<br>Even among the gods there is no shelter, 
<br>for no happiness excels extinguishment. </p>

<p id="p479" class="verse"><span class="parno">479</span>
Those who are committed to the dispensation 
<br>of him of the ten powers attain extinguishment. 
<br>Living at ease, they apply themselves 
<br>to giving up rebirth and death. </p>

<p id="p480" class="verse"><span class="parno">480</span>
On this very day, dad, I shall renounce: 
<br>what’s to enjoy in hollow riches? 
<br>I’m disillusioned with sensual pleasures, 
<br>they’re like vomit, made like a palm stump.” </p>

<p id="p481" class="verse"><span class="parno">481</span>
As she spoke thus to her father, 
<br>Anīkaratta, to whom she was betrothed, 
<br>approached from Vāraṇavatī 
<br>at the time appointed for the marriage. </p>

<p id="p482" class="verse"><span class="parno">482</span>
Then Sumedhā took up a knife, 
<br>and cut off her hair, so black, thick, and soft. 
<br>Shutting herself in the longhouse, 
<br>she entered the first absorption. </p>

<p id="p483" class="verse"><span class="parno">483</span>
And as she entered it there, 
<br>Anīkaratta arrived at the city. 
<br>Then in the longhouse, Sumedhā 
<br>well developed the perception of impermanence. </p>

<p id="p484" class="verse"><span class="parno">484</span>
As she investigated in meditation, 
<br>Anīkaratta quickly climbed the stairs. 
<br>His limbs adorned with gems and gold, 
<br>he begged Sumedhā with joined palms: </p>

<p id="p485" class="verse"><span class="parno">485</span>
“As a royal there is command, wealth, authority, 
<br>and the happiness of possessions. 
<br>Enjoy sensual pleasures while you’re still young! 
<br>Sensual pleasures are hard to find in the world! </p>

<p id="p486" class="verse"><span class="parno">486</span>
I’ve handed royalty to you—
<br>enjoy riches, give gifts! 
<br>Don’t be sad; 
<br>your parents are upset.” </p>

<p id="p487" class="verse"><span class="parno">487</span>
Sumedhā, having no use for sensual pleasures, 
<br>and having done away with delusion, spoke right back: 
<br>“Do not take pleasure in sensuality! 
<br>See the danger in sensual pleasures! </p>

<p id="p488" class="verse"><span class="parno">488</span>
Mandhātā, king of four continents, 
<br>foremost in enjoying sensual pleasures, 
<br>died unsated, 
<br>his desires unfulfilled. </p>

<p id="p489" class="verse"><span class="parno">489</span>
Were the seven jewels to rain from the sky 
<br>all over the ten directions, 
<br>there would be no sating of sensual pleasures: 
<br>people die insatiable. </p>

<p id="p490" class="verse"><span class="parno">490</span>
Like a butcher’s knife and chopping block, 
<br>sensual pleasures are like a snake’s head. 
<br>They burn like a fire-brand, 
<br>they resemble a skeleton. </p>

<p id="p491" class="verse"><span class="parno">491</span>
Sensual pleasures are impermanent and unstable, 
<br>they’re full of suffering, a terrible poison; 
<br>like a hot iron ball, 
<br>the root of misery, their fruit is pain. </p>

<p id="p492" class="verse"><span class="parno">492</span>
Sensual pleasures are like fruits of a tree, 
<br>like lumps of meat, painful, 
<br>they trick you like a dream; 
<br>sensual pleasures are like borrowed goods. </p>

<p id="p493" class="verse"><span class="parno">493</span>
Sensual pleasures are like swords and stakes; 
<br>a disease, a boil, misery and trouble. 
<br>Like a pit of glowing coals, 
<br>the root of misery, fear and slaughter. </p>

<p id="p494" class="verse"><span class="parno">494</span>
Thus sensual pleasures have been explained 
<br>to be obstructions, so full of suffering. 
<br>Please leave! As for me, 
<br>I have no trust in a new life. </p>

<p id="p495" class="verse"><span class="parno">495</span>
What can someone else do for me 
<br>when their own head is burning? 
<br>When stalked by old age and death, 
<br>you should strive to destroy them.” </p>

<p id="p496" class="verse"><span class="parno">496</span>
She opened the door 
<br>and saw her parents with Anīkaratta, 
<br>sitting crying on the floor. 
<br>And so she said this: </p>

<p id="p497" class="verse"><span class="parno">497</span>
“Transmigration is long for fools, 
<br>crying again and again at that with no known beginning—
<br>the death of a father, 
<br>the killing of a brother or of themselves. </p>

<p id="p498" class="verse"><span class="parno">498</span>
Remember the ocean of tears, of milk, of blood—
<br>transmigration with no known beginning. 
<br>Remember the bones piled up 
<br>by beings transmigrating. </p>

<p id="p499" class="verse"><span class="parno">499</span>
Remember the four oceans 
<br>compared with tears, milk, and blood. 
<br>Remember bones piled up high as Mount Vipula 
<br>in the course of a single eon. </p>

<p id="p500" class="verse"><span class="parno">500</span>
Transmigration with no known beginning 
<br>is compared to this broad land of India; 
<br>if divided into lumps the size of jujube seeds, 
<br>they’d still be fewer than his mother’s mothers. </p>

<p id="p501" class="verse"><span class="parno">501</span>
Remember the grass, sticks, and leaves, 
<br>compare that with no known beginning: 
<br>if split into pieces four inches in size, 
<br>they’d still be fewer than his father’s fathers. </p>

<p id="p502" class="verse"><span class="parno">502</span>
Remember the one-eyed turtle and the yoke with a hole 
<br>blown in the ocean from east to west—
<br>sticking the head in the hole 
<br>is a metaphor for gaining a human birth. </p>

<p id="p503" class="verse"><span class="parno">503</span>
Remember the form of this unlucky body, 
<br>insubstantial as a lump of foam. 
<br>See the aggregates as impermanent, 
<br>remember the hells so full of anguish. </p>

<p id="p504" class="verse"><span class="parno">504</span>
Remember those swelling the charnel grounds 
<br>again and again in life after life. 
<br>Remember the threat of the marsh crocodile! 
<br>Remember the four truths! </p>

<p id="p505" class="verse"><span class="parno">505</span>
When the deathless is there to be found, 
<br>why would you drink the five bitter poisons? 
<br>For every enjoyment of sensual pleasures 
<br>is so much more bitter than them. </p>

<p id="p506" class="verse"><span class="parno">506</span>
When the deathless is there to be found, 
<br>why would you burn for sensual pleasures? 
<br>For every enjoyment of sensual pleasures 
<br>is burning, boiling, bubbling, seething. </p>

<p id="p507" class="verse"><span class="parno">507</span>
When there is freedom from enmity, 
<br>why would you want your enemy, sensual pleasures? 
<br>Like kings, fire, robbers, flood, and people you dislike, 
<br>sensual pleasures are very much your enemy. </p>

<p id="p508" class="verse"><span class="parno">508</span>
When liberation is there to be found, 
<br>what good are sensual pleasures that kill and bind? 
<br>For though unwilling, when sensual pleasures are there, 
<br>they are subject to the pain of killing and binding. </p>

<p id="p509" class="verse"><span class="parno">509</span>
As a blazing grass torch 
<br>burns one who grasps it without letting go, 
<br>sensual pleasures are like a grass torch, 
<br>burning those who do not let go. </p>

<p id="p510" class="verse"><span class="parno">510</span>
Don’t give up abundant happiness 
<br>for the trivial joys of sensual pleasure. 
<br>Don’t fret later, 
<br>like a catfish on a hook. </p>

<p id="p511" class="verse"><span class="parno">511</span>
Deliberately control yourself among sensual pleasures! 
<br>You’re like a dog fixed to a chain: 
<br>sensual pleasures will surely devour you 
<br>as hungry outcasts would a dog. </p>

<p id="p512" class="verse"><span class="parno">512</span>
Harnessed to sensual pleasure, 
<br>you undergo endless pain, 
<br>along with much mental anguish: 
<br>relinquish sensual pleasures, they don’t last! </p>

<p id="p513" class="verse"><span class="parno">513</span>
When the unaging is there to be found, 
<br>what good are sensual pleasures in which is old age? 
<br>All rebirths everywhere 
<br>are bonded to death and sickness. </p>

<p id="p514" class="verse"><span class="parno">514</span>
This is the ageless, this is the deathless! 
<br>This is the ageless and deathless, the sorrowless state! 
<br>Free of enmity, unconstricted, 
<br>faultless, fearless, without tribulations. </p>

<p id="p515" class="verse"><span class="parno">515</span>
This deathless has been realized by many; 
<br>even today it can be obtained 
<br>by those who properly apply themselves; 
<br>but it’s impossible if you don’t try.” </p>

<p id="p516" class="verse"><span class="parno">516</span>
So said Sumedhā, 
<br>lacking delight in conditioned things. 
<br>Soothing Anīkaratta, 
<br>Sumedhā cast her hair on the ground. </p>

<p id="p517" class="verse"><span class="parno">517</span>
Standing up, Anīkaratta 
<br>raised his joined palms to her father and begged: 
<br>“Let go of Sumedhā, so that she may go forth! 
<br>She will see the truth of liberation.” </p>

<p id="p518" class="verse"><span class="parno">518</span>
Released by her mother and father, 
<br>she went forth, afraid of grief and fear. 
<br>While still a trainee nun she realized the six direct knowledges, 
<br>along with the highest fruit. </p>

<p id="p519" class="verse"><span class="parno">519</span>
The extinguishment of the princess 
<br>was incredible and amazing; 
<br>on her deathbed, she declared 
<br>her several past lives. </p>

<p id="p520" class="verse"><span class="parno">520</span>
“In the time of the Buddha Koṇāgamana, 
<br>we three friends gave the gift 
<br>of a newly-built dwelling 
<br>in the Saṅgha’s monastery. </p>

<p id="p521" class="verse"><span class="parno">521</span>
Ten times, a hundred times, 
<br>a thousand times, ten thousand times, 
<br>we were reborn among the gods, 
<br>let alone among humans. </p>

<p id="p522" class="verse"><span class="parno">522</span>
We were mighty among the gods, 
<br>let alone among humans! 
<br>I was queen to a king with the seven treasures—
<br>I was the treasure of a wife. </p>

<p id="p523" class="verse"><span class="parno">523</span>That was the cause, that the origin, that the root, 
<br>that was the acceptance of the dispensation; 
<br>that first meeting culminated in extinguishment 
<br>for one delighting in the teaching. </p>

<p id="p524" class="verse"><span class="parno">524</span>
So say those who have faith in the words 
<br>of the one unrivaled in wisdom. 
<br>They’re disillusioned with being reborn, 
<br>and being disillusioned they become dispassionate.” </p>
