<h5>An Unnamed Nun (2nd)</h5>

<p id="p67" class="verse"><span class="parno">67</span>
In the twenty-five years 
<br>since I went forth 
<br>I have not found peace of mind, 
<br>even for as long as a finger-snap. </p>

<p id="p68" class="verse"><span class="parno">68</span>
Failing to find peace of heart, 
<br>corrupted by sensual desire, 
<br>I cried with flailing arms 
<br>as I entered a dwelling. </p>

<p id="p69" class="verse"><span class="parno">69</span>
I approached a nun 
<br>in whom I had faith. 
<br>She taught me the Dhamma: 
<br>the aggregates, sense fields, and elements. </p>

<p id="p70" class="verse"><span class="parno">70</span>
When I heard her teaching, 
<br>I retired to a discreet place. 
<br>I know my past lives; 
<br>my clairvoyance is purified; </p>

<p id="p71" class="verse"><span class="parno">71</span>
I comprehend the minds of others; 
<br>my clairaudience is purified; 
<br>I've realized the psychic powers, 
<br>and attained the ending of defilements. 
<br>I have realized the six kinds of direct knowledge, 
<br>and fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. </p>
 
<h5>Vimalā, the Former Courtesan</h5>

<p id="p72" class="verse"><span class="parno">72</span>
Intoxicated by my appearance, 
<br>my figure, my beauty, my fame, 
<br>and owing to my youth, 
<br>I despised other women. </p>

<p id="p73" class="verse"><span class="parno">73</span>
I adorned this body, 
<br>so fancy, cooed over by fools, 
<br>and stood at the brothel door, 
<br>like a hunter laying a snare. </p>

<p id="p74" class="verse"><span class="parno">74</span>
I stripped for them, 
<br>revealing my many hidden treasures. 
<br>Creating an intricate illusion, 
<br>I laughed, teasing those men. </p>

<p id="p75" class="verse"><span class="parno">75</span>
Today, having wandered for alms, 
<br>my head shaven, wearing the outer robe, 
<br>I sat at the root of a tree to meditate; 
<br>I've gained freedom from thought. </p>

<p id="p76" class="verse"><span class="parno">76</span>
All bonds are cut off, 
<br>both human and divine. 
<br>Having wiped out all defilements, 
<br>I have become cooled and quenched. </p>

<h5>Sīhā</h5>

<p id="p77" class="verse"><span class="parno">77</span>
Due to improper attention, 
<br>I was racked by desire for pleasures of the senses. 
<br>I was restless in the past, 
<br>lacking control over my mind. </p>

<p id="p78" class="verse"><span class="parno">78</span>
Overcome by corruptions, 
<br>pursuing perceptions of the beautiful, 
<br>I gained no peace of mind. 
<br>Under the sway of lustful thoughts, </p>

<p id="p79" class="verse"><span class="parno">79</span>
thin, pale, and wan, 
<br>for seven years I wandered, 
<br>full of pain, 
<br>finding no happiness by day or night. </p>

<p id="p80" class="verse"><span class="parno">80</span>
Taking a rope 
<br>I entered deep into the forest, thinking: 
<br>“It’s better that I hang myself 
<br>than I return to a lesser life.” </p>

<p id="p81" class="verse"><span class="parno">81</span><a class="pts1" id="pts132"></a>
I made a strong noose 
<br>and tied it to the branch of a tree. 
<br>Casting it round my neck, 
<br>my mind was freed. </p>

<h5>Sundarīnandā</h5>

<p id="p82" class="verse"><span class="parno">82</span>“Nandā, see this bag of bones as 
<br>diseased, filthy, and rotten. 
<br>With mind unified and serene, 
<br>meditate on the ugly aspects of the body: </p>

<p id="p83" class="verse"><span class="parno">83</span>
as this is, so is that, 
<br>as that is, so is this. 
<br>A foul stink wafts from it, 
<br>it is the fools’ delight.” </p>

<p id="p84" class="verse"><span class="parno">84</span>
Reflecting in such a way, 
<br>tireless all day and night, 
<br>having broken through 
<br>with my own wisdom, I saw. </p>

<p id="p85" class="verse"><span class="parno">85</span>
Being diligent, 
<br>properly investigating, 
<br>I truly saw this body 
<br>both inside and out. </p>

<p id="p86" class="verse"><span class="parno">86</span>
Then, growing disillusioned with the body, 
<br>I became dispassionate within. 
<br>Diligent, detached, 
<br>I’m quenched and at peace. </p>

<h5>Nanduttarā</h5>

<p id="p87" class="verse"><span class="parno">87</span>
In the past I worshiped the sacred flame, 
<br>the moon, the sun, and the gods. 
<br>Having gone to a river ford, 
<br>I plunged into the water. </p>

<p id="p88" class="verse"><span class="parno">88</span>
Undertaking many vows, 
<br>I shaved half my head. 
<br>Preparing a bed on the ground, 
<br>I ate no food at night. </p>

<p id="p89" class="verse"><span class="parno">89</span>
I loved my ornaments and decorations; 
<br>and with baths and oil-massages, 
<br>I pandered to this body, 
<br>racked by desire for pleasures of the senses. </p>

<p id="p90" class="verse"><span class="parno">90</span>
But then I gained faith, 
<br>and went forth to homelessness. 
<br>Truly seeing the body, 
<br>desire for sensual pleasure is eradicated. </p>

<p id="p91" class="verse"><span class="parno">91</span>
All rebirths are cut off, 
<br>wishes and aspirations too. 
<br>Detached from all attachments, 
<br>I've found peace of mind. </p>

<h5>Mittākāḷī</h5>

<p id="p92" class="verse"><span class="parno">92</span>
Having gone forth out of faith 
<br>from the lay life to homelessness, 
<br>I wandered here and there, 
<br>jealous of possessions and honors. </p>

<p id="p93" class="verse"><span class="parno">93</span>
Neglecting the highest goal, 
<br>I pursued the lowest. 
<br>Under the sway of corruptions, 
<br>I never knew the goal of the ascetic life. </p>

<p id="p94" class="verse"><span class="parno">94</span>
I was struck with a sense of urgency 
<br>as I was sitting in my hut: 
<br>“I’m walking the wrong path, 
<br>under the sway of craving. </p>

<p id="p95" class="verse"><span class="parno">95</span>
My life is short, 
<br>trampled by old age and sickness. 
<br>Before this body breaks apart, 
<br>there is no time for me to be careless.” </p>

<p id="p96" class="verse"><span class="parno">96</span>
I examined in line with reality 
<br>the rise and fall of the aggregates. 
<br>I stood up with mind liberated, 
<br>having fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions. </p>

<h5>Sakulā</h5>

<p id="p97" class="verse"><span class="parno">97</span>
While staying at home 
<br>I heard the teaching from a monk. 
<br>I saw the stainless Dhamma, 
<br>extinguishment, the imperishable state. </p>

<p id="p98" class="verse"><span class="parno">98</span>
Leaving behind my son and my daughter, 
<br>my riches and my grain, 
<br>I had my hair cut off, 
<br>and went forth to homelessness. </p>

<p id="p99" class="verse"><span class="parno">99</span>
As a trainee nun, 
<br>I developed the direct path. 
<br>I gave up greed and hate, 
<br>along with associated defilements. </p>

<p id="p100" class="verse"><span class="parno">100</span>
When I was fully ordained as a nun, 
<br>I recollected my past lives, 
<br>and purified my clairvoyance, 
<br>immaculate and fully developed. </p>

<p id="p101" class="verse"><span class="parno">101</span>
Conditions are born of causes, crumbling; 
<br>having seen them as other, 
<br>I gave up all defilements, 
<br>I’m cooled and quenched. </p>

<h5>Soṇā</h5>

<p id="p102" class="verse"><span class="parno">102</span>
I gave birth to ten sons 
<br>in this form, this bag of bones. 
<br>Then, when feeble and old, 
<br>I approached a nun. </p>

<p id="p103" class="verse"><span class="parno">103</span>
She taught me the Dhamma: 
<br>the aggregates, sense fields, and elements. 
<br>When I heard her teaching, 
<br>I shaved off my hair and went forth. </p>

<p id="p104" class="verse"><span class="parno">104</span>
When I was a trainee nun, 
<br>my clairvoyance was clarified, 
<br>and I knew my past lives, 
<br>the places I used to live. </p>

<p id="p105" class="verse"><span class="parno">105</span>
I meditate on the signless, 
<br>my mind unified and serene. 
<br>I achieved the immediate liberation, 
<br>extinguished by not grasping. </p>

<p id="p106" class="verse"><span class="parno">106</span>
The five aggregates are fully understood; 
<br>they remain, but their root is cut. 
<br>Curse you, wretched old age! 
<br>now there’ll be no more future lives. </p>

<h5>Bhaddā of the Curly Hair</h5>

<p id="p107" class="verse"><span class="parno">107</span>
My hair mown off, covered in mud, 
<br>I used to wander wearing just one robe. 
<br>I saw fault where there was none, 
<br>and was blind to the actual fault. </p>

<p id="p108" class="verse"><span class="parno">108</span>
Leaving my day’s meditation 
<br>on Vulture’s Peak Mountain, 
<br>I saw the stainless Buddha 
<br>at the fore of the mendicant Saṅgha. </p>


<p id="p109" class="verse"><span class="parno">109</span>
I bent my knee and bowed, 
<br>and in his presence raised my joined palms. 
<br>“Come Bhaddā,” he said; 
<br>that was my ordination. </p>

<p id="p110" class="verse"><span class="parno">110</span>
“I’ve wandered among the Aṅgans and Magadhans, 
<br>the Vajjīs, Kāsīs, and Kosalans. 
<br>I have eaten the almsfood of the nations 
<br>free of debt for fifty years.” </p>

<p id="p111" class="verse"><span class="parno">111</span>
“O! He has made so much merit! 
<br>That lay follower is so very wise. 
<br>He gave a robe to Bhaddā, 
<br>who is released from all ties.” </p>

<h5>Paṭācārā</h5>

<p id="p112" class="verse"><span class="parno">112</span>
Plowing the fields, 
<br>sowing seeds in the ground, 
<br>supporting partners and children, 
<br>young men acquire wealth. </p>

<p id="p113" class="verse"><span class="parno">113</span>
I am accomplished in ethics, 
<br>and I do the Teacher’s bidding, 
<br>being neither lazy nor restless—
<br>why then do I not achieve quenching? </p>

<p id="p114" class="verse"><span class="parno">114</span>
Having washed my feet, 
<br>I took note of the water, 
<br>seeing the foot-washing water 
<br>flowing from high ground to low. </p>

<p id="p115" class="verse"><span class="parno">115</span>
My mind became serene, 
<br>like a fine thoroughbred steed. 
<br>Then, taking a lamp, 
<br>I entered my dwelling, 
<br>inspected the bed, 
<br>and sat on my cot. </p>

<p id="p116" class="verse"><span class="parno">116</span>
Then, grabbing the pin, 
<br>I drew out the wick. 
<br>The liberation of my heart 
<br>was like the quenching of the lamp. </p>

<h5>Thirty Nuns</h5>

<p id="p117" class="verse"><span class="parno">117</span>
“Taking a pestle, 
<br>young men pound grain. 
<br>Supporting partners and children, 
<br>young men acquire wealth. </p>

<p id="p118" class="verse"><span class="parno">118</span>
Do the Buddha’s bidding, 
<br>you won’t regret it. 
<br>Having quickly washed your feet, 
<br>sit in a discreet place to meditate. 
<br>Devoted to serenity of heart, 
<br>do the Buddha’s bidding.” </p>

<p id="p119" class="verse"><span class="parno">119</span>
After hearing her words, 
<br>the instructions of Paṭācārā, 
<br>they washed their feet 
<br>and retired to a discreet place. 
<br>Devoted to serenity of heart, 
<br>they did the Buddha’s bidding. </p>

<p id="p120" class="verse"><span class="parno">120</span>
In the first watch of the night, 
<br>they recollected their past lives. 
<br>In the middle watch of the night, 
<br>they purified their clairvoyance. 
<br>In the last watch of the night, 
<br>they shattered the mass of darkness. </p>

<p id="p121" class="verse"><span class="parno">121</span>
They rose and paid homage at her feet: 
<br>“We have done your bidding; 
<br>we shall abide honoring you, 
<br>as the thirty gods honor Indra, 
<br>undefeated in battle. 
<br>Masters of the three knowledges, we are free of defilements.” </p>

<h5>Candā</h5>

<p id="p122" class="verse"><span class="parno">122</span>
I used to be in a sorry state. 
<br>As a childless widow, 
<br>bereft of friends or relatives, 
<br>I got neither food nor clothes. </p>

<p id="p123" class="verse"><span class="parno">123</span>
I took a bowl and a staff 
<br>and went begging from family to family. 
<br>For seven years I wandered, 
<br>burned by heat and cold. </p>

<p id="p124" class="verse"><span class="parno">124</span>
Then I saw a nun 
<br>receiving food and drink.

Out of compassion for me, 
<br>Paṭācārā gave me the going forth. 
<br>Then, having advised me,

<br>I did her bidding. 
<br>The lady’s advice was not in vain: 
<br>master of the three knowledges, I am free of defilements. </p>
