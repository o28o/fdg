<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span><span class="evam">Thus I heard:</span> At one time the Gracious One was dwelling near Sāvatthī, in Jeta's Wood, at Anāthapiṇḍika's monastery. Then at that time many and various sectarians, ascetics, brāhmaṇas, and wanderers were living at Sāvatthī, having various views, various likings, various tendencies, subject to dependence on various views, <span class="add">such as</span>:</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument, this view: "The world is eternal — this alone is the truth, <span class="add">all</span> else is foolish."</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument, this view: "The world is not eternal — this alone is the truth, <span class="add">all</span> else is foolish."</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument, this view: "The world is finite — this alone is the truth, <span class="add">all</span> else is foolish."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument, this view: "The world is infinite — this alone is the truth, <span class="add">all</span> else is foolish."</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument, this view: "That which is soul, that is <span class="add">also</span> the body — this alone is the truth, <span class="add">all</span> else is foolish."</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument, this view: "The soul is one thing, the body is another thing, — this alone is the truth, <span class="add">all</span> else is foolish."</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>There were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument, this view: "The individual exists after death — this alone is the truth, <span class="add">all</span> else is foolish."</p>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>But there were some ascetics and brāhmaṇas who were of this argument, this view: "The individual does not exist after death — this alone is the truth, <span class="add">all</span> else is foolish."</p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>They lived contending, quarelling, disputing, attacking each other with sharp tongues, <span class="add">saying</span>: "Such is Dhamma, such is not Dhamma; such is not Dhamma, such is Dhamma."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>Then many monks, having dressed in the morning time, after picking up their bowl and robe, entered Sāvatthī for alms. After walking for alms in Sāvatthī, while returning from the alms-round after the meal, they went to the Gracious One, and after going and worshipping the Gracious One, they sat down on one side. While sat on one side those monks said this to the Gracious One:</p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>"Wanderers from other sects, monks, are blind, without vision, they do not know what is good, they do not know what is not good, they do not know what is Dhamma, they do not know what is not Dhamma.

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>"Formerly, monks, in this Sāvatthī there was a certain King.

<p>"‘Yes, your Majesty’, said that man, monks, and after replying to the King, and after taking hold of all of those congenitally blind in Sāvatthī, he went to the King, and after going he said this to the King: ‘As many of those congenitally blind as there are in Sāvatthī, your Majesty, have assembled.’</p>

<p>"‘Then show an elephant, I say, to those congenitally blind.’</p>

<p>"‘Yes, your Majesty’, said that man, monks, and after replying to the King, he showed an elephant to those congenitally blind, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>"To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's head, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>

<p>"To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's ear, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>

<p>"To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's tusk, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>

<p>"To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's trunk, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>

<p>"To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's body, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>

<p>"To some of those congenitally blind he showed the elephant's leg, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘Such is an elephant, blind men!’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"Then, monks, that man, having shown the elephant to those congenitally blind, went to the King, and after going he said this to the King: ‘Those congenitally blind have seen the elephant, your Majesty, now is the time for whatever you are thinking, your Majesty.’</p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>"Then that King, monks, went to the congenitally blind, and after going he said this to those congenitally blind: ‘Did you see the elephant, blind men?’</p>

<p>"‘Yes, your Majesty, we did see the elephant.’</p>

<p>"‘Speak, blind men, <span class="add">and say</span>: "Such is an elephant." ’</p>

<hr>
<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>"Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant's head, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a pot.’</p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>"Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant's ear, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a winnowing fan. ’</p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>"Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant's tusk, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a ploughshare."</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>"Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant's trunk, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a plough-pole."</p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>"Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant's body, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a store-house’</p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>"Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant's leg, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a pillar.’</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>"Those congenitally blind who had seen the elephant's thighs, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a mortar.’</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>"Those congenitally blind who had seen the top of the elephant's tail, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a pestle.’</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>"Those congenitally blind who had seen the tip of the elephant's tail, monks, said this: ‘Such is an elephant, your Majesty, he is like a broom.’</p>

<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>"And they, <span class="add">saying</span>: ‘Such is an elephant, such is not an elephant; such is not an elephant, such is an elephant,’ hit each other with their fists, and with that, monks, the King was pleased.</p>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>"Just so, monks, wanderers from other sects are blind, without vision, they do not know what is good, they do not know what is not good, they do not know what is Dhamma, they do not know what is not Dhamma.

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>Then the Gracious One, having understood the significance of it, on that occasion uttered this exalted utterance:</p>
