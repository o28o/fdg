<h3>Origin story</h3>
<h4>First sub-story</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery, Venerable Channa was misbehaving. Then, when he was examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha, he spoke evasively, “Who has committed an offense? What offense was committed? In regard to what was it committed? How was it committed? Who are you talking about? What are you talking about?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How can Venerable Channa speak evasively when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha?”… 

“Is it true, Channa, that you did this?” 
</p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? 

This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, the Sangha should charge Channa with evasive speech. And he is to be charged like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk Channa speaks evasively when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should charge him with evasive speech. This is the motion. </p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk Channa speaks evasively when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha. The Sangha is charging him with evasive speech. Any monk who approves of charging him with evasive speech should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>The Sangha has charged the monk Channa with evasive speech. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>After rebuking Channa in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>


<hr>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">7</span>‘If a monk speaks evasively, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. </p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>Later, when Channa was again being examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha, he thought, “By speaking evasively I’ll commit an offense,” and he instead harassed the Sangha by remaining silent. </p>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “When he’s examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha, how can Venerable Channa harass the Sangha by remaining silent?” … “Is it true, Channa, that you did this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, the Sangha should charge Channa with harassment. And he is to be charged like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk Channa, when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha, harasses the Sangha by remaining silent. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should charge him with harassment. This is the motion. </p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk Channa, when examined about an offense in the midst of the Sangha, harasses the Sangha by remaining silent. The Sangha is charging him with harassment. Any monk who approves of charging him of harassment should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>The Sangha has charged the monk Channa with harassment. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>After rebuking Channa in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">14</span>‘If a monk speaks evasively or harasses, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p><span class="parno">15</span><strong>One who speaks evasively: </strong> when being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense, he speaks evasively because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it, saying, “Who has committed an offense? What offense was committed? In regard to what was it committed? How was it committed? Who are you talking about? What are you talking about?”—this is called “one who speaks evasively”. </p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span><strong>One who harasses: </strong> when being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense, he harasses the Sangha by remaining silent because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it—this is called “one who harasses”. </p>

<h3>Permutations </h3>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>If he has not been charged with evasive speech, but he is being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense, and he then speaks evasively because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it, saying, “Who has committed an offense? What offense was committed? In regard to what was it committed? How was it committed? Who are you talking about? What are you talking about?” then he commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p>If he has not been charged with harassment, but he is being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense, and he then harasses the Sangha by remaining silent because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it, then he commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p>If he has been charged with evasive speech, and he is being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense, and he then speaks evasively because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it, saying, </p>

<p>“Who has committed an offense? What offense was committed? In regard to what was it committed? How was it committed? Who are you talking about? What are you talking about?” then he commits an offense entailing confession. </p>

<p>If he has been charged with harassment, and he is being examined in the midst of the Sangha about an action that was the basis for an offense or about the class of an offense, and he then harasses the Sangha by remaining silent because he does not want to talk about it or reveal it, then he commits an offense entailing confession. </p>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and he perceives it as such, and he speaks evasively or he harasses, he commits an offense entailing confession. If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, and he speaks evasively or he harasses, he commits an offense entailing confession. If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he perceives it as illegitimate, and he speaks evasively or he harasses, he commits an offense entailing confession. </p>

<p>If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but he perceives it as legitimate, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, and he perceives it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<h3>Non-offenses </h3>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>There is no offense: if he asks because he does not know; if he does not speak because he is sick; if he does not speak because he thinks there will be quarrels or disputes in the Sangha; if he does not speak because he thinks there will be a fracture or schism in the Sangha; if he does not speak because he thinks the legal procedure will be illegitimate, done by an incomplete assembly, or done to one who does not deserve a legal procedure; if he is insane; if he is the first offender. </p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">20</span>The training rule on evasive speech, the second, is finished. </p>
