<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, the monks from the group of six were engaged in malicious talebearing between monks who were arguing. After hearing something on one side they reported it to the other side, and vice versa, in order to create division between them. In this way they started new quarrels and made existing quarrels worse. </p>

<hr>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How can the monks from the group of six engage in malicious talebearing between monks who are arguing? How can they report to one side what they have heard on the other side, and vice versa, in order to create division, and in this way start new quarrels and make existing quarrels worse?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned those monks: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” 
</p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how can you do this? 


This will affect people’s confidence …” … 


“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>


<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">3</span>‘If a monk engages in malicious talebearing between monks, he commits an offense entailing confession.’” </p>


<h3>Definitions </h3>


<p><span class="parno">4</span><strong>Malicious talebearing: </strong> there is malicious talebearing in two ways: for one wanting to endear himself and for one aiming at division. One engages in malicious talebearing in ten ways: about caste, about name, about family, about occupation, about profession, about illnesses, about physical traits, about defilements, about offenses, and by name-calling. </p>

<h3>Permutations  </h3>

<h4>Definitions </h4>

<p><span class="parno">5</span><strong>Caste: </strong> there are two kinds of castes: low castes and high castes.</p>

<p><strong>Low castes: </strong> outcasts, bamboo workers, hunters, carriage makers, waste removers—these are called “low castes”. </p>

<p><strong>High castes: </strong> aristocrats and brahmins—these are called “high castes”. </p>

<p><span class="add">To be expanded as in previous rule. </span></p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span><strong>Name-calling: </strong> there are two kinds of name-calling: low name-calling and high name-calling. </p>

<p><strong>Low name-calling: </strong> “You’re a camel,” “You’re a ram,” “You’re an ox,” “You’re a donkey,” “You’re an animal,” “You’re bound for hell,” “You’re not going to a good destination,” “You can only expect a bad destination,” or adding disparaging endings to someone’s name, or calling someone words for the male and female genitals—this is called “low name-calling”. </p>

<p><strong>High name-calling: </strong> “You’re wise,” “You’re competent,” “You’re intelligent,” “You’re learned,” “You’re an expounder of the Teaching,” “You’re not going to a bad destination,” “You can only expect a good destination”—this is called “high name-calling”. </p>
