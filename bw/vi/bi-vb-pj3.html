<h3>Origin story</h3>
<h4>First sub-story</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near Vesālī. At that time the Buddha spoke to the monks in many ways about unattractiveness—he spoke in praise of unattractiveness, of developing the mind in unattractiveness, and of the attainment of unattractiveness. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>The Buddha then addressed the monks: “Monks, I wish to go into solitary retreat for half a month. No one should visit me except the one who brings me almsfood.” </p>

<p>“Yes, Venerable Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>Soon afterwards the monks reflected that the Buddha had praised unattractiveness in many ways, and they devoted themselves to developing the mind in unattractiveness in its many different facets. As a consequence, they became troubled by their own bodies, ashamed of and disgusted with them. Just as a young woman or man—someone fond of adornments, with freshly washed hair—would be ashamed, humiliated, and disgusted if the carcass of a snake, dog, or man was hung around her neck, just so those monks were troubled by their own bodies. They took their own lives, took the lives of one another, and they went to Migalaṇḍika, the monastic lookalike, and said, “Please kill us. You will get our bowl and robes.” And hired for a bowl and robes, Migalaṇḍika killed a number of monks. He then took his blood-stained knife to the river Vaggumudā. </p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>While washing it, he became anxious and remorseful, thinking, “What the heck have I done? I’ve made so much demerit by killing good monks.” </p>

<p>Then a god from the realm of the Lord of Death, coming across the water, said to Migalaṇḍika, “Well done, superior man, you’re truly fortunate. You’ve made much merit by helping across those who hadn’t yet crossed.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>Migalaṇḍika thought, “So it seems that I’m fortunate, that I’ve made much merit!” He then went from dwelling to dwelling, from yard to yard, and said, “Who hasn’t crossed yet? Who can I help across?” The monks who still had worldly attachments became fearful and terrified, with goosebumps all over. Only those who were free from worldly attachments were unaffected. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>Then, on a single day, Migalaṇḍika killed one monk, two monks, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, even sixty monks. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>At the end of that half-month, when the Buddha came out of seclusion, he said to Venerable Ānanda, “Ānanda, why is the Sangha of monks so reduced?” </p>

<hr>

<p>Ānanda told him what had happened, adding, “Please give another instruction, Venerable Sir, for the Sangha of monks to become established in perfect insight.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, Ānanda, bring together in the assembly hall all the monks who live supported by Vesālī.” </p>

<p>“Yes.” When he had done so, he went to the Buddha and said, “Sir, the Sangha of monks is gathered. Please do as you think appropriate.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>The Buddha then went to the assembly hall, sat down on the prepared seat, and addressed the monks: </p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>“Monks, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is peaceful and sublime, and a satisfying state of bliss. And it removes bad and unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. Just as a great, unseasonal storm in the last month of the hot season removes the dust and dirt from the air, just so, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated, it is peaceful and sublime, and it removes bad and unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>And how is stillness by mindfulness of breathing developed and cultivated in this way? </p>

<p>A monk sits down in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty hut. He crosses his legs, straightens his body, and sets up mindfulness in front of him. Simply mindful, he breathes in; mindful, he breathes out. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>When he breathes in long, he knows it; and when he breathes out long, he knows that. </p>

<p>When he breathes in short, he knows it; and when he breathes out short, he knows that. </p>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in fully experiencing the breath; when breathing out, he trains in fully experiencing the breath. </p>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the body; when breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the body. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>When breathing in, he trains in experiencing joy; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing joy. </p>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in experiencing bliss; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing bliss. </p>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing the activity of the mind. </p>

<hr>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in calming the activity of the mind; when breathing out, he trains in calming the activity of the mind. </p>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in experiencing the mind; when breathing out, he trains in experiencing the mind. </p>

<hr>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in gladdening the mind; when breathing out, he trains in gladdening the mind. </p>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in stilling the mind; when breathing out, he trains in stilling the mind. </p>

<hr>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in freeing the mind; when breathing out, he trains in freeing the mind. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>When breathing in, he trains in contemplating impermanence; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating impermanence. </p>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in contemplating fading away; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating fading away. </p>

<hr>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in contemplating ending; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating ending. </p>

<p>When breathing in, he trains in contemplating relinquishment; when breathing out, he trains in contemplating relinquishment. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>Monks, when stillness by mindfulness of breathing is developed and cultivated like this, it is peaceful and sublime, and a satisfying state of bliss. And it removes bad and unwholesome qualities on the spot, whenever they arise.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>The Buddha then had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that there are monks who have taken their own lives, who have killed one another, and who have said to Migalaṇḍika, ‘Please kill us. You will get our bowl and robes’?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “Monks, it’s not suitable for these monks, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it should not be done. How could those monks do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">16</span>‘If a monk intentionally kills a human being or seeks an instrument of death for them, he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. </p>

<h4>Second sub-story </h4>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>At one time a certain lay follower was sick. He had a beautiful and pleasant wife, who the monks from the group of six had fallen in love with. They said to each other, “If this lay follower recovers, we won’t get her. Come, let’s praise death to him.” </p>

<p>They then went to that lay follower and said, “You’ve done what’s good and wholesome; you’ve made a shelter against fear. You haven’t done anything bad; you haven’t been greedy or immoral. So why carry on with this miserable and difficult life? Death is better for you. When you’ve passed away, you’ll be reborn in a happy place, in heaven. There you’ll be able to enjoy the pleasures of heaven.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>That lay follower thought, “The venerables have spoken the truth, for I’ve done what’s good and avoided what’s bad, and after death I’ll be reborn in a happy place.” </p>

<p>From then on he ate various kinds of detrimental food and drank detrimental drinks, and as a consequence, he became very ill and died. </p>

<hr>

<p>But his wife complained and criticized those monks, “These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. They claim to have integrity, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and good. But they don’t have the good character of a monastic or brahmin. They’ve lost the plot! They praised death to my husband, and as a result my husband is dead.” </p>

<hr>

<p>And other people complained and criticized them in the same way. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>The monks heard the criticism of those people. Those monks who had few desires and a sense of conscience, who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized those monks, “How could they praise death to that lay follower?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span>After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha … </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “Foolish men, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it should not be done. How could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">22</span>‘If a monk intentionally kills a human being or seeks an instrument of death for him or praises death or incites someone to die, saying, “My friend, what’s the point of this miserable and difficult life? Death is better for you than life!”—thinking and intending thus, if he praises death in many ways or incites someone to die—he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p><span class="parno">23</span><strong>A: </strong> whoever … </p>

<p><strong>Monk: </strong>… The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. </p>

<p><span class="parno">24</span><strong>Intentionally: </strong> knowing, perceiving, having intended, having decided, he transgresses. </p>

<p><span class="parno">25</span><strong>A human being: </strong> from the mind’s first appearance in the mother’s womb, from the first manifestation of consciousness, until the time of death: in between these—this is called “a human being”. </p>

<p><span class="parno">26</span><strong>Kills: </strong> Cuts off the life faculty, brings it to an end, interrupts its continuation. </p>

<p><span class="parno">27</span><strong>Or seeks an instrument of death for him: </strong> a sword, a dagger, an arrow, a club, a rock, a knife, poison, or a rope. </p>
<p><span class="parno">28</span><strong>Or praises death: </strong> he shows the disadvantage in living and speaks in praise of death. </p>

<p><span class="parno">29</span><strong>Or incites someone to die: </strong> he says, “Kill yourself with a knife,” “Eat poison,” “Die by hanging yourself with a rope.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">30</span><strong>My friend: </strong> this is a form of address. </p>

<p><span class="parno">31</span><strong>What’s the point of this miserable and difficult life: </strong> Miserable life: the life of the poor is miserable compared to the life of the rich; the life of the impoverished is miserable compared to the life of the wealthy; the life of humans is miserable compared to the life of the gods. </p>

<p><span class="parno">32</span><strong>Difficult life: </strong> the life of one whose hands are cut off, whose feet are cut off, whose hands and feet are cut off, whose ears are cut off, whose nose is cut off, whose ears and nose are cut off. Because of this sort of miserableness and this sort of difficult life, one says, “Death is better for you than life!” </p>

<p><span class="parno">33</span><strong>Thinking: </strong> mind and thought are equivalent. </p>

<p><span class="parno">34</span><strong>Intending: </strong> perceiving death, intending death, aiming at death. </p>

<p><span class="parno">35</span><strong>In many ways: </strong> in various manners. </p>

<p><span class="parno">36</span><strong>He praises death: </strong> he shows the disadvantage in living and speaks in praise of death, saying, “When you’ve passed away, you’ll be reborn in a happy destination, in heaven. There you’ll be able to enjoy the pleasures of heaven.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">37</span><strong>Or incites someone to die: </strong> he says, “Kill yourself with a knife,” “Eat poison,” “Die by hanging yourself with a rope,” “Jump into a chasm,” “Jump into a pit,” “Jump off a cliff.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">38</span><strong>He too: </strong> this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion. </p>

<p><span class="parno">39</span><strong>Is expelled: </strong> just as an ordinary stone that has broken in half cannot be put back together again, so too is a monk who has intentionally killed a human being not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. Therefore it is said, “he is expelled.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">40</span><strong>Excluded from the community: </strong> Community: joint legal procedures, a joint recitation, the same training—this is called “community”. He does not take part in this—therefore it is called “excluded from the community”. </p>
