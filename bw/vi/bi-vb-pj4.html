<h3>Origin story</h3>
<h4>First sub-story</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood near Vesālī, a number of monks who were friends had entered the rainy-season residence on the banks of the river Vaggumudā. At that time Vajjī was short of food and afflicted with hunger, with crops affected by whiteheads and turned to straw. It was not easy to get by on almsfood. </p>

<p>The monks considered the difficult circumstances, and they thought, “How can we have a comfortable rains, live in peace and harmony, and get almsfood without trouble?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>Some said: “We could work for the householders, and they’ll support us in return.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>Others said, “There’s no need to work for the householders. Let’s instead take messages for them, and they’ll support us in return.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>Still others said, “There’s no need to work or take messages for them. Let’s instead talk up one another’s superhuman qualities to the householders: ‘That monk has the first absorption, that monk the second absorption, that monk the third, that monk the fourth; that monk is a stream-enterer, that monk a once-returner, that a non-returner, that a perfected one; that monk has the three true insights, and that the six direct knowledges.’ Then they’ll support us. In this way we’ll have a comfortable rains, live together in peace and harmony, and get almsfood without trouble. This is the way to go.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>Then those monks did just that. And the people there thought, “We’re so fortunate that such monks have come to us for the rainy-season residence. Such virtuous and good monks have never before entered the rains residence with us.” And they gave such food and drink to those monks that they did not even eat and drink themselves, or give to their parents, to their wives and children, to their slaves, servants, and workers, to their friends and companions, or to their relatives. Soon those monks had a good color, bright faces, clear skin, and  sharp senses. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainy-season residence to go and visit the Buddha. And so, when the three months were over and they had completed the rains residence, those monks put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Vesālī. When they eventually arrived, they went to the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. There they approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. </p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>At that time the monks who had completed the rains residence in that region were thin, haggard, and pale, with veins protruding all over their bodies. Yet the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā had a good color, bright faces, clear skin, and  sharp senses. Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said to the: “I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by? </p>

<p>I hope you had a comfortable and harmonious rains, and got almsfood without trouble?” </p>

<p>“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. We had a comfortable and harmonious rains, and got almsfood without trouble.” </p>

<hr>

<p>When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>And the Buddha said to those monks, “In what way, monks, did you have a comfortable and harmonious rains? And how did you get almsfood without trouble?” </p>

<p>They then told him. </p>

<p>“But did you really have those superhuman qualities?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“No, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “It’s not suitable, foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you for the sake of your stomachs talk up one another’s superhuman qualities to householders? It would be better for your bellies to be cut open with a sharp butcher’s knife than for you to talk up one another’s superhuman qualities to householders. Why is that? For although it might cause death or death-like suffering, it would not cause you to be reborn in a bad destination. But <em>this</em> might. This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them and giving a teaching, he addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>“Monks, there are these five notorious gangsters to be found in the world. What five? There are notorious gangsters who think like this: ‘When the heck will I walk about in villages, towns, and royal capitals, with a following of a hundred or a thousand men, killing, destroying, and torturing?’ Then after some time, he does just that. Just so, monks, a bad monk thinks like this: ‘When the heck will I walk about in villages, towns, and royal capitals, with a following of a hundred or a thousand people, being honored, respected, and revered by both lay people and those gone forth, getting robes, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies?’ Then after some time, he does just that. This is the first notorious gangster to be found in the world. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>Or a bad monk learns the spiritual path proclaimed by the Buddha and takes it as his own. This is the second notorious gangster to be found in the world. </p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>Or a bad monk groundlessly charges someone living a pure spiritual life with a sexual offense. This is the third notorious gangster to be found in the world. </p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>Or a bad monk takes valuable goods and requisites from the Sangha—a monastery, the land of a monastery, a dwelling, the site of a dwelling, a bed, a bench, a mattress, a pillow, a metal pot, a metal jar, a metal bucket, a metal bowl, a machete, a hatchet, an ax, a spade, a chisel, a creeper, bamboo, a reed, grass, clay, wooden goods, earthenware goods—and uses them to bribe and create a following among householders. This is the fourth notorious gangster to be found in the world. </p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>But in this world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, this is the most notorious gangster of all: one who claims to have a non-existent superhuman quality. Why is that? Monks, you’ve eaten the country’s almsfood by theft.” </p>

<hr>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">14</span>“Whoever should declare himself <br>
To be other than he truly is, <br>
Has eaten this by theft, <br>
Like a cheater who has deceived. </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">15</span>Many ocher-necks of bad qualities, <br>
Uncontrolled and wicked—<br>
By their wicked deeds, <br>
They are reborn in hell. </p>

<p class="verse"><span class="parno">16</span>It’s better to eat an iron ball, <br>
As hot as a licking flame, <br>
Than for the immoral and uncontrolled <br>
To eat the country’s alms.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>After rebuking the monks from the banks of the Vaggumudā in many ways for being difficult to maintain, difficult to support … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">18</span>‘If a monk falsely claims for himself a superhuman quality, a knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying, “This I know, this I see,” but after some time—whether questioned or not, but having committed the offense and seeking purification—should say: “Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,” he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. </p>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>Soon afterwards a number of monks, thinking they had seen and realized what in fact they had not, declared final knowledge because of overestimation. After some time, their minds inclined to sensual desire, ill will, and confusion. They became anxious, thinking, “The Buddha has laid down a training rule, yet we declared final knowledge because of overestimation. Could it be that we’ve committed an offense entailing expulsion?” They told Venerable Ānanda, who told the Buddha. He said, “This is negligible, Ānanda. 
</p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span>And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">22</span>‘If a monk falsely claims for himself a superhuman quality, a knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying, “This I know, this I see,” but after some time—whether he is questioned or not, but having committed the offense and seeking purification—should say: “Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,” then, except if it is due to overestimation, he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p><span class="parno">23</span><strong>A: </strong> whoever … <strong>Monk: </strong> … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">24</span><strong>Falsely: </strong> although a certain wholesome quality is non-existent in himself, not real, not to be found, and he does not see it or know it, he says, “I have this wholesome quality.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">25</span><strong>A superhuman quality: </strong> absorption, release, stillness, attainment, knowledge and vision, development of the path, realization of the fruits, abandoning the defilements, a mind without hindrances, delighting in solitude. </p>

<p><span class="parno">26</span><strong>For himself: </strong> either he presents those good qualities as in himself, or he presents himself as among those good qualities. </p>

<p><span class="parno">27</span><strong>Knowledge: </strong> the three true insights. <strong> Vision: </strong> knowledge and vision are equivalent. </p>

<p><span class="parno">28</span><strong>Claims: </strong> announces to a woman or a man, to a lay person or one gone forth. </p>

<p><span class="parno">29</span><strong>This I know, this I see: </strong> “I know these qualities,” “I see these qualities,” “These qualities are found in me and I conform to them.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">30</span><strong>After some time: </strong> the moment, the second, the instant after he has made the claim. </p>

<p><span class="parno">31</span><strong>He is questioned: </strong> he is questioned in regard to what he has claimed: “What did you attain?” “How did you attain it?” “When did you attain it?” “Where did you attain it?” “Which defilements did you abandon?” “Which qualities did you gain?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">32</span><strong>Not: </strong> he is not spoken to by anyone. </p>

<p><span class="parno">33</span><strong>Having committed the offense: </strong> having bad desires, overcome by desire, claiming to have a non-existent, unreal superhuman quality, he has committed an offense entailing expulsion. </p>

<p><span class="parno">34</span><strong>Seeking purification: </strong> he desires to be a householder, a lay follower, a monastery worker, or a novice monk. </p>


<p><span class="parno">35</span><strong>Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see: </strong> “I don’t know these qualities,” “I don’t see these qualities,” “These qualities aren’t found in me and I don’t conform to them.” </p>


<p><span class="parno">36</span><strong>What I said was empty and false: </strong> “What I said was empty,” “What I said was false,” “What I said was unreal,” “I said it without knowing.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">37</span><strong>Except if it is due to overestimation: </strong> Unless it is due to overestimation. </p>

<p><span class="parno">38</span><strong>He too: </strong> this is said with reference to the preceding offenses entailing expulsion. </p>

<p><span class="parno">39</span><strong>Is expelled: </strong> just as a palm tree with its crown cut off is incapable of further growth, so too is a monk with bad desires, overcome by desire, who claims to have a non-existent superhuman quality not an ascetic, not a Sakyan monastic. Therefore it is said, “he is expelled.” </p>


<p><span class="parno">40</span><strong>Excluded from the community: </strong> Community: joint legal procedures, a joint recitation, the same training—this is called “community”. He does not take part in this—therefore it is called “excluded from the community”. </p>

<p><span class="parno">209</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary, Venerable Lakkhaṇa and Venerable Mahāmoggallāna were staying on the Vulture Peak. One morning Mahāmoggallāna robed up, took his bowl and robe, went to Lakkhaṇa, and said, “Lakkhaṇa, let’s enter Rājagaha for almsfood.” </p>

<hr>
