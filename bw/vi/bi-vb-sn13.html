<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the nun Thullanandā had been pressed by the Sangha. She then said to the nuns, “But, Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety,  and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses. The Sangha says nothing to them. It’s because of disrespect, contempt, impatience, and slander, and because you are weak that the Sangha says to you, ‘Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.’” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>The nuns of few desires complained and criticized her:</p>

<p>“How could Venerable Thullanandā, after being pressed by the Sangha, say this to the nuns?” … :</p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that after being pressed by the Sangha, the nun Thullanandā said this to the nuns?”</p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked her … </p>

<p>“How could the nun Thullanandā, after being pressed by the Sangha, say this to the nuns?


This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, the nuns should recite this training rule like this: </p>


<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">3</span>‘If a nun says, “Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety, and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses. The Sangha says nothing to them. It’s because of disrespect, contempt, impatience, and slander, and because you are weak that the Sangha says to you, ‘Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters,’” then the nuns should correct her like this: “Venerable, don’t say such things: ‘Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety, and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses. The Sangha says nothing to them. It’s because of disrespect, contempt, impatience, and slander, and because you are weak that the Sangha says to you, “Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.”’” If that nun continues as before, the nuns should press her up to three times to make her stop. If she then stops, all is well. If she does not stop, then after the third announcement that nun too has committed an offense entailing sending away and suspension.’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>


<p><span class="parno">4</span><strong>A: </strong> whoever … <strong>Nun: </strong> … The nun who has been given the full ordination in unanimity by both Sanghas through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of nun is meant in this case. </p>


<hr>

<p><span class="parno">5</span><strong>Says: </strong> “Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety, and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses. The Sangha says nothing to them.” </p>


<p><span class="parno">6</span><strong>It’s because of disrespect that the Sangha … to you: </strong> because of despising. </p>


<p><span class="parno">7</span><strong>Because of contempt: </strong> because of contemptuousness. </p>


<hr>

<p><span class="parno">8</span><strong>Because of impatience: </strong> because of irritation. </p>


<p><span class="parno">9</span><strong>Because of slander: </strong> Because of slandering. </p>


<p><span class="parno">10</span><strong>Because … weak: </strong> Because of lack of supporters. </p>

<hr>


<p><span class="parno">11</span><strong>Says: </strong> “Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.” </p>


<p><span class="parno">12</span><strong>Her: </strong> that nun who speaks thus. </p>


<hr>

<p><span class="parno">13</span><strong>The nuns: </strong></p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>Other nuns who see it or hear about it. They should correct her like this: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Venerable, don’t say such things: ‘Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. There are other nuns in the Sangha … “… Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.”’” </p>

<p>And they should correct her a second and a third time. If she stops, all is well. If she does not stop, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If those who heard about it do not say anything, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p>That nun, even if she has to be pulled into the Sangha, should be corrected like this: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Venerable, don’t say such things: ‘Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. There are other nuns in the Sangha … “… Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.”’” </p>

<p>They should correct her a second and a third time. If she stops, all is well. If she does not stop, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>


<p>Should press her: “And, monks, she should be pressed like this. A competent and capable nun should inform the Sangha: </p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The nun so-and-so, after being pressed by the Sangha, says this to the nuns, “Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety, and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses. The Sangha says nothing to them. It’s because of disrespect, contempt, impatience, and slander, and because you are weak that the Sangha says to you, ‘Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.’” And she keeps on saying it. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should press her to make her stop. This is the motion. </p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The nun so-and-so, after being pressed by the Sangha, says this to the nuns, “Venerables, you should socialize. Don’t live separately. There are other nuns in the Sangha who have such behavior, reputation, and notoriety, and who harass the Sangha of nuns and hide each other’s offenses. The Sangha says nothing to them. It’s because of disrespect, contempt, impatience, and slander, and because you are weak that the Sangha says to you, ‘Sisters, you socialize, behave badly, have a bad reputation, are notorious, harass the Sangha of nuns, and hide each other’s offenses. Be secluded, Venerables. The Sangha praises seclusion for the Sisters.’” And she keeps on saying it. The Sangha presses her to make her stop. Any nun who approves of pressing her to make her stop should remain silent. Any nun who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>For the second time I speak on this matter … For the third time I speak on this matter … </p>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>The Sangha has pressed nun so-and-so to stop. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>After the motion, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. After each of the first two announcements, she commits a serious offense. When the last announcement is finished, she commits an offense entailing suspension. For one who commits the offense entailing suspension, the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulled. </p>


<hr>

<p><span class="parno">20</span><strong>That too: </strong> this is said with reference to the preceding offenses. </p>


<p><span class="parno">21</span><strong>After the third announcement: </strong> there is an offense when she has been pressed for the third time, not as soon as the misconduct has been committed. </p>


<p><span class="parno">22</span><strong>Entailing sending away: </strong> she is sent away from the Sangha. </p>


<p><span class="parno">23</span><strong>Suspension: </strong> only the Sangha gives the trial period for that offense, sends back to the beginning, and rehabilitates—not several nuns, not an individual nun. Therefore it is called an offense entailing suspension. This is the name and designation of this class of offense. Therefore, too, it is called an offense entailing suspension. </p>


<h3>Permutations </h3>

<p><span class="parno">24</span>If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and she perceives it as such, and she does not stop, she commits an offense entailing suspension. If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but she is unsure of it, and she does not stop, she commits an offense entailing suspension. If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but she perceives it as illegitimate, and she does not stop, she commits an offense entailing suspension. </p>

<p><span class="parno">25</span>If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but she perceives it as legitimate, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but she is unsure of it, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, and she perceives it as such, she commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<h3>Non-offenses </h3>

<p><span class="parno">26</span>There is no offense: if she has not been pressed; if she stops; if she is insane; if she is the first offender. </p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">27</span>The thirteenth offense entailing suspension is finished. </p>


<h3>&nbsp;</h3>


<p><span class="parno">28</span>“Venerables, the seventeen rules on suspension have been recited, nine being immediate offenses, eight after the third announcement. If a nun commits any one of them, she must undertake a trial period for a half-month toward both Sanghas. When this is completed, she is to be rehabilitated wherever there is a saṅgha of at least twenty nuns. If that nun is rehabilitated by a saṅgha of nuns of even one less than twenty, then that nun is not rehabilitated and those nuns are at fault. This is proper procedure. </p>


<p><span class="parno">29</span>In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?’ A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ You are pure in this and therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.” </p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">30</span>The group of seventeen is finished. <br>
The chapter on offenses entailing suspension in the Nuns’ Analysis is finished. </p>
