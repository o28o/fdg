<h3>Origin story</h3>
<h4>First sub-story</h4>
</div>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery, Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī. </p>

<p>When Udāyī saw a young man without a wife or a young woman without a husband, he would praise the young woman to the parents of a young man, “The young woman of such-and such a family is beautiful, intelligent, skilled, and diligent. She’s suitable for your son.” They would reply, “They don’t know who we are, Venerable. If you could persuade them to give the girl, we would take her for our son.” </p>

<p>And he praised the young man to the parents of a young woman, “The young man of such-and-such a family is handsome, intelligent, skilled, and diligent. He’s suitable for your daughter.” They would reply, “They don’t know who we are, Venerable, and we would be ashamed to speak to them for the sake of the girl. But if you could persuade them to ask us, we would give our girl to the young man.” In this way he arranged for the taking of a bride, for the giving of a bride, and for marriage. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>At that time there was a former courtesan who had a beautiful daughter. On one occasion some lay followers of the Ājīvaka religion came from another village and said to that courtesan, “Madam, please give your girl to our boy.” </p>

<p>“I don’t know who you are, Sirs, and I won’t give my only daughter to be taken to another village.” </p>

<p>People asked those Ājīvaka lay followers why they had come. </p>

<p>They replied, “We came to ask that courtesan to give her daughter to our son, but she refused.” 
</p>

<p>“But why did you ask the courtesan? You should speak to Venerable Udāyī. He’ll persuade her.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>They then went to Udāyī and said, “Venerable, we’ve asked that courtesan here to give her daughter to our son, but she refused. Would you please persuade her to give her daughter?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>Udāyī agreed. Soon afterwards he went to that courtesan and said, “Why didn’t you give them your daughter?” </p>

<p>“I don’t know who they are, Sir, and I won’t give my only daughter to be taken to another village.” </p>

<p>“Please give her to them. I know them.” </p>

<p>“If you know them, I’ll give her away.” </p>

<p>She then gave her daughter to those Ājīvaka followers, and they took her away. For a month they treated her like a daughter-in-law, but then like a slave. </p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>The girl sent a message to her mother, saying, “Mom, I’m unhappy and miserable. For a month they treated me like a daughter-in-law, but then like a slave. Come, mom, and take me home.” </p>

<p>Soon afterwards the courtesan went to those Ājīvakas and said, “Please don’t treat my girl like a slave; treat her properly!” </p>

<p>They replied, “We deal with the monastic, not with you. Go away! We don’t want anything to do with you.” Being dismissed, she returned to Sāvatthī. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>A second time the girl sent the same message to her mother. </p>

<p>That courtesan then went to Udāyī and said, “Venerable, my girl is unhappy and miserable. They treated her like a daughter-in-law for a month, but then like a slave. Please tell them to treat her properly.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>Udāyī went to the Ājīvakas and said, “Please don’t treat this girl like a slave; treat her properly.” </p>

<p>They replied, “We deal with the courtesan, not with you. A monastic shouldn’t get involved. You should behave like a proper monastic. So go away! We don’t want anything to do with you.” Being dismissed, he returned to Sāvatthī. </p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>A third time that girl sent the same message to her mother, and a second time the courtesan went to Udāyī and told him the same thing. </p>

<p>He replied, “When I first went, they just dismissed me. Go yourself; I’m not going.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>Then that courtesan complained and criticized him, “May Venerable Udāyī be miserable and unhappy, just as my girl is miserable and unhappy because of her nasty mother-in-law, father-in-law, and husband.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10-11</span>The girl, too, complained and criticized him in the same way, as did other women who were unhappy with their mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, and husbands. 
</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>But those women who were happy with their in-laws wished him well, saying, “May Venerable Udāyī be happy and well, just as we are happy and well because of our good mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, and husbands.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>The monks heard that some women were criticizing him whereas others were wishing him well. And the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>They told the Buddha. The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: </p>

<p>“Is it true, Udāyī, that you do this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">15</span>‘If a monk acts as a matchmaker, conveying a man’s intention to a woman or a woman’s intention to a man, for marriage or for an affair, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. </p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>Soon afterwards a number of scoundrels who were enjoying themselves in a park sent a messenger to a sex worker, saying, “Please come, let’s enjoy ourselves in the park.” </p>

<p>She replied, “Sirs, I don’t know who you are. I’m wealthy. I don’t want to go outside the city.” 
</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>The messenger returned the message. A certain man then said to those men, “Why did you ask the sex worker? You should speak to Venerable Udāyī. He’ll persuade her.” </p>

<p>But a certain Buddhist lay follower said, “No way. That’s not allowable for the Sakyan monastics. He won’t do it.” And they made a bet on whether he would. </p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>Those scoundrels then went to Udāyī and said, “Venerable, while we were enjoying ourselves in the park, we sent a message to such-and-such a sex worker, asking her to come, but she refused. Would you please persuade her?” Udāyī agreed. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>He then went to that sex worker and said, “Why don’t you go to those men?” </p>

<p>She told him why. </p>

<hr>

<p>“Please go. I know them.” </p>

<p>“If you know them, Sir, I’ll go.” And those men took her to the park. </p>

<hr>

<p>Then that lay follower complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">21</span>The monks heard it, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Udāyī act as a matchmaker for a brief affair?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">22</span>They rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: </p>

<p>“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">23</span>‘If a monk acts as a matchmaker, conveying a man’s intention to a woman or a woman’s intention to a man, for marriage or for an affair, even if just a brief one, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” </p>
