<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, Venerable Dabba the Mallian realized perfection at the age of seven. He had achieved all there is to achieve by a disciple and had nothing further to do. </p>

<p>Then, while reflecting in private, he thought, “How can I be of service to the Sangha? </p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>Why don’t I assign the dwellings and designate the meals?” </p>

<hr>

<p>In the evening Dabba came out of seclusion and went to the Buddha. He bowed, sat down, and said, “Venerable Sir, while I was reflecting in private, it occurred to me that I’ve achieved all there is to achieve by a disciple, and I was wondering how I could be of service to the Sangha. I thought, ‘Why don’t I assign the dwellings and designate the meals?’” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Good, good, Dabba, please do so.” </p>

<p>“Yes.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: “Monks, the Sangha should appoint Dabba the Mallian as the assigner of dwellings and the designator of meals. And he should be appointed like this. First Dabba should be asked. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Sangha: </p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals. This is the motion. </p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The Sangha appoints Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals. Any monk who approves of appointing Venerable Dabba as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>The Sangha has appointed Venerable Dabba the Mallian as assigner of dwellings and designator of meals. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>Dabba assigned dwellings to the monks according to their character. He assigned dwellings in the same place to those monks who were experts on the discourses, thinking, “They’ll recite the discourses to one another.” And he did likewise for the experts on the Monastic Law, thinking, “They’ll discuss the Monastic Law;” for the expounders of the Teaching, thinking, “They’ll discuss the Teaching;” for the meditators, thinking, “They won’t disturb each other;” and for the gossips and the body-builders, thinking, “In this way even these venerables will be happy.” </p>

<p>When monks arrived at night, he entered the fire element and assigned dwellings with the help of that light. Monks even arrived late on purpose, hoping to see the marvel of Dabba’s supernormal powers. </p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>They would approach Dabba and say, “Venerable Dabba, please assign us a dwelling.” </p>

<p>“Where would you like to stay?” </p>

<p>They would intentionally suggest somewhere far away: “On the Vulture Peak,” “At Robbers’ Cliff,” “On Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili,” “In the Sattapaṇṇi Cave on the slope of Mount Vebhāra,” “In Cool Grove on the hill at the Snake’s Pool,” “At Gotamaka Gorge,” “At Tinduka Gorge,” “At Tapoda Gorge,” “In Tapoda Park,” “In Jīvaka’s Mango Grove,” “In the deer park at Maddakucchi.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>Dabba then entered the fire element, and with his finger glowing, he walked in front of those monks. They followed behind him with the help of that light. And he would assign them dwellings: “This is the bed, this the bench, this the mattress, this the pillow, this the place for defecating, this the place for urinating, this the water for drinking, this the water for washing, this the walking stick; these are the Sangha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave.” Dabba then returned to the Bamboo Grove. </p>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>At that time the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were only newly ordained. They had little merit, getting inferior dwellings and meals. The people of Rājagaha were keen to give specially prepared almsfood to the senior monks—ghee, oil, and special curries—but to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka they gave ordinary food of porridge and broken rice. </p>

<p>When they had eaten their meal and returned from alms round, they asked the senior monks: “What did you get at the dining hall?” </p>

<p>Some said, “We got ghee, oil, and special curries.” </p>

<p>But the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said: “We didn’t get anything except ordinary food of porridge and broken rice.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>At that time there was a householder who gave a regular meal of fine food to four monks. He made his offering in the dining hall together with his wives and children. Some of them offered rice, some bean curry, some oil, and some special curries. </p>

<p>On one occasion the meal to be given by this householder on the following day had been designated to the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka. Just then that householder went to the monastery on some business. He approached Dabba, bowed, and sat down. And Dabba instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. After the talk, he asked Dabba, “Sir, who has been designated to receive tomorrow’s meal in our house?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Mettiya and Bhūmajaka.” </p>

<hr>

<p>He was disappointed, and thought, “Why should bad monks eat in our house?” After returning to his house, he told a female slave, “For those who are coming for tomorrow’s meal, prepare seats in the gatehouse and serve them broken rice and porridge.” </p>

<p>“Yes, sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>The monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to each other, “Yesterday we were designated a meal from that householder who offers fine food. Tomorrow he’ll serve us together with his wives and children. Some of them will offer us rice, some bean curry, some oil, and some special curries.” And because they were excited, they did not sleep properly that night. </p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>The following morning they robed up, took their bowls and robes, and went to the house of that householder. When the female slave saw them coming, she prepared seats in the gatehouse and said to them, “Please sit, Venerables.” </p>

<hr>

<p>They thought, “The meal can’t be ready, since we’re given seats in the gatehouse.” </p>

<p>She then brought them broken rice and porridge, and said, “Eat, Sirs.” </p>

<p>“But, Sister, we’ve come for the regular meal.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“I know. But yesterday I was told by the head of the household to serve you like this. Please eat.” </p>

<p>They said to each other, “Yesterday this householder came to the monastery and spoke with Dabba. Dabba must be responsible for this split between the householder and us.” And because they were dejected, they did not eat as much as they had intended. When they had eaten their meal and returned from alms round, they put their bowls and robes away, and squatted on their heels outside the monastery gatehouse, using their upper robes as a back-and-knee strap. They were silent and humiliated, their shoulders drooping and their heads down, glum and speechless. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>Just then the nun Mettiyā came to them and said, “My respectful greetings to you, Venerables.” But they did not respond. A second time and a third time she said the same thing, but they still did not respond. </p>

<hr>

<p>“Have I done something wrong? Why don’t you respond?” </p>

<p>“It’s because we’ve been badly treated by Dabba the Mallian, and you’re not taking an interest.” </p>

<p>“But what can I do?” </p>

<p>“If you like, you could make the Buddha expel Dabba.” </p>

<p>“And how can I do that?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Go to the Buddha and say, ‘Venerable Sir, this isn’t proper or appropriate. There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist. From where one would expect security, there’s insecurity. It’s as if water is burning. Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped me.’” </p>

<p>Saying, “Alright, Venerables,” she went to the Buddha, bowed, and then repeated what she had been told to say. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Dabba: “Dabba, do you remember doing as the nun Mettiyā says?” </p>

<p>“Venerable Sir, you know what I’m like.” </p>

<hr>

<p>A second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question and got the same response. He then said, “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers. If it was done by you, say so; if it wasn’t, then say that.” </p>

<p>“Since I was born, Sir, I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, let alone when awake.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha addressed the monks: “Well then, monks, expel the nun Mettiyā, and call these monks to account.” The Buddha then got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. </p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>When the monks had expelled the nun Mettiyā, the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka said to them, “Don’t expel the nun Mettiyā; she’s done nothing wrong. She was urged on by us. We were angry and displeased, and trying to get Dabba to leave the monastic life.” </p>

<p>“But did you groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion?” </p>

<p>“Yes.” </p>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka groundlessly charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>They rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned those monks:</p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">18</span>‘If a monk who is angry and displeased groundlessly charges a monk with an offense entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life, and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the legal issue is groundless, and he admits to his ill will, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” </p>
