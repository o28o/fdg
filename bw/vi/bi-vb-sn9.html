<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka were descending from the Vulture Peak when they saw two goats copulating. They said to each other, “Let’s give the he-goat the name Dabba the Mallian and the she-goat the name Mettiyā the nun. We can then say, ‘Previously we spoke of what we had heard, but now we’ve seen Dabba copulating with the nun Mettiyā.’” They then gave them those names and told the monks, “Previously we spoke of what we had heard, but now we’ve seen Dabba copulating with the nun Mettiyā.” </p>

<p>The monks replied, “Don’t say such things. Venerable Dabba wouldn’t do that.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>The monks told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Dabba: “Dabba, do you remember doing as these monks say?” </p>

<p>“Venerable Sir, you know what I’m like.” </p>

<hr>

<p>A second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question and got the same response. </p>

<hr>

<p>He then said: “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers. If it was done by you, say so; if it wasn’t done by you, then say that.” </p>

<p>“Since I was born, Sir, I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, let alone when awake.” </p>

<p>“Well then, monks, call those monks to account.” And the Buddha got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. </p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>The monks then questioned Mettiya and Bhūmajaka, who told them what had happened. The monks said, “So did you charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Yes.” </p>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them, “How could Mettiya and Bhūmajaka charge Venerable Dabba with an offense entailing expulsion, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>They rebuked those monks in many ways and then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned those monks: “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">5</span>‘If a monk who is angry and displeased, uses an unrelated legal issue as a pretext to charge a monk with an offense entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life, and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the legal issue is unrelated and was used as a pretext, and he admits to his ill will, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p><span class="parno">6</span><strong>A: </strong> whoever … <strong>Monk: </strong> … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span><strong>A monk: </strong> another monk. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">8</span><strong>Angry: </strong> upset, dissatisfied, discontent, having hatred, hostile. </p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span><strong>Displeased: </strong> because of that upset, that ill will, that dissatisfaction, and that discontent, he is displeased. </p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10</span><strong>An unrelated legal issue: </strong> How is a legal issue unrelated to a legal issue? </p>

<p>A legal issue arising from a dispute is unrelated to a legal issue arising from an accusation, a legal issue arising from an offense, and a legal issue arising from business. A legal issue arising from an accusation is unrelated to a legal issue arising from an offense, a legal issue arising from business, and a legal issue arising from a dispute. A legal issue arising from an offense is unrelated to a legal issue arising from business, a legal issue arising from a dispute, and a legal issue arising from an accusation. A legal issue arising from business is unrelated to a legal issue arising from a dispute, a legal issue arising from an accusation, and a legal issue arising from an offense. It is in this way that a legal issue is unrelated to a legal issue. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>How is a legal issue related to a legal issue? A legal issue arising from a dispute is related to a legal issue arising from a dispute. A legal issue arising from an accusation is related to a legal issue arising from an accusation. A legal issue arising from an offense may be either related or unrelated to a legal issue arising from an offense. </p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>How is a legal issue arising from an offense unrelated to a legal issue arising from an offense? An offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a superhuman quality. An offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a superhuman quality, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse. An offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a superhuman quality, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing. An offense entailing expulsion in regard to a superhuman quality is unrelated to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to sexual intercourse, an offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing, and an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being. It is in this way that a legal issue arising from an offense is unrelated to a legal issue arising from an offense. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>How is a legal issue arising from an offense related to a legal issue arising from an offense?

An offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing is related to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to stealing. An offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being is related to an offense entailing expulsion in regard to a human being.

<h4>Permutations  </h4>

<h5>Doing the accusing oneself </h5>

<p><span class="parno">37</span>A monk sees a second monk committing an offense entailing suspension, and the first monk regards it as an offense entailing suspension.
