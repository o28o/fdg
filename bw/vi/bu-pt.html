<p class="endsutta ital">Honour to the Blessed One, the Perfected One, the fully Enlightened One.</p>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Sweeping the place, lighting the lamp there, setting out water and arranging places to sit; these (four) are called the procedures to be done prior to the performance of the Uposatha.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Conveying consent, conveying purity, announcing the season, announcing the number of bhikkhus, and appointing a bhikkhu to admonish bhikkhunis; these (five) are called the preliminary duties of the Uposatha.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>If it is an Uposatha Day, all bhikkhus present within a boundary (sima) are within arms reach, they have not committed the same offence, and there is no person who is ineligible within arms reach then these (four) are called "readiness to perform Uposatha".</p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Having completed the procedures and preliminary duties and confessed any offences that have been committed then with the permission of a united Saṅgha we will now proceed to recite the Pāṭimokkha.</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Venerables, I ask the saṅgha to listen to me. Today is the observance day, the fifteenth/fourteenth. If it seems appropriate to the saṅgha, it should perform the observance-day ceremony, it should recite the Pāṭimokkha.</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>What is the preliminary duty of the saṅgha? The Venerables should declare purity, and I will recite the Pāṭimokkha. Everyone present should listen and attend carefully. Anyone who has committed an offense should reveal it. If you have not committed an offense, you should remain silent. If you are silent, I will regard you as pure. Just as one who is asked individually responds, so too, the announcement is made up to three times in this kind of assembly: if a monk remembers an offense but does not reveal it when an announcement is made up to the third time, he is lying in full awareness. And lying in full awareness is called an obstacle by the Master. A monk who remembers an offense and who is seeking purification should therefore reveal it. When it is revealed, he will be at ease.</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Venerable Sirs, the introduction has been recited. In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.</p>

<p class="endsection">The introduction is finished.</p>

<h3>Pārājika: Rules entailing expulsion from the Saṅgha (Defeat) <a id="pr" class="back" href="#top" title="Go to top of page"></a></h3>

<p>Now, Venerables, the four rules entailing expulsion come up for recitation.</p>

<p id="pr-1"><span class="parno">1</span>If a monk, after taking on the monks’ training and way of life, without first renouncing the training and revealing his weakness, has sexual intercourse, even with a female animal, he is expelled and excluded from the community.</p>

<p id="pr-2"><span class="parno">2</span>If a monk, intending to steal, takes from a village or from the wilderness what has not been given to him—the sort of theft for which kings, having caught a thief, would beat, imprison, or banish him, saying: “You’re a bandit, you’re a fool, you’ve gone astray, you’re a thief”— he too is expelled and excluded from the community.</p>

<p id="pr-3"><span class="parno">3</span>If a monk intentionally kills a human being or seeks an instrument of death for him or praises death or incites someone to die, saying: “Good man, what’s the point of this wretched and difficult life? Death is better for you than life!”— thinking and intending thus, if he praises death in various ways or incites someone to die—he too is expelled and excluded from the community.</p>

<p id="pr-4"><span class="parno">4</span>If a monk falsely claims for himself a superhuman quality, knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones, saying: “This I know, this I see,” but after some time—whether he is questioned or not, but having committed the offense and desiring purification—should say: “Not knowing I said that I know, not seeing that I see; what I said was empty and false,” unless it is due to overestimation, he too is expelled and excluded from the community.</p>

<p>Venerables, the four rules entailing expulsion have been recited. If a monk commits any of them, he is no longer part of the community of monks. As before, so after: he is expelled and excluded from the community.</p>

<p>In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.</p>

<p class="endsection">The rules entailing expulsion are finished.</p>

<h3>Saṅghādisesa: Rules entailing an initial and subsequent meeting of the Saṅgha <a id="sg" class="back" href="#top" title="Go to top of page"></a></h3>

<p>Now, Venerables, the thirteen rules entailing suspension come up for recitation.</p>

<p id="sg-1"><span class="parno">1</span>Intentional emission of semen, except while dreaming, is an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-2"><span class="parno">2</span>If a lustful monk makes physical contact with a woman—holding her hand or hair, or touching any part of her body—he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-3"><span class="parno">3</span>If a lustful monk speaks lewd words connected with sexual intercourse to a woman, as a young man might to a young woman, he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-4"><span class="parno">4</span>If a lustful monk encourages a woman to satisfy his own needs: “Sister, she provides the highest service who in this way satisfies one like me, who is virtuous, celibate, and of good character,” and if it is a reference to sexual intercourse, he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-5"><span class="parno">5</span>If a monk mediates a man’s intentions to a woman or a woman’s intentions to a man, for marriage or for an affair, even if just a brief one, he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-6"><span class="parno">6</span>When a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut without a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, it is to be no more than 3 meters long and 1.75 meters wide inside. He must get monks to approve a site where no harm will be done and which has a space on all sides. If a monk, by means of begging, builds a hut on a site where harm will be done and which lacks a space on all sides, or he does not get monks to approve the site, or he exceeds the size limit, he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-7"><span class="parno">7</span>When a monk builds a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, he must get monks to approve a site where no harm will be done and which has a space on all sides. If a monk builds a large dwelling on a site where harm will be done and which lacks a space on all sides, or he does not get monks to approve the site, he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-8"><span class="parno">8</span>If a monk who is angry and displeased groundlessly accuses another monk of an offense entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life, and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the legal issue is groundless, and he admits to his ill-will, he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-9"><span class="parno">9</span>If a monk who is angry and displeased, using an unrelated legal issue as a pretext, accuses another monk of an offense entailing expulsion, aiming to make him leave the monastic life, and then after some time, whether he is questioned or not, it is clear that the legal issue is unrelated and used as a pretext, and he admits to his ill-will, he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-10"><span class="parno">10</span>If a monk pursues schism in a united Saṅgha or persists in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism, the monks should say to him: “Venerable, don’t pursue schism in the united Saṅgha or persist in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism, for a united Saṅgha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—lives in comfort.” If that monk still continues as before, the monks should admonish him up to three times to make him stop. If he then stops, that is good. If not, he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-11"><span class="parno">11</span>That monk may have one, two, or three monks who take his side and support him, and they may say: “Venerables, don’t correct this monk. He speaks in accordance with the Teaching and the training. And he speaks with our consent and approval. He knows about us and speaks for us, and we agree to this.” The monks should say to those monks: “Venerables, don’t say that. This monk does not speak in accordance with the Teaching or the training. Don’t consent to schism in the Saṅgha. Stay with the Saṅgha, for a united Saṅgha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—lives in comfort.” If those monks still continue as before, the monks should admonish them up to three times to make them stop. If they then stop, that is good. If not, they commit an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-12"><span class="parno">12</span>If a monk is difficult to correct, and he makes himself incorrigible when he is legitimately corrected by the monks concerning the training rules that are recited, saying: “Venerables, don’t say anything to me, either positive or negative, and I won’t say anything to you, either positive or negative; please refrain from correcting me,” then the monks should correct him in this way: “Venerable, be easy to correct, not incorrigible. And please give legitimate correction to the monks, and the monks will do the same to you. For it’s in this way that the Master’s community has grown, that is, through mutual correction and mutual rehabilitation.” If that monk still continues as before, the monks should admonish him up to three times to make him stop. If he then stops, that is good. If not, he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p id="sg-13"><span class="parno">13</span>If a monk who lives supported by a village or town is a corrupter of families and badly behaved, and his bad behavior is seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by him are seen and heard about, then the monks should correct him in this way: “Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved. Your bad behavior is seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you are seen and heard about. Leave this monastery; you have stayed here long enough.” If he replies: “You’re acting out of desire, ill-will, confusion, and fear; because of this sort of offense, you banish some, but not others,” the monks should correct him in this way: “Venerable, don’t say that. The monks are not acting out of desire, ill-will, confusion, and fear. Venerable, you’re a corrupter of families and badly behaved. Your bad behavior is seen and heard about, and the families corrupted by you are seen and heard about. Venerable, leave this monastery; you have stayed here long enough.” If that monk still continues as before, the monks should admonish him up to three times to make him stop. If he then stops, that is good. If not, he commits an offense entailing suspension.</p>

<p>Venerables, the thirteen rules entailing suspension have been recited, nine being immediate offenses, four after the third announcement. If a monk commits any one of them, he is to undergo probation for the same number of days as he knowingly concealed that offense. When this is completed, he must be on trial for a further six days. When this is completed, he is to be rehabilitated wherever there is an Saṅgha of at least twenty monks. If that monk is rehabilitated by an Saṅgha of even one less than twenty, that monk is not rehabilitated and those monks are at fault. This is the proper procedure.</p>

<p>In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.</p>

<p class="endsection">The rules entailing suspension are finished.</p>

<h3 id="ay">Aniyata: Indefinite rules</h3>

<p>Now, Venerables, the two undetermined rules come up for recitation.</p>

<p id="an1"><span class="parno">1</span>If a monk sits alone with a woman on a private and concealed seat suitable for doing it, and a trustworthy female lay follower sees him and accuses him of an offense entailing expulsion or an offense entailing suspension or an offense entailing confession, then, if he admits to the sitting, he is to be dealt with according to one of these three or according to what that trustworthy female lay follower has said. This rule is undetermined.</p>

<p id="an2"><span class="parno">2</span>Although a seat is not concealed, nor suitable for doing it, it may be suitable for speaking lewdly to a woman. If a monk sits alone with a woman in private on such a seat, and a trustworthy female lay follower sees him and accuses him of an offense entailing suspension or an offense entailing confession, then, if he admits to the sitting, he is be dealt with according to one of these two or according to what that trustworthy female lay follower has said. This rule too is undetermined.</p>

<hr>
<p>Venerables, the two undetermined rules have been recited.</p>

<p>In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?</p>

<p>You are pure in this and therefore silent. I will remember it thus.</p>

<p class="endsection">The undetermined rules are finished.</p>

<p>Now, Venerables, the thirty rules entailing relinquishment and confession come up for recitation.</p>

<h3>Nissaggiya Pācittiya: Rules entailing forfeiture and confession</h3>

<h4 id="np-part1">Part One: The Robe-cloth Chapter</h4>

<p id="np-1"><span class="parno">1</span>When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, a monk should keep an extra robe(-cloth) for ten days at the most. If he keeps it beyond that, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>

<p id="np-2"><span class="parno">2</span>When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, if a monk stays apart from his three robes even for a single day, except if the monks have agreed, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>

<p id="np-3"><span class="parno">3</span>When his robe is finished and the robe-making season has ended, if out-of-season robe-cloth becomes available to a monk, he may receive it if he wishes. If he receives it, he should quickly make a robe. If there is not enough cloth, but he is expecting more, he should keep it at most one month to make up the lack. If he keeps it beyond that, even if he expects more cloth, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession.</p>
