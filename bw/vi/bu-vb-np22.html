<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu. At that time a potter had invited the monks, saying, “If any of you needs an almsbowl, I’ll provide it.” But the monks had no sense of moderation, and they asked for many bowls. Those who had small bowls asked for large ones, and those who had large bowls asked for small ones. The potter was so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make goods for sale. He could not make a living for himself, and his wives and children suffered. People complained and criticized them, “How can the Sakyan monastics have no sense of moderation and ask for many bowls? This potter is so busy making bowls for them that he is unable to make goods for sale. He is unable to make a living for himself, and his wives and children are suffering.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can those monks have no sense of moderation and ask for many bowls?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that there are monks who do this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … “How can those foolish men do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … After rebuking them, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“Monks, a monk should not ask for an almsbowl. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>Soon afterwards the bowl of a certain monk broke. Knowing that the Buddha had prohibited asking for a bowl and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not ask for a new one. As a consequence, he collected almsfood with his hands. People complained and criticized him, “How can the Sakyan monastics collect almsfood with their hands, just like the monastics of other religions?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“Monks, I allow you to ask for a new almsbowl if your bowl has been lost or is broken.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>When they heard about the Buddha’s allowance, the monks from the group of six asked for many bowls even when their existing bowls only had a minor chip or scratch. Once again that potter was so busy making bowls for the monks that he was unable to make goods for sale. He could not make a living for himself, and his wives and children suffered. And people complained and criticized them as before. </p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks, “How can the monks from the group of six ask for many bowls even when their existing bowls only has a minor chip or scratch?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you do this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … “Foolish men, how could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">9</span>‘If a monk exchanges an almsbowl with fewer than five mends for a new almsbowl, he commits an offense entailing relinquishment and confession. That monk should relinquish that almsbowl to a gathering of monks. He should then be given the last almsbowl belonging to that gathering: “Monk, this bowl is yours. Keep it until it breaks.” This is the proper procedure.’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p><span class="parno">10</span><strong>A: </strong> whoever … <strong>Monk: </strong> … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span><strong>An almsbowl with fewer than five mends: </strong> it has no mends, one mend, two mends, three mends, or four mends. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>An almsbowl with a mend that does not count: </strong> one that does not have a fracture of 3.5 cm. </p>

<p><strong>An almsbowl with a mend that counts: </strong> one that does have a fracture of 3.5 cm. </p>

<p><strong>New almsbowl: </strong> asked for is what is meant. </p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span><strong>Exchanges: </strong> If he asks, then for the effort there is an act of wrong conduct. When he gets the bowl, it becomes subject to relinquishment. </p>


<hr>

<p>It should be relinquished in the midst of the Sangha. All determined bowls should be brought together. One should not determine an inferior bowl, thinking, “I’ll get a valuable one.” </p>

<p class="rule">If one determines an inferior bowl, thinking, “I’ll get a valuable one,” one commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p>“And, monks, it should be relinquished like this. After approaching the Sangha, that monk should arrange his upper robe over one shoulder and pay respect at the feet of the senior monks. He should then squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, </p>

<p>‘Venerables, this almsbowl, which I got in exchange for a bowl that had fewer than five mends, is to be relinquished. I relinquish it to the Sangha.’” </p>

<p>After relinquishing it, he should confess the offense. The confession should be received by a competent and capable monk. </p>

<hr>

<p>A monk who has five qualities should be appointed as the distributor of almsbowls: one who is not biased by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and who knows what has and has not been distributed. “And, monks, this is how he should be appointed. First the monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: </p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, it should appoint monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls. This is the motion. </p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The Sangha appoints monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls. Any monk who agrees to appointing monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t agree should speak up. </p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so as the distributor of almsbowls. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">16</span>The appointed monk should give away that relinquished bowl. He should tell the most senior monk, “Sir, would you like this bowl?” If the most senior monk takes it, his old bowl should be offered to the next monk. </p>

<p class="rule">He should not not take that bowl out of sympathy. If he does, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p>It is not to be offered to anyone who does not have bowl. In this manner it should be offered all the way to the most junior monk in the Sangha. </p>

<p>He should then be given the last almsbowl belonging to that gathering: “Monk, this bowl is yours. Keep it until it breaks”: </p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>That monk is not to store that bowl in an unsuitable place, use it in an unsuitable way, or give it away, thinking, “How may this bowl be lost, destroyed, or broken?” If he stores it in an unsuitable place, uses it in an unsuitable way, or gives it away, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><strong>This is the proper procedure: </strong> this is the right method. </p>
