<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time in Sāvatthī there was a family where both the husband and the wife had confidence. They were growing in faith, but declining in wealth. Whatever food they had in the morning, they gave to the monks. Sometimes they went without food. People complained and criticized the monks:</p>

<p>“How can the Sakyan monastics not have a sense of moderation in receiving offerings? After giving to them, these people sometimes go without.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p>Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“Monks, if a family’s faith is growing, but its wealth is declining, I allow you to designate it as ‘in training’, through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement. </p>

<p>And the designation should be given like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: </p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. Such-and-such a family is growing in faith, but declining in wealth. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should designate that family as “in training”. This is the motion. </p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. Such-and-such a family is growing in faith, but declining in wealth. The Sangha designates that family as “in training”. Any monk who approves of designating that family as “in training” should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>The Sangha has designated such-and-such a family as “in training”. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>“And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">7</span>‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. </p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>Soon afterwards there was a celebration in Sāvatthī and people invited the monks for a meal. And so did the family that had been designated as in training. 

But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited eating fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, and being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept. That family complained and criticized them, “What is it with us that they don’t receive from us?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“Monks, if you have been invited, I allow you to eat fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from a family designated as in training. </p>

<p>And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">11</span>‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk, without first being invited, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. </p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>Soon afterwards a certain monk was associating with that family. One morning he robed up, took his bowl and robe, went to them, and sat down on the prepared seat. Just then that monk was sick, and so they invited him to eat. 

But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited an uninvited monk from eating fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept. And being unable to walk for alms, he missed his meal. </p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>He then returned to the monastery and told the monks what had happened, who in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“Monks, I allow a sick monk to eat fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from a family designated as in training. </p>

<p>And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">15</span>‘There are families that are designated as “in training”. If a monk, without being sick and without first being invited, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from such a family, he must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p><span class="parno">16</span><strong>There are families that are designated as “in training”: </strong> a family designated as in training: a family in which the faith is growing but the wealth is declining. Such a family is designated as “in training” through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and one announcement. </p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span><strong>A: </strong> whoever … <strong>Monk: </strong> … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><strong>Such a family: </strong> that kind of family. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">19</span><strong>Without being invited: </strong> without being invited for the same or the following day. If the invitation is made when he has entered the vicinity of the house, this is called “without being invited”. </p>

<p><span class="parno">20</span><strong>Invited: </strong> invited for the same or the following day. If the invitation is made when he has not entered the vicinity of the house, this is called “invited”. </p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span><strong>Without being sick: </strong> who is able to walk for alms. </p>

<p><span class="parno">22</span><strong>Sick: </strong> who is unable to walk for alms. </p>

<p><span class="parno">23</span><strong>Fresh food: </strong> apart from the five cooked foods, the post-midday tonics, the seven-day tonics, and the lifetime tonics—the rest is called “fresh food”. </p>

<p><span class="parno">24</span><strong>Cooked food: </strong> there are five kinds of cooked food: cooked grain, porridge, flour  products, fish, and meat. </p>

<p><span class="parno">25</span>If, without being sick and without being invited, he receives fresh or cooked food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. </p>

<h3>Permutations </h3>

<p><span class="parno">26</span>If a family is designated as in training, and he perceives it as such, and he, without being sick and without being invited, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from that family, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. If a family is designated as in training, but he is unsure of it, and he, without being sick and without being invited, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from that family, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. If a family is designated as in training, but he does not perceive it as such, and he, without being sick and without being invited, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it from that family, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. </p>

<p><span class="parno">27</span>If he receives post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics for the purpose of food, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. For every mouthful, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If a family is not designated as in training, but he perceives it as such, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If a family is not designated as in training, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If a family is not designated as in training, and he does not perceive it as such, there is no offense. </p>

<h3>Non-offenses </h3>

<p><span class="parno">28</span>There is no offense: if he has been invited; if he is sick; if he eats the leftovers from one who has been invited or who is sick; if other people’s almsfood is prepared there; if they give after coming out from the house; if it is a regular meal invitation; if it is a meal for which lots are drawn; if it is a half-monthly meal; if it is on the observance day; if it is on the day after the observance day; if the family gives post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics, saying, “Use these when there’s a reason;” if he is insane; if he is the first offender. </p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">29</span>The third training rule on acknowledgment is finished. </p>
