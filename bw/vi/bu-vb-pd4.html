<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying in the Sakyan country in the Banyan Tree Monastery at Kapilavatthu, the slaves of the Sakyans were rebelling. The Sakyan women wished to prepare a meal at the wilderness dwellings, but the slaves heard about this 

and infested the path. When the Sakyan women took various kinds of fine food and set out for a wilderness dwelling, the slaves emerged, and they robbed and raped those Sakyan women. Soon afterwards the Sakyan men came out, and they got hold of those criminals together with their loot. They then complained and criticized the monks:</p>

<p>“How could they not inform that there are criminals staying near the monastery?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>The monks heard the complaints of the Sakyans and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, monks, I will lay down a training rule for the following ten reasons: for the well-being of the Sangha, for the comfort of the Sangha, for the restraint of bad people, for the ease of well-behaved monks, for the restraint of corruptions relating to the present life, for the restraint of corruptions relating to future lives, to give rise to confidence in those without it, to increase the confidence of those who have it, for the longevity of the true Teaching, and for supporting the training. And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">3</span>‘There are wilderness dwellings that are considered risky and dangerous. If a monk, without first making an announcement about those dwellings, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, he must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. </p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>Soon afterwards a monk in a wilderness dwelling was sick. People took fresh or cooked food and went to that wilderness dwelling, and they invited that monk to eat. 

But knowing that the Buddha had prohibited the eating of fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it at a wilderness dwelling, and being afraid of wrongdoing, he did not accept it. And being unable to walk for alms, he missed his meal. </p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>He then told the monks what had happened, and they in turn told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“Monks, I allow a sick monk, without first making an announcement, to eat fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it at a wilderness dwelling. </p>

<p>And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">7</span>‘There are wilderness dwellings that are considered risky and dangerous. If a monk who is not sick, without first making an announcement about those dwellings, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, he must acknowledge it: “I have done a blameworthy and unsuitable thing that is to be acknowledged. I acknowledge it.”’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p><span class="parno">8</span><strong>There are wilderness dwellings: </strong> a wilderness dwelling: if it is at least 800 meters away from any inhabited area. </p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span><strong>Risky: </strong> in the monastery, or in the vicinity of the monastery, criminals have been seen camped, eating, standing, sitting, or lying down. </p>

<p><span class="parno">10</span><strong>Dangerous: </strong> in the monastery, or in the vicinity of the monastery, criminals have been seen injuring, robbing, or beating people. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span><strong>A: </strong> whoever … <strong>Monk: </strong> … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">12</span><strong>About those dwellings: </strong> about such kinds of dwellings. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">13</span><strong>Without making an announcement: </strong> if an announcement is made to any of one’s five co-monastics, this is called “without making an announcement”. If an announcement is made about anything apart from the monastery or its vicinity, this is called “without making an announcement”. </p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span><strong>Making an announcement: </strong> if a woman or a man comes to the monastery or the vicinity of the monastery and says, “Venerable, they’ll bring so-and-so’s fresh or cooked food,” then, if it is risky, this should be declared, and if it is dangerous, that should be declared. If the person says, “Never mind, it will be brought,” then the criminals are to be told, “People are coming here; go away.” </p>

<p>When an announcement has been made in regard to congee, and accompanying food is brought, this is called “announced”. When an announcement has been made in regard to rice, and accompanying food is brought, this is called “announced”. When an announcement has been made in regard to fresh food, and accompanying food is brought, this is called “announced”. When an announcement has been made in regard to a particular family, then when any person from that family brings fresh or cooked food, this is called “announced”. When an announcement has been made in regard to a particular village, then when any person from that village brings fresh or cooked food, this is called “announced”. When an announcement has been made in regard to a particular association, then when any person from that association brings fresh or cooked food, this is called “announced”. </p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span><strong>Fresh food: </strong> apart from the five cooked foods, the post-midday tonics, the seven-day tonics, and the lifetime tonics—the rest is called “fresh food”. </p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span><strong>Cooked food: </strong> there are five kinds of cooked food: cooked grain, porridge, flour products, fish, and meat. </p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span><strong>Inside that monastery: </strong> if the monastery is enclosed, then within the enclosure. If the monastery is unenclosed, then in the vicinity. </p>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><strong>Who is not sick: </strong> who is able to walk for alms. </p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span><strong>Who is sick: </strong> who is unable to walk for alms. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>If, without making an announcement, one who is not sick receives fresh or cooked food with the intention of eating it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. For every mouthful, he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. </p>

<h3>Permutations </h3>

<p><span class="parno">21</span>If there has been no announcement, and he does not perceive that there has, and he, not being sick, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. If there has been no announcement, but he is unsure of it, and he, not being sick, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. If there has been no announcement, but he perceives that there has, and he, not being sick, eats fresh or cooked food after personally receiving it inside that monastery, then he commits an offense entailing acknowledgment. </p>

<p><span class="parno">22</span>If he receives post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics for the purpose of food, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. For every mouthful, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there has been an announcement, but he does not perceive that there has, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there has been an announcement, but he is unsure of it, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. If there has been an announcement, and he perceives that there has, there is no offense. </p>

<h3>Non-offenses </h3>

<p><span class="parno">23</span>There is no offense: if there has been an announcement; if he is sick; if he eats the leftovers from where there has been an announcement or from one who is sick; if he receives the food outside the monastery and then eats it inside; if he eats a root, bark, a leaf, a flower, or a fruit originating in that monastery; if, when there is a reason, he uses post-midday tonics, seven-day tonics, or lifetime tonics; if he is insane; if he is the first offender. </p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">24</span>The fourth training rule entailing acknowledgment is finished. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">25</span>“Venerables, the four rules on acknowledgment have been recited. In regard to this I ask you, ‘Are you pure in this?’ A second time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ A third time I ask, ‘Are you pure in this?’ You are pure in this and therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.” </p>
