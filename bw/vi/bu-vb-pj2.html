<h3>Origin story</h3>
<h4>First sub-story</h4>
</div>
<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak. At that time a number of monks who were friends had made grass huts on the slope of Mount Isigili and had entered the rainy-season residence there. Among them was Venerable Dhaniya the potter. When the three months were over and they had completed the rainy-season residence, the monks demolished their grass huts, put away the grass and sticks, and left to wander the country. But Venerable Dhaniya spent the winter and the summer right  there. </p>

<p>Then, on one occasion, while Dhaniya was in the village to collect almsfood, some women gathering grass and firewood demolished his grass hut and took away the grass and sticks. A second time Dhaniya collected grass and sticks and made a grass hut, and again the hut was demolished in the same way. The same thing happened a third time. 
</p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>Dhaniya thought, “Three times this has happened. But I’m well-trained and experienced in my own craft of pottery. Why don’t I knead mud myself and make a hut entirely of clay?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>And he did just that. He then collected grass, sticks, and cow-dung, and he baked his hut. It was a pretty and attractive little hut, red in color like a scarlet rain-mite. And when struck, it sounded just like a bell. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha was descending from the Vulture Peak with a number of monks when he saw that hut. He said to the monks: </p>

<p>“What’s this pretty and attractive thing that’s red in color like a scarlet rain-mite?” </p>

<hr>

<p>The monks told the Buddha, who then rebuked Dhaniya: </p>

<p>“It’s not suitable for that foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could he make a hut entirely of clay? Doesn’t he have any consideration, compassion, and mercy for living beings? Go, monks, and demolish this hut, so that future generations don’t follow his example. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">And, monks, you shouldn’t make a hut entirely of clay. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p>Saying, “Yes, Sir,” they went to demolish it. </p>

<p>And Dhaniya said to them: “Why are you demolishing my hut?” </p>

<p>“The Buddha has asked us to.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Demolish it then, if the Lord of the Truth has said so.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>Dhaniya thought, “Three times, while I was in the village to collect almsfood, women gathering grass and firewood demolished my hut and took away the grass and sticks. And now my hut made entirely of clay has been demolished at the Buddha’s request. Now, the caretaker of the woodyard is a friend of mine. Why don’t I ask him for timber and make a hut out of that?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>Dhaniya then went to the caretaker of the woodyard and told him what had happened, adding, “Please give me some timber, I want to make a wooden hut.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“There’s no timber, Sir, that I could give you. This timber is held by the King. It’s meant for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency. You can only have it if the King gives it away.” </p>

<p>“Actually, it’s been given by the King.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">7</span>The caretaker of the woodyard thought, “These Sakyan monastics have integrity. They are celibate and their conduct is good, and they are truthful, moral, and have a good character. Even the King has faith in them. These venerables wouldn’t say something is given if it wasn’t.” And he said to Dhaniya, “You may take it, Sir.” Dhaniya then had that timber cut into pieces, took it away on carts, and made a wooden hut. </p>

<p><span class="parno">8</span>Soon afterwards the brahmin Vassakāra, the chief minister of Magadha, was inspecting the public works in Rājagaha when he went to the caretaker of the woodyard and said, “What’s going on? Where’s the timber held by the King that’s meant for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency?” </p>

<p>“The King has given it to Venerable Dhaniya.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">9</span>Vassakāra was upset and thought, “How could the King give away this timber to Dhaniya the potter?” </p>

<p>He then went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and said, “Is it true, sir, that you have given away  to Dhaniya the potter the timber that was held for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Who said that?” </p>

<p>“The caretaker of the woodyard.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, brahmin, summon the caretaker of the woodyard.” And Vassakāra had the caretaker of the woodyard bound and taken by force. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10</span>Dhaniya saw this and said to him, “Why is this happening to you?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Because of the timber, Sir.” </p>

<p>“Go then, and I’ll come too.” </p>

<p>“Please come before I’m done for.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span>Dhaniya then went to King Bimbisāra’s house and sat down on the prepared seat. The King approached Dhaniya, bowed, sat down, and said: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Is it true, Venerable, that I have given to you the timber held for repairs of the town and put aside in case of an emergency” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Yes, great king.” </p>

<p>“We kings are very busy—we may give and not remember. Please remind me.” </p>

<p>“Do you remember, great king, when you were first anointed, speaking these words: ‘I give the grass, sticks, and water for the monastics and brahmins to enjoy’?” </p>

<p>“I remember. There are monastics and brahmins who have a sense of conscience, who are afraid of wrongdoing and fond of the training. They are afraid of wrongdoing even in regard to small matters. When I spoke, I was referring to them, and it concerned what’s ownerless in the wilderness. Yet you imagine that you can take timber not given to you by means of this pretext? Even so, I cannot beat, imprison, or banish a monastic or brahmin living in my own kingdom. Go, you’re free because of your status, but don’t do such a thing again.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">12</span>But people complained and criticized him: “These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. They claim to have integrity, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and good. But they don’t have the good character of a monastic or a brahmin. They’ve lost the plot! They even deceive the King, never mind other people.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people. The monks of few desires, who had a sense of conscience, and who were contented, afraid of wrongdoing, and fond of the training, complained and criticized Venerable Dhaniya, “How could he take the King’s timber without it being given to him?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>After rebuking Dhaniya in many ways, they told the Buddha. The Buddha then had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned Venerable Dhaniya: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Is it true, Dhaniya, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence and cause some to lose it.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span>Just then a former judge who had gone forth with the monks was sitting near the Buddha. The Buddha said to him, “For stealing how much does King Bimbisāra beat, imprison, or banish a thief?” </p>

<p>“For stealing a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i> coin, Sir, or the value of a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i>.” At that time in Rājagaha a <i lang="pi" translate="no">pāda</i> coin was worth five <i lang="pi" translate="no">māsaka</i> coins. </p>

<hr>

<p>After rebuking Venerable Dhaniya in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">16</span>‘If a monk, intending to steal, takes what has not been given to him—the sort of stealing for which kings, having caught a thief, would beat, imprison, or banish him, saying, “You’re a bandit, you’re a fool, you’ve gone astray, you’re a thief”—he too is expelled and excluded from the community.’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>In this way the Buddha laid down this training rule for the monks. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>At one time the monks from the group of six went to the dyers, stole their stock of cloth, brought it back to the monastery, and shared it out. The other monks said to them, “You have great merit, seeing that you’ve gotten so much robe-cloth.” </p>

<p>“How is it that we have merit? Just now we went to the dyers and stole their cloth.” </p>

<p>“But hasn’t the Buddha laid down a training rule? Why then do you steal the dyers’ cloth?” </p>

<p>“It’s true that the Buddha has laid down a training rule, but it concerns inhabited areas, not the wilderness.” </p>

<p>“But that’s just the same. It’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you steal the dyers’ cloth? This will affect people’s confidence, and cause some to lose it.” </p>

<p>After rebuking those monks in many ways, they told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>The Buddha had the Sangha of monks gathered and questioned those monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them, “It’s not suitable, foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you do this? This will affect people’s confidence, and cause some to lose it.” Then, after rebuking the monks from the group of six in many ways, the Buddha spoke in dispraise of being difficult to support … but he spoke in praise of … being energetic. Having given a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks … “And so, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p>It turned out that the householder’s nephew had faith and confidence, and so Ajjuka assigned the property to him. He then established a household with that wealth and made a gift. </p>

<p>The householder’s son then said to Venerable Ānanda: </p>

He grabbed it, thinking, “I’ll give it to the owners.” But the owners accused him, saying, “You’re not a monastic anymore!” </p>

<p>Just then a woman cowherd who had seen him crossing said, “Come, Sir, have sexual intercourse.” Thinking he was no longer a monastic, he had sexual intercourse with her. When he arrived at Kosambī, he told the monks, who in turn told the Buddha. “There’s no offense entailing expulsion for stealing, but there’s an offense entailing expulsion for having sexual intercourse.” </p>

“But what have you done?” He told him. Venerable Daḷhika had the turban brought and valued. It was worth less than five <i lang="pi" translate="no">māsaka</i> coins. Saying, “There’s no offense entailing expulsion,” he gave a teaching. And that monk was delighted. </p>
