<h2>Origin story </h2>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, Devadatta went to Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta. He said to them, “Let’s cause a schism in the Sangha of the ascetic Gotama. Let’s break its authority.” </p>

<p>Kokālika said to Devadatta, “The ascetic Gotama is powerful and mighty. How can we do this?” </p>

<p>“Well, let’s go to the ascetic Gotama and request five things: ‘In many ways, Venerable Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, being inspiring, the reduction in things, and being energetic. And there are five things that lead to just that: It would be good, Sir, </p>

<hr>

<p>If the monks stayed in the wilderness for life, and whoever stayed near an inhabited area would commit an offense </p>

<p>If they ate only almsfood for life, and whoever accepted an invitational meal would commit an offense </p>

<p>If they were rag-robe wearers for life, and whoever accepted robe-cloth from a householder would commit an offense </p>

<p>If they lived at the foot of a tree for life, and whoever took shelter would commit an offense </p>

<p>If they didn’t eat fish or meat for life, and whoever did would commit an offense.’ </p>

<p>The ascetic Gotama won’t allow this. We’ll then be able to win people over with these five points.” </p>

<p>Kokālika said, “It might be possible to cause a schism in the Sangha with these five points, for people have confidence in austerity.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>Devadatta and his followers then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down, and Devadatta made his request. The Buddha replied, “No, Devadatta. Those who wish may stay in the wilderness, and those who wish may live near inhabited areas. Those who wish may eat only almsfood, and those who wish may accept invitational meals. Those who wish may be rag-robe wearers, and those who wish may accept robe-cloth from householders. I have allowed the foot of a tree as resting place for eight months of the year, as well as fish and meat that are pure in three respects: one hasn’t seen, heard, or suspected that the animal was specifically killed to feed a monastic.” </p>

<p>Devadatta thought, “The Buddha doesn’t allow the five points.” Glad and elated, he got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left with his followers. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>Devadatta then entered Rājagaha and won people over with the five points, saying, “The ascetic Gotama doesn’t agree to them, but we practice in accordance with them.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>The foolish people with little faith and confidence said, “These Sakyan monastics are practicing asceticism and living with the aim of self-effacement. But the ascetic Gotama is extravagant and has chosen a life of indulgence.” But the wise people who had faith and confidence complained and criticized Devadatta, “How can Devadatta pursue schism in the Sangha of the Buddha? How can he break its authority?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>The monks heard the criticism of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him in the same way. </p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>After rebuking Devadatta in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Devadatta: “Is it true, Devadatta, that you are doing this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how can you do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">7</span>‘If a monk pursues schism in a united Sangha or persists in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism, the monks should correct him like this, “Venerable, don’t pursue schism in the united Sangha or persist in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism. Stay with the Sangha, for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—is at ease.” If that monk continues as before, the monks should press him up to three times to make him stop. If he then stops, all is well. If he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” </p>

<h4>Definitions </h4>

<p><span class="parno">8</span><strong>A: </strong> whoever … <strong>Monk</strong>: … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. </p>

<p><span class="parno">9</span><strong>A united Sangha: </strong> those belonging to the same Buddhist sect and staying within the same monastery zone. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">10</span><strong>Pursues schism: </strong> thinking, “What can I do to split, separate, and divide them?” he searches for a faction and puts together a group. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">11</span><strong>A legal issue conducive to schism: </strong> the eighteen bases for schism. </p>


<p><span class="parno">12</span><strong>Taking up: </strong> having adopted. </p>


<p><span class="parno">13</span><strong>Taking up: </strong> he proclaims. </p>


<p><span class="parno">14</span><strong>If he persists in: </strong> if he does not stop. </p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span><strong>Him: </strong> the monk who is pursuing schism in the Sangha. </p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span><strong>The monks: </strong> other monks.

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">17</span>Those who see it or hear it. They should correct him like this: </p>

<p>“Venerable, don’t pursue schism in the united Sangha or persist in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism. Stay with the Sangha, for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—is at ease.” </p>

<p>And they should correct him a second and a third time. If he stops, all is well. If he does not stop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p class="rule">If those who heard about it do not say anything, they commit an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<hr>

<p>That monk, even if he has to be pulled into the Sangha, should be corrected like this: </p>

<p>“Venerable, don’t pursue schism in the united Sangha or persist in taking up a legal issue conducive to schism. Stay with the Sangha, for a united Sangha—in concord, in harmony, having a joint recitation—is at ease.” </p>

<p>They should correct him a second and a third time. If he stops, all is well. If he does not stop, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p>Should press him: </p>

<p>“And, monks, he should be pressed like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">18</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk so-and-so is pursuing schism in the united Sangha. And he keeps on doing it. If it seems appropriate to the Sangha, the Sangha should press him to make him stop. This is the motion. </p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk so-and-so is pursuing schism in the united Sangha. And he keeps on doing it. The Sangha presses him to make him stop. Any monk who approves of pressing him to make him stop should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p><span class="parno">20</span>For the second time I speak on this matter: … For the third time I speak on this matter: Please, Venerables, I ask the Sangha to listen. The monk so-and-so is pursuing schism in the united Sangha. And he keeps on doing it. The Sangha presses him to make him stop. Any monk who approves of pressing him to make him stop should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span>The Sangha has pressed monk so-and-so to make him stop. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” </p>
<hr>

<p><span class="parno">22</span>After the motion, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. After each of the first two announcements, he commits a serious offense. When the last announcement is finished, he commits an offense entailing suspension. For one who commits the offense entailing suspension, the offense of wrong conduct and the serious offenses are annulled. </p>

<p><span class="parno">23</span><strong>He commits an offense entailing suspension: </strong> … Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”. </p>

<h4>Permutations </h4>

<p><span class="parno">24</span>If it is a legitimate legal procedure, and he perceives it as such, and he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension. </p>

<p><span class="parno">25</span>If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he is unsure of it, and he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension. </p>

<p><span class="parno">26</span>If it is a legitimate legal procedure, but he perceives it as illegitimate, and he does not stop, he commits an offense entailing suspension. </p>

<p><span class="parno">27</span>If it is an illegitimate legal procedure, but he perceives it as legitimate, he commits an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<h2>Non-offenses </h2>

<p><span class="parno">30</span>There is no offense: if he has not been pressed; if he stops; if he is insane; if he is deranged; if he is overwhelmed by pain; if he is the first offender. </p>

<p class="endsutta"><span class="parno">31</span>The training rule on schism in the Sangha, the tenth, is finished. </p>
