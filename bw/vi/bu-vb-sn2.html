<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1-2</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Udāyī was staying in the wilderness. He had a beautiful dwelling with a room in the middle and corridors on all sides. The bed and bench were nicely made up, and the water for drinking and the water for washing were ready for use. The yards were well swept. </p>

<p>Many people came to see Udāyī’s dwelling, among them a certain brahmin and his wife. They approached Udāyī and said: </p>

<p>“Venerable, we would like to see your dwelling.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, brahmin, please do.” Udāyī took the key, lifted the latch, opened the door, and entered the dwelling. The brahmin entered after him and then the brahmin lady. Opening some windows and closing others, Udāyī walked around the inner room and came up behind the brahmin lady, touching her all over. Then the brahmin thanked Udāyī and left. </p>

<p>And he expressed his delight, “These Sakyan monastics who live in the wilderness are superb. Venerable Udāyī is superb!” </p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>But the brahmin lady said, “What’s superb about him? He touched me all over just like you do.” </p>

<p>The brahmin then complained and criticized him, “These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. They claim to have integrity, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and good. But they don’t have the good character of a monastic or a brahmin. They’ve lost the plot! How could the ascetic Udāyī touch my wife all over? It’s not possible to go to a monastery or a monk’s dwelling with a wife from a respectable family, or with a daughter, a girl, a daughter-in-law, or a female slave from a respectable family. If you do, the Sakyan monastics might molest them.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>The monks heard the criticism of that brahmin. The monks of few desires complained and criticized Udāyī, “How could Venerable Udāyī make physical contact with a woman?” </p>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>They told the Buddha. He then had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: </p>

<p>“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “Foolish man, it’s not suitable, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you do this? Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">6</span>‘If a monk, overcome by lust and with a distorted mind, makes physical contact with a woman—holding her hand or hair, or touching any part of her body—he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” </p>
