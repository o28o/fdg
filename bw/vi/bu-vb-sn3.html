<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Udāyī was staying in a beautiful dwelling in the wilderness. 


On one occasion a number of women came to the monastery to see the dwellings. They approached Udāyī and said: </p>

<p>“Venerable, we would like to see your dwelling.” </p>

<hr>

<p>Then, after showing them his dwelling, he praised and disparaged their private parts; he requested and implored, asked and enquired, described, instructed, and abused their private parts. The shameless and indecent women flirted with Udāyī; they called out to him, laughed with him, and teased him. But after leaving, those of them who had a sense of shame complained to the monks, “Venerables, this isn’t suitable or appropriate. We wouldn’t want to hear such speech from our own husbands, let alone from Venerable Udāyī.” </p>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Udāyī speak indecently to women?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>They rebuked Udāyī in many ways and told the Buddha. The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: </p>

<p>“Is it true, Udāyī, that you spoke like this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it should not be done. How could you speak like this? Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">3</span>‘If a monk, overcome by lust and with a distorted mind, speaks indecent words to a woman, as a young man might to a young woman and referring to sexual intercourse, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” </p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span><strong>Referring to sexual intercourse: </strong> connected with the sexual act. </p>
