<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Udāyī was associating with and visiting a number of families in Sāvatthī. One morning Udāyī robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of a beautiful widow where he sat down on the prepared seat. She then approached Udāyī, bowed, and sat down. And Udāyī instructed, inspired, and gladdened her with a teaching. She then said, “Venerable, please tell me what you need. I can give robe-cloth, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicinal supplies.” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>“It’s not hard for us to get those requisites. Give instead what’s hard for us to get.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“What’s that, Venerable?” </p>

<p>“Sexual intercourse.” </p>

<p>“Is it wanted now?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Yes.” </p>

<p>Saying, “Come,” she entered her bedroom, took off her wrap, and lay back on the bed. Udāyī went up to her and spat out, “Who would touch this stinking wretch!” and he left. </p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>That woman then complained and criticized him, “These Sakyan monastics are shameless and immoral liars. They claim to have integrity, to be celibate and of good conduct, to be truthful, moral, and good. But they don’t have the good character of a monastic or  brahmin. They’ve lost the plot! How could the ascetic Udāyī ask for sexual intercourse from me, but then spit out, ‘Who would touch this stinking wretch!’ and leave? What’s bad about me? How am I stinking? How am I inferior to anyone?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">4</span>Other women, too, criticized him in the same way, </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">5</span>The monks heard the criticism of those women, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him, “How could Venerable Udāyī encourage a woman to satisfy his own desires?” </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">6</span>Those monks rebuked Udāyī in many ways and then told the Buddha. The Buddha had the Sangha gathered and questioned Udāyī: </p>

<p>“Is it true, Udāyī, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him, “It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How could you do such a thing? Haven’t I given many teachings for the sake of dispassion, not for the sake of passion … the stilling of the fevers of sensual pleasure? This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">7</span>‘If a monk, overcome by lust and with a distorted mind, encourages a woman to satisfy his own desires, saying, “Sister, she provides the highest service who in this way satisfies one like me, who is virtuous, celibate, and of good character,” and if it is a reference to sexual intercourse, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p><span class="parno">8</span><strong>A: </strong> whoever … <strong>Monk: </strong> … The monk who has been given the full ordination by a unanimous Sangha through a legal procedure consisting of one motion and three announcements that is irreversible and fit to stand—this sort of monk is meant in this case. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">9</span><strong>Overcome by lust: </strong> having lust, longing for, in love with. </p>

<p><span class="parno">10</span><strong>Distorted: </strong> A lustful mind is distorted; an angry mind is distorted; a confused mind is distorted. But in this case “distorted” refers to the lustful mind. </p>

<p><span class="parno">11</span><strong>A woman: </strong> a human female, not a female spirit, not a female ghost, not a female animal. She understands and is capable of discerning bad speech and good speech, what is decent and what is indecent. </p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span><strong>The highest: </strong> this is the highest, this is the best, this is the foremost, this is the utmost, this is the most excellent. </p>

<p><span class="parno">15</span><strong>She: </strong> a aristocrat woman, a brahmin woman, a merchant woman, or a woman worker. </p>

<p><span class="parno">16</span><strong>One like me: </strong> a male aristocrat, a male brahmin, a male merchant, or a male worker. </p>

<p><span class="parno">18</span><strong>Celibate: </strong> one who refrains from sexual intercourse. </p>

<p><span class="parno">19</span><strong>Of good character: </strong> he is one of good character because of that virtue and because of being celibate. </p>

<p><span class="parno">20</span><strong>In this way: </strong> with sexual intercourse. </p>

<p><span class="parno">21</span><strong>Satisfies: </strong> gives pleasure to. </p>

<hr>

<p><span class="parno">22</span><strong>If it is a reference to sexual intercourse: </strong> if it is connected with the sexual act. </p>

<p><span class="parno">23</span><strong>He commits an offense entailing suspension: </strong> … Therefore, too, it is called “an offense entailing suspension”. </p>
