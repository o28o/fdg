<h3>Origin story </h3>

<p><span class="parno">1</span>At one time when the Buddha was staying at Kosambī in Ghosita’s Monastery, a householder who was a supporter of Venerable Channa said to him, “I’ll have a dwelling built for you, Venerable, if you would find a site for it.” </p>

<p>While Venerable Channa was clearing a site for that dwelling, he felled a tree that served as a shrine and was revered by village, town, district, and kingdom. People complained and criticized him, “How could the Sakyan monastics fell a tree that serves as a shrine and is revered by village, town, district, and kingdom? They are hurting one-sensed life.” </p>

<p><span class="parno">2</span>The monks heard the criticism of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized Venerable Channa in the same way. </p>

<p><span class="parno">3</span>After rebuking Venerable Channa in many ways, they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Sangha gathered and questioned Channa: “Is it true, Channa, that you did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked him … “Foolish man, how could you do this? People perceive trees as conscious. This will affect people’s confidence …” … “And, monks, this training rule should be recited like this: </p>

<h3>Final ruling </h3>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">4</span>‘When a monk builds a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for himself, he must have monks approve a site where no harm will be done and which has space on all sides. If a monk builds a large dwelling on a site where harm will be done and which lacks space on all sides, or he does not have monks approve the site, he commits an offense entailing suspension.’” </p>

<h3>Definitions </h3>

<p><span class="parno">5</span><strong>A large dwelling: </strong> one with a sponsoring owner is what is meant. </p>

<p><span class="parno">6</span><strong>Dwelling: </strong> plastered inside or plastered outside or plastered both inside and outside. </p>

<p><span class="parno">7</span><strong>Builds: </strong> building it himself or having it built. </p>

<p><span class="parno">10</span><strong>He must have monks approve a site: </strong> The monk who is building a dwelling should clear a site, then approach the Sangha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: </p>

<p>“Venerables, I want to build a large dwelling with a sponsoring owner and intended for myself. I request the Sangha to inspect the site for the dwelling.” </p>

<p>He should make his request a second and a third time. If the whole Sangha is able to inspect the site, they should all go. If the whole Sangha is unable to inspect the site, then those monks there who are competent and capable—who know where harm will be done and where no harm will be done, and who understands the meaning of having space on all sides and lacking space on all sides—should be asked and then appointed. </p>

<p>“And, monks, they should be appointed like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Sangha: </p>

<p><span class="parno">13</span>The Sangha has appointed monk so-and-so and monk so-and-so to inspect the site for the dwelling of monk so-and-so. The Sangha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’ </p>

<p><span class="parno">14</span>The appointed monks should go and inspect the site for the dwelling to find out if any harm will be done and if it has space on all sides. If harm will be done and it lacks space on all sides, they should say, ‘Don’t build here.’ If no harm will be done and it has space on all sides, they should inform the Sangha: ‘No harm will be done and it has space on all sides.’ The monk who is building the dwelling should then approach the Sangha, arrange his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: </p>
