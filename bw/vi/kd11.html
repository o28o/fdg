<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>Homage to the Buddha, the Perfected One, the fully Awakened One </p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka were quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha. They went to other monks who were also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha, and said to them: “Don’t let him beat you. Argue back forcefully. You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he. Don’t be afraid of him. We’ll take your side.” Because of that, new quarrels started and existing quarrels became worse. </p>

<hr>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka act like this?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are acting like this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can they act like this, 

causing that new quarrels to start and existing quarrels to become worse? This will affect people’s confidence, and cause some to lose it.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>The Buddha then spoke in many ways in dispraise of being difficult to support and maintain, in dispraise of great desires, discontent, socializing, and laziness; but he spoke in many ways in praise of being easy to support and maintain, of fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, serenity, reduction in things, and being energetic. After giving a teaching on what is right and proper, he addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>“Well then, monks, the Saṅgha should do a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. And this is how it should be done. </p>

<p>First you should accuse the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. They should then be reminded of what they’ve done, before they’re charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha. They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha, and they say to them:</p>

<p>“Don’t let him beat you. Argue back forcefully. You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he. Don’t be afraid of him. We’ll take your side.” Because of this, new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. This is the motion. </p>

<p>Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha. They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha, and they say to them:</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>“Don’t let him beat you. Argue back forcefully. You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he. Don’t be afraid of him. We’ll take your side.” Because of this, new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse. The Saṅgha does a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. Any monk who approves of doing this legal procedure should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p>For the second time I speak on this matter. Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha. They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha, and they say to them:</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>“Don’t let him beat you. Argue back forcefully. You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he. Don’t be afraid of him. We’ll take your side.” Because of this, new quarrels start and existing quarrels become worse. The Saṅgha does a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. Any monk who approves of doing this legal procedure should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<hr>

<p>For the third time I speak on this matter. Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. These monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka are quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha. They go to other monks who are also quarrelsome, argumentative, and creators of legal issues in the Saṅgha, and they say to them: </p>

<p>“Don’t let him beat you. Argue back forcefully. You’re wiser, more competent, more learned, and more capable than he. Don’t be afraid of him.

<hr>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>The Saṅgha has done a legal procedure of condemnation against the monks Paṇḍuka and Lohitaka. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” </p>

They sat on the same seats as them, and they lay down on the same beds, on the same sheets, under the same covers, both on the same sheets and under the same covers. They ate at the wrong time, drank alcohol, and wore garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics. They danced, sang, played instruments, and performed. While the women were dancing, singing, playing instruments, and performing, so would they. </p>

<p>They played various games: eight-row checkers, ten-row checkers, imaginary checkers, hopscotch, pick-up-sticks, dice, tip-cat, painting with the hand, ball games, leaf flutes, toy plows, somersaults, toy windmills, toy measures, toy carriages, toy bows, letter guessing, thought guessing, mimicking deformities.  They trained in elephant riding, in horsemanship, in carriage riding, in archery, in swordsmanship. And they ran in front of elephants, in front of horses, and in front of carriages, and they ran backward and forward. They whistled, clapped their hands, wrestled, and boxed. They spread their outer robe on a stage and said to the dancing girls: “Dance here, Sister,” and they made gestures of approval. And they misbehaved in a variety of ways. </p>

<p id="119"><span class="parno">119</span>Just then a monk who had completed the rains residence in Kāsī was on his way to visit the Buddha at Sāvatthī when he arrived at Kīṭāgiri. In the morning he robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Kīṭāgiri to collect almsfood. He was pleasing in his conduct: in going out and coming back, in looking ahead and looking aside, in bending and stretching his arms. His eyes were lowered, and he was perfect in deportment. </p>

<hr>

<p>When people saw him, they said: </p>

<p>“Who’s this, acting like a moron and always frowning? Who’s gonna give almsfood to him? Almsfood should be given to our Venerables Assaji and Punabbasuka, for they’re gentle, congenial, pleasant to speak with, greeting one with a smile, welcoming, friendly, open, the first to speak.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p120-122"><span class="parno">120-122</span>A certain lay follower saw that monk walking for alms in Kīṭāgiri. He approached him, bowed, and said: “Venerable, have you received any almsfood?” </p>

<p>“No, I haven’t.” </p>

<p>“Come, let’s go to my house.” </p>

<hr>

<p>He took that monk to his house and gave him a meal. He then said: “Where are you going, Venerable?” </p>

<p>“I’m going to Sāvatthī to see the Buddha.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, would you please pay respect at the feet of the Buddha in my name and say, ‘Venerable Sir, the monastery at Kīṭāgiri has been corrupted. The bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are staying there. And they’re misbehaving in many ways. They plant flowering trees, water them … </p>

<p>


And they misbehave in a variety of ways. Those who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it, and there’s no longer any support for the Saṅgha. The good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on. Sir, please send monks to stay at the monastery in Kīṭāgiri.’” </p>

<hr>

<p>The monk consented, got up, and set out for Sāvatthī. When he eventually arrived, he went to the Buddha in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. He bowed to the Buddha and sat down. Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said to him: </p>

<p>“I hope you are keeping well, monk, I hope you’re getting by.  I hope you’re not tired from traveling.  And where have you come from?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“I’m keeping well, Venerable Sir, I’m getting by. I’m not tired from traveling.” He then told the Buddha all that had happened at Kīṭāgiri, adding: “That’s where I’ve come from, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="123"><span class="parno">123</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the bad and shameless monks Assaji and Punabbasuka are staying at Kīṭāgiri and misbehaving in this way? And is it true that those people who previously had faith and confidence have now lost it, that there’s no longer any support for the Saṅgha, and that the good monks have left and the bad monks are staying on?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “It’s not suitable … How can those foolish men misbehave in this way? 

This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed Sāriputta and Moggallāna: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Go to Kīṭāgiri and do a legal procedure of banishing the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka. They’re your students.” </p>

<p id="124"><span class="parno">124</span>“Sir, how can we do a procedure of banishing these monks from Kīṭāgiri? They’re temperamental and harsh.” </p>

<p>“Well then, take many monks.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Alright.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“And this is how it should be done. First you should accuse the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka. They should then be reminded of what they’ve done, before they’re charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p>Sudhamma thought: “Previously when Citta wanted to invite the Saṅgha, a group of monks, or an individual monk, he wouldn’t do so without getting my permission. But now he has. He’s been corrupted, this Citta. He’s uninterested and has no affection for me.” He said to Citta:</p>

<p>“There’s no need. I won’t accept.” </p>

<hr>

<p>Citta asked him a second and a third time, but got the same reply. </p>

<hr>

<p>He thought: “What difference does it make to me whether Sudhamma accepts or not?” He then bowed, circumambulated Sudhamma with his right side toward him, and left. </p>

<hr>

<p id="173"><span class="parno">173</span>The following morning Citta prepared various kinds of fine food for the senior monks. Sudhamma thought: “Why don’t I go and see what Citta has prepared for the senior monks?” He then robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Citta’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat. Citta approached Sudhamma, bowed, and sat down. And Sudhamma said to him: </p>

<p>“You have prepared many kinds of food. But there’s one that’s missing: sesame cookies.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“When there are so many jewels in the word of the Buddha, Sir, you speak of sesame cookies. In the past there were some traders from the south who went to an eastern country to trade. From there they brought back a hen. That hen mated with a crow and because of that she had a chick. When that chick wanted to caw like a crow, it cried, ‘caw-ca-doodle-doo.’ And when that chick wanted to crow like a rooster, it cried, ‘cock-a-doodle-caw.’ In the same way, when there are so many jewels in the word of the Buddha, you speak of sesame cookies.” </p>

<p>“Householder, you’re abusing and insulting me. I will leave your monastery.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“I’m not abusing and insulting you. Please stay at Macchikāsaṇḍa. The mango grove is delightful. I’ll do my best to supply you with robe-cloth, almsfood, a dwelling, and medicinal supplies.” </p>

<p>Sudhamma repeated what he had said a second time and Citta responded as before. When Sudhamma repeated it a third time, 
Citta said: “Where will you go?” </p>

<p>“I’ll go to Sāvatthī to visit the Buddha.” </p>

<p>“Well then, please tell the Buddha of our entire conversation. And I would not be surprised if you returned to Macchikāsaṇḍa.” </p>

<p id="174"><span class="parno">174</span>Sudhamma put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robe, and left for Sāvatthī. When he eventually arrived, he went to the Buddha in Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. He bowed to the Buddha, sat down, and told him about the conversation he had had with Citta. </p>

<p id="175"><span class="parno">175</span>The Buddha rebuked him: “It’s not suitable, foolish man, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can you demean and insult Citta, who has faith and confidence, who’s a donor, benefactor, and supporter of the Saṅgha? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, do a legal procedure of reconciliation against the monk Sudhamma, instructing him to ask Citta for forgiveness. And it should be done like this. First you should accuse the monk Sudhamma. He should then be reminded of what he has done, before he’s charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p id="176"><span class="parno">176</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen.

<h4>7. The legal procedure of ejection for not giving up a bad view </h4>

<p id="297"><span class="parno">297</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time the monk Ariṭṭha, the ex-vulture-killer, had the following bad and erroneous view: </p>

<p>“As I understand the Teaching of the Buddha, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them.” </p>

<hr>

<p>A number of monks heard that Ariṭṭha had that view. </p>

<hr>

<p id="298"><span class="parno">298</span>They went to him and asked:</p>

<p>“Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that you have such a view?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Yes, indeed. As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them.” </p>

<p id="299"><span class="parno">299</span>“No, Ariṭṭha, don’t misrepresent the Buddha, for it’s not good to misrepresent him. The Buddha would never say such a thing. The Buddha has given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them. The Buddha has said that there’s little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater. The Buddha has said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton, similar to a piece of meat, similar to a grass torch, similar to a pit of coals, similar to a dream, similar to borrowed goods, similar to fruits on a tree, similar to a knife and chopping block, similar to swords and stakes, and similar to a snake’s head. They’re much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="300"><span class="parno">300</span>But even though the monks corrected Ariṭṭha in this way, he stubbornly held on to that bad and erroneous view, and continued to insist on it. And since they were unable to make him give up that view, they went to the Buddha and told him what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p id="301"><span class="parno">301</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned Ariṭṭha: </p>

<p>“Is it true, Ariṭṭha, that you have a bad and erroneous view such as this: ‘As I understand the Buddha’s Teaching, the things he calls obstructive are not able to obstruct one who indulges in them’?” </p>

<p>“Yes indeed, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="302"><span class="parno">302</span>“Foolish man, who do you think I’ve taught like this? Haven’t I given many discourses about the obstructive things being obstructive and how they obstruct one who indulges in them? I’ve said that there’s little enjoyment in worldly pleasures, but much suffering and much trouble, and that the danger in them is greater. I’ve said that worldly pleasures are similar to a skeleton, similar to a piece of meat, similar to a grass torch, similar to a pit of coals, similar to a dream, similar to borrowed goods, similar to fruits on a tree, similar to a knife and chopping block, similar to swords and stakes, and similar to a snake’s head. They’re much suffering and much trouble, and the danger in them is greater. And yet by misunderstanding, you have misrepresented me, hurt yourself, and made much demerit. This will be for your long-lasting harm and suffering. And this will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“Well then, the Saṅgha should do a legal procedure of ejecting Ariṭṭha for not giving up a bad view, prohibiting him from living with the Saṅgha. And this is how it should be done. First you should accuse the monk Ariṭṭha. He should then be reminded of what he has done, before he’s charged with an offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha: </p>
