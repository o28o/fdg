<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time monks on probation consented to regular monks bowing down to them, standing up for them, raising their joined palms to them, doing acts of respect toward them, offering them a seat, offering them a bed, offering them water for washing their feet and a foot stool, offering them a foot scraper, receiving their bowl and robe, and massaging their backs when bathing. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can monks on probation consent to these things?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks on probation are consenting to these things?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … “It’s not suitable … How can monks on probation consent to these things? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p>“A monk on probation shouldn’t consent to: </p>

<p>Regular monks bowing down to him; </p>

<hr>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>Monks on probation should do the following with one another according to seniority: bow down, stand up, raise their joined palms, do acts of respect, offer a seat, offer a bed, offer water for washing the feet and a foot stool, offer a foot scraper, receive bowl and robe, and massage one another’s backs when bathing. </p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Monks on probation should do five things with regular monks according to seniority: the observance-day ceremony, the invitation ceremony, distributing rainy-season robes, meal invitations, and meals. </p>
