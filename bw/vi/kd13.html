<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time Venerable Udāyī had committed one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. He told the monks about this, adding: “What should I do now?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p>“Well then, the Saṅgha should give the monk Udāyī the trial period of six days for one unconcealed offense of intentional emission of semen. </p>

<h4>2.5 Purifying probation </h4>

<p id="p160"><span class="parno">160</span>At one time a monk had committed a number of offenses entailing suspension. He did not know the number of offenses or the number of days; he did not remember the number of offenses or the number of days; he was unsure of the number of offenses and the number of days. He told the monks about this, adding: “What should I do now?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p>“Well then, the Saṅgha should give that monk a purifying probation for those offenses. And it should be given like this. </p>

<p id="p161"><span class="parno">161</span>That monk should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the senior monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: </p>

I don’t know the number of offenses or the number of days; I don’t remember the number of offenses or the number of days; I’m unsure of the number of offenses and the number of days.
