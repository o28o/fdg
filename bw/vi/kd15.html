<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time the monks from the group of six rubbed their bodies—thighs, arms, chest, and back—against trees while bathing. People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics do this? They’re just like boxers and city slickers who beautify their bodies!” The monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are doing this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them: “It’s not suitable for those foolish men, it’s not proper, it’s not worthy of a monastic, it’s not allowable, it’s not to be done. How can they do this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t rub your body against a tree while bathing. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>At that time the monks from the group of six rubbed their bodies—thighs, arms, chest, and back—against posts while bathing.

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>At that time the monks from the group of six rubbed their bodies—thighs, arms, chest, and back—against walls while bathing. People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics do this? They’re just like boxers and city slickers who beautify their bodies!” … </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t rub your body against a wall while bathing. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>At that time the monks from the group of six rubbed their bodies—thighs, arms, chest, and back—against a rubbing board while bathing.

</p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t rub your body against a rubbing board while bathing. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>At that time the monks from the group of six bathed with a wooden rubbing-hand. People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics do this? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” The monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t bathe with a wooden rubbing-hand. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>At that time the monks from the group of six bathed with a string of cinnabar beads. People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics do this? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t bathe with a string of cinnabar beads. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>At that time the monks from the group of six massaged one another. People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics do this? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>Soon afterwards a certain monk had an itchy skin disease. He was not comfortable without a scrubber. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow a plain scrubber for those who are sick.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>At that time a monk who was weak from old age was unable to rub his own body while bathing. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow gloves of cloth.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not give back massages. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow an ordinary massage by hand.” </p>

<h4>Rules on personal beautification </h4>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>At that time the monks from the group of six wore earrings, ornamental hanging strings, necklaces, ornamental girdles, bangles, armlets, bracelets, and rings. People complained and criticized them … “… They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” The monks heard the complaints of those people. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are wearing these things?” 

“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t wear earrings, an ornamental hanging string, a necklace, an ornamental girdle, a bangle, an armlet, a bracelet, or a ring. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t grow your hair long. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to grow it to a length of 3.5 centimeters or for two months at the most.” </p>

<p><p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>At that time the monks from the group of six brushed their hair, and they combed it, combed it with their hands, smoothed it with beeswax, and smoothed it with water and oil. People complained and criticized them: “They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t brush your hair, or comb it, comb it with your hands, smooth it with beeswax, or smooth it with water and oil. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p><p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>At that time the monks from the group of six looked at their faces in mirrors and in bowls of water. People complained and criticized them: “They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t look at your face in a mirror or in a bowl of water. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>Soon afterwards a certain monk had a sore on his face. He asked the monks: “What kind of sore is it?” They replied: “It’s this kind of sore.” He did not trust them. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to look at your face in a mirror or in a bowl of water if you have a disease.” </p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>At that time the monks from the group of six used facial ointments, applied facial creams, powdered their face, applied rouge to their face, wore cosmetics on the body, wore cosmetics on the face, and wore cosmetics on the body and face. People complained and criticized them: “They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” </p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>Soon afterwards a certain monk had an eye disease. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow facial ointments for those who are sick.” </p>

<h4>Rules on entertainment, etc. </h4>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>On one occasion in Rājagaha there was a hilltop fair, and the monks from the group of six went to see it. People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics go and see dancing, singing, and music? They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t go and see dancing, singing, and music. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>At that time the monks from the group of six were singing the Teaching with a drawn-out voice. People complained and criticized them: “These Sakyan monastics sing with a drawn-out voice just like we do.” The monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six sing like this?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are singing like this?” “It’s true, Sir.” … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“There are these five dangers in singing the Teaching with a drawn-out voice: one delights in the sound; others delight in the sound; householders criticize it; for one who takes pleasure in performing with the voice, the concentration is disrupted; later generations follow one’s example. </p>

<p></p>

<p class="rule">You shouldn’t sing the Teaching with a drawn-out voice. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not chant. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow chanting.” </p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>At that time the monks from the group of six wore fleecy woolen robes with fleece on the outside. People complained and criticized them: “They’re just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t wear a fleecy woolen robe with fleece on the outside. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>Rules on fruit </h4>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>On one occasion when the mango trees in King Bimbisāra’s park were bearing fruit, the King allowed the monks to eat as many mangoes as they wished. The monks from the group of six plucked and ate them all, even the unripe ones. Just then the King needed mangoes. He told his people: “Go to the park and bring back mangoes.” Saying: “Yes, Sir,” they went to the park and said to the park keeper: “The King needs mangoes. Please get some.” </p>

<p>“There aren’t any. The monks plucked and ate them all, including the unripe ones.” </p>

<p>They reported it to the King. He said: “It’s good that the venerables have eaten the mangoes. Still, the Buddha has praised moderation.” </p>

<p>People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics eat the King’s mangoes without moderation?” The monks heard the complaints of those people and then told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t eat mangoes. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Saṅgha. They had prepared mango curry. Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept it. </p>

<p class="rule">“Accept, monks, and eat it. I allow pieces of mango.” </p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Saṅgha. They were unable to prepare mango pieces and so gave whole mangoes in the dining hall. Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not accept them. </p>

<p class="rule">“Accept, monks, and eat it. I allow you to eat fruit that’s allowable for monastics for any of five reasons: it’s been damaged by fire, a knife, or a nail, or it’s seedless, or the seeds have been removed.” </p>




<h4>Protection </h4>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>On one occasion a monk had been bitten by a snake and died. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p>“That monk hadn’t spread good will to the four royal snake clans. Had he done so, he wouldn’t have died. What are the four clans? The Virūpakkhas, the Erāpathas, the Chabyāputtas, and the Kaṇhāgotamas. 
To protect yourselves, monks, you should spread good will to these four royal snake clans. And it should be done like this: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>I have good will toward the Virūpakkhas,
<br>Toward the Erāpathas I have good will;
<br>I have good will toward the Chabyāputtas,
<br>And toward the Kaṇhāgotamas.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>I have good will toward the legless,
<br>Toward the two-legged I have good will;
<br>I have good will toward the four-legged,
<br>And toward the many-legged.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>May the legless not hurt me,
<br>May the two-legged not hurt me.
<br>May the four-legged not hurt me,
<br>May the many-legged not hurt me.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p30"><span class="parno">30</span>All beings, all creatures,
<br>All living beings everywhere,
<br>May they all have good fortune,
<br>May none meet with anything bad.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>The Buddha is unlimited,
<br>The Teaching is unlimited,
<br>The Saṅgha is unlimited.
<br>But creeping animals are limited:</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>Snakes, scorpions, centipedes,
<br>Spiders, lizards, and mice.
<br>I’m now protected and guarded;
<br>May the creatures turn back.
<br>I pay homage to the Buddha,
<br>To the seven fully awakened Buddhas.”</p>
</div>


<hr>


<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>On one occasion a monk who was plagued by lust cut off his own penis. They told the Buddha. He said: “This fool has cut off one thing, when he should’ve cut off something else. </p>

<p class="rule">You shouldn’t cut off your own penis. If you do, you commit a serious offense.” </p>

<h4>Rules relating to bowls </h4>

<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>On one occasion a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha had obtained a valuable block of sandalwood. He thought: “Why don’t I have a bowl carved from this block of sandal? I’d use the chips myself, but give the bowl away as a gift.” He then had a bowl carved, put it in a carrying net, hung it at the end of a succession of vertical bamboo poles, and announced: “I’ll give this bowl to any perfected monastic or brahmin who brings it down by supernormal power.” </p>

<p>Pūraṇa Kassapa went to that merchant and said: “I’m perfected and have supernormal powers. Give me the bowl.” </p>

<p>“If you’re perfected and have supernormal powers, then bring it down and it’s yours.” </p>

<p>The same thing happened with Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambala, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañcaya Belaṭṭhaputta, and Nigaṇṭha Nāṭaputta. 
</p>

<hr>

<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, Venerable Mahāmoggallāna and Venerable Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja took their bowls and robes and entered Rājagaha for alms. Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja said to Mahāmoggallāna: “Venerable, you’re perfected and have supernormal powers. If you go and bring down that bowl, it’s yours.” </p>

<p>“Venerable, you too are perfected and have supernormal powers. If you bring it down, it’s yours.” </p>

<p>Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja then rose into the air, took hold of that bowl, and circled around Rājagaha three times. </p>

The merchant then took the bowl from his hands, filled it with expensive fresh foods, and gave it back to Piṇḍola Bhāradvāja, who then left for the monastery. </p>

<h4>The overturning of the bowl </h4>

<p id="p103"><span class="parno">103</span>At one time Vaḍḍha the Licchavī was a friend of the monks Mettiya and Bhūmajaka. On one occasion he went to them and said: “Respectful greetings, Venerables.” They did not respond. A second time

<hr>

<p>“Have I done something wrong? Why don’t you respond?” </p>

<p>“It’s because we’ve been treated badly by Dabba the Mallian, and you’re not taking an interest.” </p>

<p>“But what can I do?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“If you like, you could make the Buddha expel Dabba.” </p>

<p>“And how can I do that?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Go to the Buddha and say, ‘Sir, this is not proper or appropriate. There’s fear, distress, and oppression in this district, where none of these should exist. It’s windy where it should be calm. It’s as if water is burning. Venerable Dabba the Mallian has raped my wife.’” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p104"><span class="parno">104</span>Saying: “Alright, Venerables,” he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and repeated what he had been told to say. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p105"><span class="parno">105</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned Dabba: “Dabba, do you remember doing as Vaḍḍha says?” </p>

<p>“Venerable Sir, you know what I’m like.” </p>

<hr>

<p>A second and a third time the Buddha asked the same question and got the same response. He then said: “Dabba, the Dabbas don’t give such evasive answers. If it was done by you, say so; if it wasn’t, then say that.” </p>

<p>“Since I was born, Sir, I don’t recall having sexual intercourse even in a dream, let alone when awake.” </p>

<p>The Buddha addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, monks, the Saṅgha should overturn the almsbowl against Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, prohibiting him from interacting with the Saṅgha. </p>

<p class="rule"></p>



<p>And the overturning of the bowl is to be done like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p107"><span class="parno">107</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Vaḍḍha the Licchavī is groundlessly charging Venerable Dabba the Mallian with failure in morality.

<h4>Turning the bowl upright </h4>

<p id="p110"><span class="parno">110</span>After robing up the following morning, Venerable Ānanda took his bowl and robe, went to the house of Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, and told him: “Vaḍḍha, the Saṅgha has overturned the bowl against you. You’re prohibited from interacting with the Saṅgha.” And Vaḍḍha fainted right there. But Vaḍḍha’s friends and relatives said to him:</p>

<p>“Don’t be sad, Vaḍḍha. We’ll reconcile you with the Buddha and the Saṅgha of monks.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p111"><span class="parno">111</span>Soon afterwards Vaḍḍha, together with his wives and children, together with his friends and relatives, with wet clothes and wet hair, went to the Buddha. He bowed down at the Buddha’s feet and said: “Sir, I’ve made a mistake. I’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. Please forgive me so that I may restrain myself in the future.” </p>

<p>“You have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint in the future.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha then addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“Well then, the Saṅgha should turn the almsbowl upright for Vaḍḍha the Licchavī, allowing him to interact with the Saṅgha. </p>

<p></p>



<p>And the turning of the bowl upright is to be done like this. Vaḍḍha the Licchavī should approach the Saṅgha, put his upper robe over one shoulder, pay respect at the feet of the monks, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: </p>

<p>‘Venerables, the Saṅgha has overturned the bowl against me, prohibiting me from interacting with the Saṅgha. I’m now conducting myself properly and suitably so as to deserve to be released. I ask the Saṅgha to turn the bowl upright for me.’ And he should ask a second and a third time. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<h4>Rules about stepping on cloth </h4>

<p id="p116"><span class="parno">116</span>When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward the country of Bhaggā. When he eventually arrived, he stayed at Susumāragira in the Bhesakaḷā Grove, the deer park. </p>

<p>At this time Prince Bodhi had recently built the Kokanada stilt house. It had not yet been inhabited by any monastic or brahmin, or anyone else. </p>

<hr>

<p>The Prince said to the young brahmin Sañcikāputta: “My dear Sañcikāputta, please go to the Buddha, bow down in my name with your head at his feet, and ask if he’s healthy, strong, and living at ease. And then say, ‘Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal, together with the Saṅgha of monks, from Prince Bodhi.’” </p>

<p>Saying: “Yes, Sir,” Sañcikāputta went to the Buddha and exchanged pleasantries with him. He then sat down and told the Buddha all he had been asked to say, concluding with the invitation for the meal on the following day. The Buddha consented by remaining silent. Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Sañcikāputta got up from his seat, returned to the Prince, and told him what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p117"><span class="parno">117</span>The next morning Prince Bodhi had various kinds of fine food prepared, and had the entire Kokanada stilt house covered with white cloth, all the way to the bottom step of the staircase. He then said to Sañcikāputta: “Go to the Buddha and tell him the meal is ready.” And Sañcikāputta did as instructed. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p118"><span class="parno">118</span>Soon afterwards, the Buddha robed up in the morning, took his bowl and robe, and went the Prince’s house. The Prince was standing outside the gatehouse, waiting for the Buddha. When he saw the Buddha coming, he went out to meet him, bowed down to him, and then returned to the Kokanada stilt house with the Buddha in front. </p>

<p>But the Buddha stopped at the bottom stair of that staircase. The Prince said: “Sir, please step on the cloth. It will be for my longterm benefit and happiness.” The Buddha remained silent. A second time the Prince repeated his request, but the Buddha still remained silent. When the Prince made his request for the third time, the Buddha looked at Venerable Ānanda. And Ānanda said to the Prince: “Please fold up the cloth. The Buddha doesn’t step on cloth coverings. He has compassion for later generations.” </p>

<p id="p119"><span class="parno">119</span>The Prince then had the cloth folded up and had a seat prepared up in the stilt house. The Buddha ascended the house and sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of monks. The Prince personally served the various kinds of fine food to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, the Prince sat down to one side. The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching, after which he got up from his seat and left. </p>

<p>Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t step on a cloth covering. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p id="p120"><span class="parno">120</span>On one occasion a woman who was unable to conceive invited the monks, prepared a cloth, and said: “Venerables, please step on the cloth.” But being afraid of wrongdoing, they refused. “Please step on the cloth as a blessing.” They still refused.

They said to that lay follower: “These venerables of yours are coming. They’re holding sunshades, just like accountants and government officials.” </p>

<p>“These aren’t monks. They’re wanderers.” And they made a bet on whether they were monks or not. </p>

<p>When the monks came close, that lay follower recognized them. And he complained and criticized them: “How can the venerables walk about holding sunshades?” The monks heard the complaints of that lay follower and they told the Buddha. </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are doing this?” “It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<h4>Even more rules on proper conduct and allowable requisites </h4>

<p id="p195"><span class="parno">195</span>At one time the monks from the group of six were misbehaving in many ways. </p>

<p>They planted flowering trees, watered and plucked them, and then tied the flowers together. They made the flowers into garlands, garlands with stalks on one side and garlands with stalks on both sides. They made flower arrangements, wreaths, ornaments for the head, ornaments for the ears, and ornaments for the chest. And they had others do the same. They then took these things, or sent them, to the women, the daughters, the girls, the daughters-in-law, and the female slaves of respectable families. </p>

<p>They ate from the same plates as these women and drank from the same vessels. They sat on the same seats as them, and they lay down on the same beds, on the same sheets, under the same covers, and both on the same sheets and under the same covers. They ate at the wrong time, drank alcohol, and wore garlands, perfumes, and cosmetics. They danced, sang, played instruments, and performed. While the women were dancing, singing, playing instruments, and performing, so would they. </p>

<p>They played various games: eight-row checkers, ten-row checkers, imaginary checkers, hopscotch, pick-up-sticks, dice, tip-cat, painting with the hand, ball games, leaf flutes, toy plows, somersaults, toy windmills, toy measures, toy carriages, toy bows, letter guessing, thought guessing, mimicking deformities. </p>

<p>They trained in elephant riding, in horsemanship, in carriage riding, in archery, in swordsmanship. And they ran in front of elephants, horses, and carriages, and they ran backward and forward. They whistled, clapped their hands, wrestled, and boxed. They spread their outer robes on a stage and said to the dancing girls: “Dance here, Sister,” and they made gestures of approval. And they misbehaved in a variety of ways. </p>

<p>They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You shouldn’t engage in various kinds of misbehavior If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p196"><span class="parno">196</span>At the time of Venerable Uruvelakassapa’s going forth, the Saṅgha was offered a large number of iron, wooden, and ceramic goods. The monks thought: “Which iron, wooden, and ceramic goods have been allowed by the Buddha, and which not?” They told the Buddha. The Buddha then gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow all iron goods except weapons; all wooden goods except high couches, luxurious couches, wooden almsbowls, and wooden shoes; and all ceramic goods except ceramic foot scrubbers and clay huts.” </p>
