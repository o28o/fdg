<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At this time the Buddha had not yet allowed dwellings. And the monks stayed here and there: in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, on a hill, in a gorge, in a hillside cave, in a charnel ground, in the forest, in the open, on a heap of straw. Early in the morning, they would emerge from those places. And they were pleasing in their conduct: in going out and coming back, in looking ahead and looking aside, in bending and stretching their arms. Their eyes were lowered, and they were perfect in deportment. </p>

<hr>

<p>One morning a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha was going to a park when he saw those monks. 

Being inspired, he approached them and said: “Venerables, if I build dwellings, would you stay there?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“The Buddha hasn’t allowed dwellings.” </p>

<p>“Well then, please ask the Buddha and let me know his response.” </p>

<p>“Yes.” Those monks then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, a wealthy merchant of Rājagaha wants to build dwellings. What should we do?” Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow five kinds of shelters: dwellings, three kinds of stilt houses, and caves.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>The monks went to that merchant and said: “The Buddha has allowed dwellings. Please do whatever you think is appropriate.” Then, on a single day, that merchant built sixty dwellings. When the dwellings were finished, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me, together with the Saṅgha of monks.” The Buddha consented by remaining silent. Knowing that the Buddha had consented, he got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. </p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>The next morning he had various kinds of fine food prepared and then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to the house of that merchant, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of monks. That merchant personally served various kinds of fine food to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, the merchant sat down to one side and said: “Sir, I’ve had these sixty dwellings built to make merit and for the purpose of going to heaven. What should I do now?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, give those sixty dwellings to the Saṅgha everywhere, both present and future.” </p>

<p>Saying: “Yes,” he did just that. </p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>The Buddha then expressed his appreciation to the merchant with these verses: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>“Cold and heat are kept away,
<br>And predatory animals too,
<br>And creeping animals and mosquitoes,
<br>And also chill and rain.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>It keeps away the wind and burning sun,
<br>When those awful things arise.
<br>It’s for the sake of shelter and happiness,
<br>To attain absorption and to see clearly.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>Giving dwellings to the Saṅgha
<br>Is praised as the best by the Buddha.
<br>Therefore the wise man,
<br>Seeing what is beneficial for himself,</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>Should build delightful dwellings
<br>And have the learned stay there.
<br>Food, drink, robes, and dwellings—
<br>With an inspired mind,</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>He should give to them,
<br>The upright ones.
<br>They will give him the Teaching
<br>For removing all suffering;
<br>And understanding this Teaching in this life,
<br>He attains extinguishment, free of corruptions.”</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>The Buddha then got up from his seat and left. </p>



<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>Hearing that the Buddha had allowed dwellings, people had dwellings built with care. But because the dwellings did not have doors, snakes, scorpions, and centipedes came inside. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow doors.” </p>

<p>They made a hole in the wall and bound the doors with creepers and ropes. Rats and termites ate the creepers and ropes, and the doors fell off. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow door frames, and lower and upper hinges.” </p>

<p>The doors did not touch the door frames. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow a hole in the door for pulling it and a rope for pulling it.” </p>

<p>The doors did not stay closed. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow bolt-receiving posts, bolt sockets, bolts, and upper bolts.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>The monks were not able to open the doors. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow a keyhole and three kinds of keys: metal keys, wooden keys, and keys made of horn.” </p>

<hr>

<p>They unlocked the doors with the keys and entered, but the dwellings were unprotected. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow bolts.” </p>



<hr>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>At that time the dwellings had roofs of straw. When the weather was cold, they were cold, and when the weather was hot, they were hot. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to firm up the structure and then to plaster it inside and outside.” </p>



<hr>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>At that time the dwellings did not have windows. It was hard to see and the dwellings were smelly. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow three kinds of windows: railing windows, lattice windows, and windows with bars.” </p>

<p>Squirrels and bats entered the dwellings through the gaps in the windows. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow a cloth-cover.” </p>

<p>The squirrels and bats entered in the gaps around the cloth cover. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow window shutters.” </p>



<hr>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>At that time the monks lay down on the ground. They became dirty, as did their robes. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow straw mats.” </p>

<p>The straw mats were eaten by rats and termites. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow a bench.” </p>

<p>It was painful to lie on the bench. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow a wicker bed.” </p>

<h4>1.2 The allowance for beds and benches </h4>

<p><p id="p16-17"><span class="parno">16-17</span>Soon afterwards the Saṅgha was offered, from a charnel ground, various kinds of beds with legs and frame. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered various kinds of benches with legs and frame. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow benches with detachable legs.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>The Saṅgha was offered a square bench. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow square benches.” </p>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a tall square bench. </p>

<p class="rule">“I also allow tall square benches.” </p>


<p>The Saṅgha was offered a sofa. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow sofas.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a high sofa. </p>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a cane bench. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“I allow cane benches.” </p>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a small bench bound with cloth. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow small benches bound with cloth.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a bench with ram-like legs. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow benches with ram-like legs.” </p>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a bench with many legs. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow benches with many legs.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a plank as a bench. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow plank benches.” </p>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a stool. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow stools.” </p>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a bench made of straw. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow benches made of straw.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>At that time the monks from the group of six lay down on high beds. When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them: “They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not lie down on high beds. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>Soon afterwards a monk was bitten by a snake while lying on a low bed. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow bed supports.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>The monks from the group of six used high bed supports, and they then made the bed shake. When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them: “They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>The Saṅgha was offered string. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to wrap the beds with string.” </p>

<p>The limbs of the bed took up a lot of string. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to perforate the limbs and wrap with a cross-weaving.” </p>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a cloth. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to make a mat underlay.” </p>

<p>The Saṅgha was offered a cotton-down quilt. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to remove the cotton down and make pillows. There are three kinds of cotton down: cotton down from trees, cotton down from creepers, and cotton down from grass.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>The monks from the group of six used large pillows, half the size of the body. When people walking about the dwellings saw this, they complained and criticized them: “They are just like householders who indulge in worldly pleasures!” </p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>On one occasion in Rājagaha there was a hilltop fair. People prepared mattresses for the government officials: mattresses stuffed with wool, cloth, bark, grass, or leaves. When the fair was over, they removed the covers and took them away. The monks saw a large quantity of wool, cloth, bark, grass, and leaves abandoned on the ground. They told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“I allow you five kinds of mattresses: mattresses stuffed with wool, cloth, bark, grass, or leaves.” </p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>The Saṅgha was offered furniture cloth. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to cover the mattresses.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>The monks laid a bed mattress on a bench and a bench mattress on a bed. The mattresses split open. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow upholstered beds and upholstered benches.” </p>

<hr>

<p>They put out a mattress without underlay. They sank down. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to put down an underlay, then to spread out a mattress, and then to cover it.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The covers were removed and taken away. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to sprinkle them.” </p>

<p>They were still taken away. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to make multi-colored lines.” </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to make multi-colored lines by hand.” </p>

<p>They were still taken away. </p>

<h4>1.3 The allowance for the color white, etc. </h4>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>At that time the monastics of other religions had white beds, black floors, and red ocher walls. Many people went to see their beds. </p>

<h4>2.1 The account of Anāthapiṇḍika </h4>

<p id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>The householder Anāthapiṇḍika had a brother in law who was a wealthy merchant in Rājagaha. On one occasion when Anāthapiṇḍika went to Rājagaha on business, that merchant had invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day. The merchant was telling his slaves and workers to get up early, to cook rice and rice porridge, and to prepare various kinds of curry. Anāthapiṇḍika thought: “When I’ve arrived here before, this householder put down all his business to greet me. But this time he’s all over the place, telling his workers what to do. Is he preparing for a marriage or a great sacrifice, or has he invited King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and the army for a meal tomorrow?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p51"><span class="parno">51</span>When the merchant was finished with telling his workers what to do, he went up to Anāthapiṇḍika, greeted him, and sat down. Anāthapiṇḍika then told him what he had observed and asked him what was happening. </p>

<hr>

<p>The merchant replied: “I’m not preparing for a marriage, nor have I invited King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and the army. I’m preparing for a great sacrifice. I have invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for a meal tomorrow.” </p>

<p>“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?”  </p>

<hr>

<p>“I did.”  </p>

<p>“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?”  </p>

<p>“I did.”  </p>

<hr>

<p>“Did you say, ‘Buddha’?”  </p>
<hr>

<p>“I did.” </p>


<p>“It’s rare in the world to hear the word ‘Buddha’. Is it possible right now to go and visit that Buddha, that fully awakened and perfected one?” </p>

<p>“Now is the wrong time to visit the Buddha. Tomorrow will be the right time.” </p>

<hr>

<p>Because he lay down preoccupied with the Buddha “Tomorrow I will go and visit that Buddha, that fully awakened and perfected one!” he got up three times during the night thinking it was light. </p>

<p id="p52"><span class="parno">52</span>Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Sivaka gate, which was opened by spirits. Then, as he was leaving town, the light disappeared and darkness descended. Paralyzed with fear and getting goosebumps all over, he just wanted to turn back. But then the invisible spirit Sivaka spoke up: </p>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p53"><span class="parno">53</span>“A hundred elephants, a hundred horses,
			<br>A hundred carriages drawn by mules,
			<br>A hundred thousand girls
			<br>Wearing jeweled earrings—
			<br>None is worth a sixteenth part
			<br>Of a single step forward.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p54"><span class="parno">54</span>Go forward, householder, go forward!
			<br>Going forward is better for you than going back.”</p>
	</div>

<hr>

<p id="p55-58"><span class="parno">55-58</span>The light returned, the darkness disappeared, and his fear subsided. A second and a third time the light disappeared and he was paralyzed with fear, upon which the spirit proclaimed the same verses. And on both occasions the light returned, the darkness disappeared, and his fear subsided. </p>

<hr>

<p>Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Sītavana, the Cool Grove. Just then the Buddha was doing walking meditation outside, having got up early in the morning. When the Buddha saw Anāthapiṇḍika coming, he stepped down from the walking path, sat down on the prepared seat, and said: “Come, Sudatta.” Anāthapiṇḍika thought: “The Buddha is calling me by name!” and glad and joyful he went up to him, bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said: “Venerable Sir, I hope you have slept well.” </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p59"><span class="parno">59</span>“Indeed, he always sleeps well,
<br>The brahmin who is extinguished,
<br>Who’s not soiled among worldly pleasures,
<br>But is cool and ownerless.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p60"><span class="parno">60</span>After cutting all attachments,
<br>After removing distress from the heart,
<br>Calmed, he sleeps well,
<br>Having attained peace of mind.”</p>
</div>

<hr>

<p id="p61"><span class="parno">61</span>The Buddha then gave him a progressive talk on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, Anāthapiṇḍika experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p>He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it. He had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. He then said to the Buddha: </p>

<p>“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Saṅgha of monks. Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life. And please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Saṅgha of monks.” The Buddha consented by remaining silent. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p62"><span class="parno">62</span>Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. </p>



<p>The merchant heard that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for the meal on the following day. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p63"><span class="parno">63</span>And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika: “You’ve invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha, yet you’ve just arrived here. I’ll pay for it.” </p>

<p>“There’s no need. I have the means.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p64"><span class="parno">64</span>The householder association of Rājagaha heard that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day. And they said to Anāthapiṇḍika: “You’ve invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha, yet you’ve just arrived here. We’ll pay for it.” </p>

<p>“There’s no need, sirs. I have the means.” </p>



<p id="p65"><span class="parno">65</span>King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha heard that Anāthapiṇḍika had invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha for a meal on the following day. And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika: “You’ve invited the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha, yet you’ve just arrived here. I’ll pay for it.” </p>

<p>“There’s no need, sir. I have the means.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p66"><span class="parno">66</span>The following morning, in that wealthy merchant’s house, Anāthapiṇḍika had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to that merchant’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of monks. Anāthapiṇḍika then personally served the various kinds of fine food to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, Anāthapiṇḍika sat down to one side and said: “Sir, please spend the rainy-season residence at Sāvatthī together with the Saṅgha of monks.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Buddhas delight in solitude, householder.” </p>

<p>“I understand, Sir, I understand!” Then, after instructing, inspiring, and gladdening him with a teaching, the Buddha got up from his seat and left. After finishing his business in Rājagaha, Anāthapiṇḍika set out for Sāvatthī. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p67"><span class="parno">67</span>Now at that time Anāthapiṇḍika had many friends and acquaintances who listened to him. On his way to Sāvatthī he told people to make monasteries, to build dwellings, and to prepare offerings: “There’s a Buddha in the world! He’s been invited by me and will be traveling this way.” </p>

<p>And those people did as Anāthapiṇḍika had urged them to do. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p68"><span class="parno">68</span>After arriving at Sāvatthī, Anāthapiṇḍika searched all over the town for a place for the Buddha to stay, thinking: “Where might the Buddha stay that’s neither too far from habitation nor too close, that has good access roads, that’s easily accessible for people who seek him, that has few people during the day and is quiet at night, that’s free from chatter and offers solitude, a private resting place suitable for seclusion?” </p>

<p id="p69"><span class="parno">69</span>Anāthapiṇḍika saw that Prince Jeta’s park had all these qualities. He then went to Prince Jeta and said: “Sir, please give me your park to set up a monastery.” </p>

<p>“I wouldn’t give it away even if you covered the park with ten million coins.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s a deal!” </p>

<p>“No it isn’t.” </p>

<hr>

<p>They then asked judges to decide on the matter. They said: “Sir, since you gave a price, the park is sold.” </p>

<p>Anāthapiṇḍika then had gold coins brought out in carts and covered the Jeta Grove with ten million coins. </p>

<p>After yet another load had been brought out, there was still a small area near the gateway that was not covered. Anāthapiṇḍika told his people: “Go and get more coins. We’ll cover this area too.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p70"><span class="parno">70</span>But Prince Jeta thought: “This must be really worthwhile, seeing as he’s giving up so much money.” And he said to Anāthapiṇḍika: </p>

<p>“That’s enough; don’t cover that area. Let me keep it. It will be my gift.” </p>

<p>Anāthapiṇḍika thought: “Prince Jeta is a well-known person. It’s very beneficial that such well-known people gain confidence in this spiritual path.” And he granted that area to Prince Jeta. Prince Jeta then had a gateway built at that place. </p>

<p id="p71"><span class="parno">71</span>But Anāthapiṇḍika had dwellings build in the Jeta Grove, and yards, gateways, assembly halls, water-boiling sheds, food-storage huts, restrooms, walking-meditation paths, indoor walking-meditation paths, wells, well houses, saunas, sauna sheds, ponds, and roof-covers. </p>

<h4>2.2 Putting in charge of building work </h4>

<p id="p72"><span class="parno">72</span>When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Vesālī. When he eventually arrived, he stayed, in the hall with the peaked roof in the Great Wood. </p>

<p>At that time people were doing careful building work. And the monks who supervised the building work were respectfully supported with robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. Then a certain poor tailor thought: “It must be really worthwhile, seeing as these people do such careful building work. Why don’t I too do building work?” He then made a mixture of mud, made bricks out of it, and built a wall. But because of his lack of skill, the wall was not straight and it fell down. A second and a third time the same thing happened. </p>

<hr>

<p>He then complained and criticized the monks: “These Sakyan monastics teach and instruct only those who give them robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. They only supervise their building work. But since I’m poor, nobody teaches, instructs, or supervises me.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p73"><span class="parno">73</span>The monks heard the complaints of that poor tailor. They informed the Buddha, who gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You should put a monk in charge of the building work. </p>

<hr>

<p>The monk in charge of building work should make an effort to complete the dwellings as quickly as possible, and he should repair what is broken or damaged. </p>

<p>And he is to be put in charge like this. First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p74"><span class="parno">74</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should put monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so. This is the motion. </p>

<p id="p75"><span class="parno">75</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha puts monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so. Any monk who approves of putting monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p id="p76"><span class="parno">76</span>The Saṅgha has put monk so-and-so in charge of the building work relating to the dwelling of householder so-and-so. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” </p>

<h5>2.3 The instruction on the best seat, etc. </h5>

<p id="p77"><span class="parno">77</span>When the Buddha had stayed at Vesālī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. On that occasion the monks who were the pupils of the monks from the group of six went ahead of the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha and took possession of dwellings and beds, thinking: “This will be for our preceptors and teachers, and also for ourselves.” </p>

<p id="p78"><span class="parno">78</span>Venerable Sāriputta followed behind the Saṅgha. Being unable to get a bed—the dwellings and beds having all been taken—he sat down at the foot of a tree. After getting up early in the morning, the Buddha cleared his throat. Sāriputta, too, cleared his throat. </p>

<p>“Who is there?” </p>

<p>“It’s me, Venerable Sir, Sāriputta.” </p>

<p>“Why are you sitting here?” </p>

<p>Sāriputta told the Buddha what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p>Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks who are the pupils of the monks from the group of six did this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>The Buddha rebuked them … “How can they act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Monks, who deserves the best seat, the best water, and the best almsfood?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p79"><span class="parno">79</span>Some monks said: “Those who have gone forth from an aristocratic family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Others said: “Those who have gone forth from a brahmin family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Still others said: “Those who have gone forth from a householder family deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The experts on the discourses deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The experts on the Monastic Law deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The expounders of the Teaching deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who obtain the first absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who obtain the second absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who obtain the third absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who obtain the fourth absorption deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The stream-enterers deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The once-returners deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The nonreturners deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “The perfected ones deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who have attained the three true insights deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” Or: “Those who have attained the six direct knowledges deserve the best seat, water, and almsfood.” </p>

<p id="p80"><span class="parno">80</span>The Buddha then addressed the monks: “Once upon a time, monks, there was a great banyan tree on the slope of the Himalayas. Three friends lived near it: a partridge, a monkey, and an elephant. They were disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward one another. They thought, ‘If only we knew which one of us was the oldest. We would honor, respect, and esteem him, and we would wait for his instructions.’ </p>

<p id="p81"><span class="parno">81</span>The partridge and the monkey then asked the elephant, ‘What’s your first memory?’ </p>

<p>‘When I was a young, I stepped over this banyan tree, keeping it between my thighs, and the top shoots touched my belly. That’s my first memory.’ </p>

<p id="p82"><span class="parno">82</span>The partridge and the elephant asked the monkey, ‘What’s your first memory?’ </p>

<p>‘When I was a young, I sat on the ground and ate the top shoots of the banyan tree. That’s my first memory.’ </p>

<p id="p83"><span class="parno">83</span>The monkey and the elephant asked the partridge, ‘What’s your first memory?’ </p>

<p>‘In such and such a spot there was a great banyan tree. I ate one of its fruits and defecated here. This banyan tree has grown from that. Well then, I must be the oldest one.’ </p>

<p id="p84"><span class="parno">84</span>The monkey and the elephant said to the partridge, ‘You’re the oldest of us. We will honor, respect, and esteem you, and we’ll wait for your instructions.’ </p>

<p>The partridge had the monkey and the elephant take the five precepts, and he also undertook them himself. They were respectful, deferential, and courteous toward one another. And when they died, they were reborn in a happy, heavenly destination. In this way the spiritual life called <i lang="pi" translate="no">tittiriya</i> came to be. </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p85"><span class="parno">85</span>Those who respect the seniors,
<br>And who are learned in the Teaching,
<br>They are praised while still alive,
<br>And then go to a good destination.</p>
</div>



<p id="p86"><span class="parno">86</span>“Even those animals, monks, were respectful, deferential, and courteous toward one another. Having gone forth on this well-proclaimed spiritual path, will you look good if you are disrespectful, undeferential, and rude toward one another? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You should do these things according to seniority: bowing down, standing up, raising your joined palms, doing acts of respect, giving the best seat, giving the best water, and giving the best almsfood. </p>

<p class="rule">But what belongs to the Saṅgha should not be reserved according to seniority. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>2.4 Persons one should not pay respect to, etc. </h4>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">87</span>“Monks, you should not pay respect to these ten kinds of persons: one who has been given the full ordination after you; one who isn’t fully ordained; one who belongs to a different Buddhist sect who is senior to you, but who speaks contrary to the Teaching; a woman; a <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṇḍaka</i>; one who is on probation; one who deserves to be sent back to the beginning; one who deserves the trial period; one who is undertaking the trial period; or one who deserves rehabilitation. </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">88</span>You should pay respect to these three kinds of persons: one who has been given the full ordination before you; one who belongs to a different Buddhist sect who is senior to you and who speaks in accordance with the Teaching; and in this world with its gods, lords of death, and supreme beings, in this society with its monastics and brahmins, its gods and humans, you should pay respect to the Buddha, perfected and fully awakened.” </p>

<h4>2.5 The prohibition against reserving seats </h4>

<p id="p89"><span class="parno">89</span>At that time people prepared roof-covers, mats, and places to stay for the Saṅgha. The monks who were the pupils of the monks from the group of six, thought: “The Buddha has instructed that what belongs to the Saṅgha should not be reserved according to seniority. But he’s given no such instruction about what has merely been prepared for the Saṅgha.” They then went ahead of the Saṅgha headed by the Buddha and took possession of roof-covers, mats, and places to stay, thinking: “This will be for our preceptors and teachers, and also for ourselves.” </p>

<p>Venerable Sāriputta followed behind the Saṅgha. Being unable to get a place to stay—the roof-covers, the mats, and the places to stay having all been taken—he sat down at the foot of a tree. After getting up early in the morning, the Buddha cleared his throat. Sāriputta, too, cleared his throat. </p>

<p>“Who is there?” </p>

<p>“It’s me, Venerable Sir, Sāriputta.” </p>

<p>“Why are you sitting here?” </p>

<hr>

<p>Sāriputta told the Buddha what had happened. Soon afterwards the Buddha had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the monks who are the pupils of the monks from the group of six did this?” 
</p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“Even what has merely been prepared for the Saṅgha should not be reserved according to seniority. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>2.6 The allowance for what belongs to a householder </h4>

<p id="p90"><span class="parno">90</span>At that time people prepared high and luxurious resting places in the dining halls in inhabited areas, that is: a high couch, a luxurious couch, a long-fleeced woolen rug, a multi-colored woolen rug, a white woolen rug, a red woolen rug, a cotton-down quilt, a woolen rug decorated with the images of predatory animals, a woolen rug with long fleece on one side, a woolen rug with long fleece on both sides, a sheet of silk embroidered with gems, a silken sheet, a woolen rug like a dancers’ rug, an elephant-back rug, a horse-back rug, a carriage-seat rug, a rug made of black antelope hide, an excellent sheet made of <i lang="pi" translate="no">kadalī</i>-deer hide, a seat with a canopy, a seat with red cushions at each end. Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit on them. They told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“Apart from the high couch, the luxurious couch, and the cotton-down quilt, I allow you to sit down on what belongs to householders, but not to lie down on it.” </p>

<p id="p91"><span class="parno">91</span>At that time people prepared beds and benches upholstered with cotton down in the dining halls in inhabited areas. Being afraid of wrongdoing, the monks did not sit on them. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to sit down on what belongs to householders, but not to lie down on it.” </p>

<h4>2.7 The expression of appreciation for the Jeta Grove dwellings </h4>

<p id="p92"><span class="parno">92</span>Wandering on, the Buddha eventually arrived at Sāvatthī, where he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Park. Anāthapiṇḍika then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, please accept tomorrow’s meal from me together with the Saṅgha of monks.” The Buddha consented by remaining silent. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p93"><span class="parno">93</span>Knowing that the Buddha had consented, Anāthapiṇḍika got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. </p>

<p>The following morning Anāthapiṇḍika had various kinds of fine food prepared. He then had the Buddha informed that the meal was ready. The Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and went to Anāthapiṇḍika’s house, where he sat down on the prepared seat together with the Saṅgha of monks. Anāthapiṇḍika then personally served various kinds of fine food to the Saṅgha of monks headed by the Buddha. When the Buddha had finished his meal and had washed his hands and bowl, Anāthapiṇḍika sat down to one side and said: “Sir, what should I do in regard to the Jeta Grove?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“You should dedicate the Jeta Grove to the Saṅgha everywhere, present and future.” </p>

<p>“Yes.” And he did just that. </p>

<p id="p94"><span class="parno">94</span>The Buddha then expressed his appreciation with these verses: </p>

<hr>

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p95"><span class="parno">95</span>“Cold and heat are kept away,
			<br>And predatory animals too,

	</div>
	
	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p97"><span class="parno">97</span>Giving dwellings to the Saṅgha

	<div class="verse">
			<p id="p98"><span class="parno">98</span>Should build delightful dwellings

	<div class="verse">

	</div>

<p id="p100"><span class="parno">100</span>The Buddha then got up from his seat and left. </p>

<h4>2.8 Reservation of seats, etc. </h4>

<p id="p101"><span class="parno">101</span>On one occasion a certain government official who was an Ājīvaka disciple was offering a meal to the Saṅgha. Arriving late, Venerable Upananda the Sakyan made the nearest monk get up before he had finished his meal. There was an uproar in the dining hall. The official complained and criticized him: “How can the Sakyan monastics arrive late and make the nearest monk get up in the middle of his meal? There was an uproar in the dining hall. It’s impossible to eat as much as you like when you’re not seated.” </p>

<p id="p102"><span class="parno">102</span>The monks heard the complaints of the official, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him: “How could Upananda act like this?” They told the Buddha what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p>“Is it true, Upananda, that you acted like this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked him … </p>

<p>“Foolish man, how can you act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking him … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You should not make a monk get up who hasn’t finished his meal. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p class="rule">If you’re asked to get up, and you have already refused an invitation to eat more, you should say: “Please, go and get some water.” If the other goes, all is well. If not, you should properly swallow the mouthful and give the seat to the more senior monk. Under no circumstances should you block a more senior monk from a seat. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p id="p103"><span class="parno">103</span>On one occasion the monks from the group of six asked the sick monks to get up. The sick monks said: “We’re not able to get up; we’re sick.” </p>

<p>Saying: “We’ll make the venerables get up,” they took hold of them, lifted them up, and then released them when they were standing. The sick monks fainted and collapsed. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not make the sick get up. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p104"><span class="parno">104</span>The monks from the group of six took possession of the best beds, saying: “We’re sick and no one can make us get up.” </p>

<p class="rule">“You should give suitable beds to those who are sick.” </p>

<p id="p105"><span class="parno">105</span>The monks from the group of six used a pretext to reserve resting places. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not use a pretext to reserve a resting place. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p id="p106"><span class="parno">106</span>At that time the monks from the group of seventeen were repairing a large dwelling nearby, intending to stay there for the rainy season. The monks from the group of six saw this and said: “These monks from the group of seventeen are repairing a dwelling. Let’s throw them out.” But some of them said: “Let’s wait until they’ve finished repairing it.” </p>

<p>Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six said to those from the group of seventeen: “Leave, this dwelling is ours.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Shouldn’t you have told us beforehand? We would have repaired another one.” </p>

<p>“Doesn’t this dwelling belong to the Saṅgha?” </p>

<p>“Yes it does.” </p>

<p>“Well then, leave; this dwelling is ours.” </p>

<p>“The dwelling is large. You can stay here and so can we.” </p>

<p>But they said: “Leave, this dwelling is ours,” and they grabbed them by the neck and threw them out in anger. The monks from the group of seventeen cried. When other monks asked them why, they told them what had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p107"><span class="parno">107</span>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six angrily throw other monks out of a dwelling belonging to the Saṅgha?” </p>

<p>They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that you did this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked them … and after giving a teaching, he addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not, in anger, throw a monk out of a dwelling belonging to the Saṅgha. If you do, you should be dealt with according to the rule. You should allocate the dwellings.” </p>

<h4>2.9 The appointment of allocators of dwellings </h4>

<p id="p108"><span class="parno">108</span>The monks thought: “Who should allocate the dwellings?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“You should appoint a monk who has five qualities as the allocator of dwellings: he is not swayed by desire, ill will, confusion, or fear, and he knows which dwellings have and have not been allocated. And he should be appointed like this. </p>

<p id="p109"><span class="parno">109</span>First a monk should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p id="p110"><span class="parno">110</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings. This is the motion. </p>

<p id="p111"><span class="parno">111</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha appoints monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings.

<p id="p112"><span class="parno">112</span>The Saṅgha has appointed monk so-and-so as allocator of dwellings. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” </p>



<hr>

<p id="p113"><span class="parno">113</span>The allocators of dwellings thought: “How should we allocate the dwellings?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“First you should count the monks and the beds. You should then allocate one monk to each bed.” </p>

<p>When they were allocating the beds, there were beds left over. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You should allocate one monk to each dwelling.” </p>

<p>When they were allocating the dwellings, there were dwellings left over. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should allocate one monk to the yard of each dwelling.” </p>

<hr>

<p>When they were allocating the yards, there were yards left over. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should give out additional shares. If another monk arrives after the additional shares have been allocated, then if you’re unwilling, you need not give him a share.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p114"><span class="parno">114</span>On one occasion the monks allocated a dwelling to one who was outside the monastery zone. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not allocate a dwelling to one outside the monastery zone. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<p id="p115"><span class="parno">115</span>At that time, after accepting a dwelling, the monks reserved it at all times. </p>

<p class="rule">“After you have accepted a dwelling, you should not reserve it at all times. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to reserve it for the three months of the rainy-season residence, but not at other times.” </p>

<p id="p116"><span class="parno">116</span>The monks thought: “How many times are there for the allocation of dwellings?” </p>

<p>“There are three times for the allocation of dwellings: the first, the second, and when given up in between. The first allocation is on the day after the full moon of July. The second allocation is one month after the full moon of July. The allocation of what is given up in between the two is on the day after the invitation ceremony and is for the purpose of spending the next rains residence.” </p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>


<p id="p118"><span class="parno">118</span>On one occasion Venerable Upananda the Sakyan had accepted a dwelling at Sāvatthī, but then went to a certain village monastery, where he was also allocated a dwelling.

<p id="p132"><span class="parno">132</span>When the Buddha had stayed at Sāvatthī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Kīṭāgiri with a large saṅgha of five hundred monks, including Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. The monks Assaji and Punabbasuka heard about this and said: “Well, let’s share out all the dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha. Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are in the grip of bad desires. We won’t assign dwellings to them.” And they shared out all the dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha. </p>

<p id="p133"><span class="parno">133</span>The Buddha eventually arrived at Kīṭāgiri. And he said to a group of monks: </p>

<p>“Go to the monks Assaji and Punabbasuka and say, ‘The Buddha is coming with a large saṅgha of five hundred monks, including Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna. Assign dwellings to the Buddha, to the Saṅgha of monks, and to Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna.’” </p>

<hr>

<p>Saying: “Yes, Sir,” they did just that. </p>

<hr>

<p>The monks Assaji and Punabbasuka replied: “There are no dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha; they have all been shared out to us. The Buddha is welcome and he may stay wherever he likes. But Sāriputta and Mahāmoggallāna are in the grip of bad desires. We won’t assign dwellings to them.” </p>

<p>“So you have shared out the dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha?” </p>

<p>“Yes.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p134"><span class="parno">134</span>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: </p>

<p>“How can these monks share out dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that they did this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.”  The Buddha rebuked them: </p>

<p>“How can those foolish men share out the dwellings belonging to the Saṅgha? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">135</span>“There are five things not to be distributed, either to a saṅgha, a group, or an individual. Even if distributed, they are not actually distributed. If you distribute any of them, you commit a serious offense. </p>

<p id="p141"><span class="parno">141</span>When the Buddha had stayed at Kīṭāgiri for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Āḷavī. When he eventually arrived, he stayed at Aggāḷava Shrine. </p>

<p>At that time the monks of Āḷava put monks in charge of building work such as this: the mere filling of gaps, the mere plastering of walls, the mere hanging of doors, the mere making of bolt-receiving posts, the mere making of windows, the mere application of white coloring, the mere application of black coloring, the mere treatment with red ocher, the mere covering with a roof, the mere fastening of a roof, the mere fixing of cornices, the mere repair of what is defective or broken, the mere plastering of a floor; and they put monks in charge of building work for twenty years, for thirty years, for life; and they put monks in charge of building work for life on finished dwellings. </p>

<hr>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks at Āḷavī put monks in charge of such kinds of work?” 

They told the Buddha. … </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that they do this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>
