<h4>&nbsp;</h4>


<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at the Mallian town of Anupiyā. At this time a number of well-known young Sakyans had followed the Buddha in going forth. </p>

<p>The Sakyans Mahānāma and Anuruddha were brothers. Anuruddha had been brought up in great comfort. He had three stilt houses: one for the winter, one for the summer, and one for the rainy season. He spent the four months of the rainy season in the rainy-season house, attended on only by female musicians, never descending from that house. </p>

<hr>

<p>Mahānāma thought: “A number of well-known young Sakyans have just followed the Buddha in going forth, but no one from our household. Why don’t Anuruddha or I go forth?” </p>

<p>He then went to Anuruddha and told him what he had thought. Anuruddha replied:</p>

<hr>

<p>“I’ve been brought up in great comfort; I’m not able to go forth. You go forth.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Come then, and I’ll teach you the affairs of the household life. First you must plow the fields, then sow the seeds, irrigate, and drain, and then weed. Next you must cut the harvest, gather it together, and make sheaves. You must then thresh it, remove the straw and husk, and then winnow it before you bring it into storage. And next year you must do the same, and the next.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“But does the work never stop? I can’t see any end to it. When can you enjoy yourself with worldly pleasures, free from bother?” </p>

<p>“The work doesn’t stop and you won’t see any end of it. While the work was still unfinished, our fathers and grandfathers have all died.” </p>

<p>“Well then, you go ahead with the affairs of the household life. I’ll go forth into homelessness.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>Anuruddha then went to his mother and said: “Mom, I wish to go forth into homelessness. Please allow me.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Both of you, Anuruddha, my two sons, are dear and beloved to me. Even if you died I would lose you against my wishes. So how can I allow you to go forth into homelessness while you’re still living?” </p>

<p>A second time Anuruddha asked the same question and got the same reply. He then asked a third time. </p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>At that time the Sakyans were ruled by King Bhaddiya, who was a friend of Anuruddha’s. Anuruddha’s mother considered this and thought: “Bhaddiya won’t be able to go forth into homelessness.” And she said to Anuruddha: “If Bhaddiya the King of the Sakyans goes forth, then you too may go forth.” </p>

<p>Anuruddha then went to King Baddiya and said: “My going forth depends on yours.” </p>

<p>“Don’t worry about whether your going forth depends on mine or not. I’m with you. So just go forth when you like.” </p>

<p>“Come, let’s go forth together.” </p>

<p>“I’m not able to go forth. I’m not able to do what you do. What can I do? You go forth.” </p>

<p>“My mother told me that I may go forth only if you go forth. And then you said, ‘Don’t worry about whether your going forth depends on mine or not. I’m with you. So just go forth when you like.’ So come, let’s go forth together.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>At that time people spoke the truth, and so Bhaddiya said to Anuruddha: “Please wait seven years. Then we’ll go forth together.” </p>

<p>“That’s too long. I’m not able to wait for seven years.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Then wait six years … five years … four years … three years … two years … one year, and we’ll go forth together.” </p>

<p>“That’s too long. I’m not able to wait for one year.” </p>

<p>“Then wait seven months, and we’ll go forth together.” </p>

<p>“That’s too long. I’m not able to wait for seven months.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Then wait six months … five months … four months … three months … two months … one month … half a month, and we’ll go forth together.” </p>

<p>“That’s too long. I’m not able to wait for half a month.” </p>

<p>“Then wait seven days, while I hand over the rulership to my sons and brothers.” </p>

<p>“Seven days isn’t long. I’ll wait.” </p>



<hr>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>Soon afterwards King Bhaddiya, Anuruddha, Ānanda, Bhagu, Kimila, and Devadatta, with the barber Upāli as the seventh, went out to the park with the fourfold army, just as they used to. After going a good distance, they turned back the army. They then entered a foreign territory, removed their ornaments, bound them in a bundle with an upper robe, and said to Upāli: “Now turn back, Upāli. This is enough for you to live on.” As Upāli was returning, he thought: “The Sakyans are temperamental. Thinking that I’m responsible for the departure of these young men, they might have me killed. Now, if these young Sakyans are going forth into homelessness, why shouldn’t I?” </p>

<hr>

<p>Undoing the bundle, he hung the goods from a tree, saying: “Whoever sees this may take it as given.” And he returned to the young Sakyans. </p>

<p>Seeing Upāli coming, they said to him: “Why are you coming back, Upāli?” </p>

<p>And he told what he had done. </p>

<hr>

<p>“You have done the right thing. The Sakyans are indeed temperamental. Thinking that you were responsible for our departure, they might have killed you.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Then the young Sakyans, taking Upāli with them, went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: </p>

<p>“Venerable Sir, we Sakyans are proud. This barber Upāli has been serving us for a long time. Please let him go forth first. We will then bow down to him, rise up for him, raise our joined palms to him, and do acts of respect toward him. In this way our Sakyan pride will be subdued.” </p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>And the Buddha had Upāli go forth first, and afterwards the young Sakyans. </p>

<p>During that very rainy season Venerable Bhaddiya realized the three insights, Venerable Anuruddha obtained clairvoyance, Venerable Ānanda realized stream-entry, whereas Devadatta obtained supernormal powers, but no stage of awakening. </p>



<hr>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>When Bhaddiya was in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, he frequently uttered a heartfelt exclamation: “Oh, what happiness! Oh, what happiness!” </p>

<hr>

<p>A number of monks went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and told him what was happening, adding: “No doubt Bhaddiya is dissatisfied with the spiritual life. It’s because he’s recalling his former happiness as a king that he is saying this.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>The Buddha addressed a certain monk: “Go, monk, and in my name say to Bhaddiya, ‘Bhaddiya, the Teacher is calling you.’” </p>

<p>Saying: “Yes, Sir,” he did just that. </p>

<hr>

<p>Bhaddiya consented. He then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. And the Buddha said to him: “Is it true, Bhaddiya, that when you’re in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, you frequently utter a heartfelt exclamation: ‘Oh, what happiness! Oh, what happiness!’?” </p>

<p>“Yes, Venerable Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“But why do you say this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“In the past, when I was a king, I was well protected within and outside the royal compound, within and outside of town, and within and outside of the country. But although I was protected and guarded in this way, I was fearful, agitated, and distrustful. But now, Sir, when I’m in the wilderness, at the foot of a tree, or in an empty dwelling, I’m free from fear, agitation, and distrust. I’m free from bother, relaxed, living on what’s given by others, with a mind as free as a wild animal. This is why I say this.” </p>

<p>Seeing the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>“They who have no anger within,
<br>Gone beyond any kind of existence,
<br>Happy, free from fear and sorrow—
<br>Even the gods are unable to see them.”</p>
</div>

<h4>1.2 The account of Devadatta </h4>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>When the Buddha had stayed at Anupiyā for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Kosambī. When he eventually arrived, he stayed in Ghosita’s Monastery. </p>

<p>Then, while reflecting in private, Devadatta thought: “Who might I inspire to have confidence in me, so that I’d get much gain and honor?” And it occurred to him: “Prince Ajātasattu is young and has a bright future. Why don’t I inspire him to have confidence in me? I’ll then get much gain and honor.” </p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>Devadatta put his dwelling in order, took his bowl and robes, and left for Rājagaha, where he eventually arrived. He then transformed himself into a boy wearing a snake as a belt and appeared on Prince Ajātasattu’s lap. When Ajātasattu became fearful and agitated, Devadatta said to him: “Are you afraid of me, Prince?” </p>

<p>“I am. Who are you?” </p>

<p>“I’m Devadatta.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“If you are Venerable Devadatta, then please appear in your own form.” Devadatta abandoned the form of a boy and then stood in front of Ajātasattu, wearing his robes and carrying his bowl. </p>

<p>By means of this wonder Devadatta was able to inspire Ajātasattu to have confidence in him. Ajātasattu then attended on him morning and evening, with five hundred carriages and a meal offering of five hundred dishes of food. Overcome by gain, honor, and fame, Devadatta started desiring to lead the Saṅgha of monks. But with the appearance of that thought, his supernormal powers disappeared. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>At that time Kakudha the Koḷiyan, the attendant to Venerable Mahāmoggallāna, had recently died and been reborn in a mind-made body. He had acquired a body two or three times the size of the fields of a Magadhan village. Yet he harmed neither himself nor others with that body. </p>

<hr>

<p>Soon afterwards the god Kakudha approached Mahāmoggallāna, bowed down, and told him about Devadatta’s desire and the disappearance of his supernormal powers. He then bowed down, circumambulated Mahāmoggallāna with his right side toward him, and disappeared on the spot. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>Mahāmoggallāna then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and told him all that had happened. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>The Buddha said: “But, Moggallāna, have you read Kakudha’s mind so that you know that all he says is just so and not otherwise?” </p>

<p>“I have, Venerable Sir.” </p>

<p>“Remember these words, Moggallāna! Soon that fool will show himself as he truly is. </p>

<h4>1.3 Discussion of the five kinds of teachers </h4>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>“Moggallāna, there are five kinds of teachers in the world. </p>

<p>One kind of teacher is impure in behavior, while claiming it is pure. His disciples know about his impure behavior, but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. How then can we inform them? He will be known through his own actions.’ The disciples conceal the impure behavior of such a teacher. And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it. </p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>Another kind of teacher is impure in livelihood, while claiming it is pure. His disciples know about his impure livelihood, but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. How then can we inform them? He will be known through his own actions.’ The disciples conceal the impure livelihood of such a teacher. And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it. </p>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>Still another kind of teacher gives impure teachings, while claiming they are pure. His disciples know about his impure teachings, but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. How then can we inform them? He will be known through his own actions.’ The disciples conceal the impure teachings of such a teacher. And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal them. </p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>Still another kind of teacher gives impure explanations, while claiming they are pure. His disciples know about his impure explanations, but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. How then can we inform them? He will be known through his own actions.’ The disciples conceal the impure explanations of such a teacher. And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal them. </p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>Still another kind of teacher has impure knowledge and vision, while claiming they are pure. His disciples know about his impure knowledge and vision, but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. How then can we inform them? He will be known through his own actions.’ The disciples conceal the impure knowledge and vision of such a teacher. And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it. </p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>But in my case, Moggallāna, I claim my behavior is pure because it is. My disciples don’t conceal my behavior and I don’t expect them to do so. I claim my livelihood is pure … I claim my teachings are pure … I claim my explanations are pure … I claim my knowledge and vision are pure because they are. My disciples don’t conceal my knowledge and vision and I don’t expect them to do so.” </p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>When the Buddha had stayed at Kosambī for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Rājagaha. When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. Then a number of monks went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said:</p>

<p>“Venerable Sir, Prince Ajātasattu attends on Devadatta morning and evening, with five hundred carriages and a meal offering of five hundred dishes of food.” </p>

<p>“Don’t envy Devadatta, monks, his gain, honor, and fame. So long as Prince Ajātasattu treats him like this, Devadatta can be expected to decline in good qualities. </p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>Just as a fierce dog would get even more fierce if you break a gall bladder on its nose, so too, so long as Prince Ajātasattu treats him like this, Devadatta can be expected to decline in good qualities. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame will cause his destruction and ruin. </p>

<p id="p25"><span class="parno">25</span>Just as a plantain banana tree produces fruit to its own destruction and ruin, so too will Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin. </p>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>Just as a bamboo produces fruit to its own destruction and ruin, so too will Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin. </p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>Just as a <i lang="pi" translate="no">naḷa</i> reed produces fruit to its own destruction and ruin, so too will Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin. </p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>Just as a mule becomes pregnant to its own destruction and ruin, so too will Devadatta’s gain, honor, and fame cause his own destruction and ruin.” </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>“The fruit destroys the plantain,
<br>And the bamboo and the reed.

<h4>2.1 The legal procedure of announcement </h4>

<p id="p31"><span class="parno">31</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha was seated giving a teaching surrounded by a large gathering of people, including the King. Then Devadatta got up from his seat, put his upper robe over one shoulder, raised his joined palms, and said: “Venerable Sir, you’re now old and close to the end of your life. You should live free from bother and enjoy the happiness of the present life. Hand the Saṅgha of monks over to me. Let me lead the Saṅgha.” </p>

<p>“Let it be, Devadatta, don’t think of leading the Saṅgha of monks.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p32"><span class="parno">32</span>A second time Devadatta said the same thing and got the same reply. He then said it a third time, 
and the Buddha replied: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p33"><span class="parno">33</span>“I wouldn’t even hand the Saṅgha over to Sāriputta and Mogallāna, so why then to you, a wretched devourer of junk?” </p>

<p>Devadatta thought: “The Buddha disparages me in front of a gathering that includes the king as a devourer of junk, while praising Sāriputta and Mogallāna,” and he bowed down in anger, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. </p>

<p>This was the first time Devadatta had ill will toward the Buddha. </p>



<hr>

<p id="p34"><span class="parno">34</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“Well then, the Saṅgha should do a legal procedure to make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha like this: ‘Devadatta’s character has changed. Whatever Devadatta now does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha, but only with Devadatta.’ And it should be done in this way. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p id="p35"><span class="parno">35</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should do a legal procedure to make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha like this: “Devadatta’s character has changed. Whatever Devadatta now does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha, but only with Devadatta.” This is the motion. </p>

<hr>

<p>Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha does a legal procedure to make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha like this: </p>

<p id="p36"><span class="parno">36</span>“Devadatta’s character has changed. Whatever Devadatta now does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha, but only with Devadatta.” Any monk who approves of doing a legal procedure to make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha “Devadatta’s character has changed. Whatever Devadatta now does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha, but only with Devadatta" should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p>The Saṅgha has done a legal procedure to make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha like this: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p37"><span class="parno">37</span>“Devadatta’s character has changed. Whatever Devadatta now does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha, but only with Devadatta.” The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” </p>



<p id="p38"><span class="parno">38</span>And the Buddha addressed Sāriputta: “Well then, Sāriputta, make that announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha.” </p>

<p>“Previously, Venerable Sir, I have praised Devadatta in Rājagaha, saying, ‘The Godhian is powerful and mighty.’ How then can I now make this announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha?” </p>

<p>“Didn’t you truthfully praise Devadatta in Rājagaha when you said that?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Yes.” </p>

<p>“In the same way, you should truthfully make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Yes, Sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p39"><span class="parno">39</span>And the Buddha addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“Well then, the Saṅgha should appoint Sāriputta to make that announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha. 
And he should be appointed like this. First Sāriputta should be asked, and then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should appoint Venerable Sāriputta to make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha like this: </p>

<p id="p41"><span class="parno">41</span>“Devadatta’s character has changed. Whatever Devadatta now does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha, but only with Devadatta.” Any monk who approves of appointing Venerable Sāriputta to make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha “Devadatta’s character has changed. Whatever Devadatta now does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha, but only with Devadatta” should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p>The Saṅgha has appointed Venerable Sāriputta to make an announcement about Devadatta in Rājagaha like  this: </p>

<p id="p42"><span class="parno">42</span>“Devadatta’s character has changed. Whatever Devadatta now does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha, but only with Devadatta.” The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I’ll remember it thus.’” </p>



<p id="p43"><span class="parno">43</span>When he had been appointed, Sāriputta entered Rājagaha accompanied by a number of monks. He then made that announcement about Devadatta: </p>

<p>“Devadatta’s character has changed. Whatever Devadatta now does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha, but only with Devadatta.” The foolish people there, those with little faith and confidence, said: “These Sakyan monastics are envious of Devadatta’s gain and honor.” But the wise ones, those with faith and confidence, said: “This must be a serious matter, seeing as the Buddha has had an announcement made about Devadatta in Rājagaha.” </p>

<h4>2.2 The account of Prince Ajātasattu </h4>

<p id="p44"><span class="parno">44</span>Soon afterwards Devadatta went to Prince Ajātasattu and said: “Formerly, Prince, people were long-lived, but now they are short-lived. It’s possible that you might die while still a prince. So kill your father and become the King. And I’ll kill the Buddha and become the Buddha.” </p>

<p id="p45"><span class="parno">45</span>Ajātasattu thought: “Venerable Devadatta is powerful and mighty. He would know.” So he bound a dagger to his thigh and, fearful and agitated, he hastily entered the royal compound in the middle of the day. The officials in the royal compound saw Ajātasattu’s strange behavior and seized him. When they examined him, they found the dagger tied to his thigh. They asked him what he was up to. </p>

<hr>

<p>“I want to kill my father.” </p>

<p>“Who has instigated you?” </p>

<p>“Venerable Devadatta.” </p>

<hr>

<p>Some officials opined: “The Prince should be executed, as well as Devadatta and all the monks.” Others opined: “The monks should not be executed; they haven’t done anything wrong. The Prince should be executed, as well as Devadatta.” Others again opined: “Neither the Prince nor Devadatta nor the monks should be executed. The King should be informed, and we should do as he says.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p46"><span class="parno">46</span>Taking Ajātasattu with them, they went to King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha and informed him of what had happened. The King said: “What do you all think?” And they told him their views. </p>

<hr>

<p>The King said: “What has this to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Saṅgha? Didn’t the Buddha have an announcement made in Rājagaha as a warning: ‘Devadatta’s character has changed. Whatever Devadatta now does by body or speech has nothing to do with the Buddha, the Teaching, or the Saṅgha, but only with Devadatta’?” </p>

<p>And he fired those officials who had suggested to execute the Prince, Devadatta, and the Saṅgha; he demoted those who had suggested to execute the Prince and Devadatta; and he promoted those who had suggested to act according to the King’s orders. </p>

<hr>

<p>The King then said to Ajātasattu: “Why do you want to kill me?” </p>

<p>“I want to rule, sir.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“If you want to rule, the kingdom is yours.” And he handed the rulership over to the Prince. </p>

<h4>2.3 The sending of assassins </h4>

<p id="p47"><span class="parno">47</span>Soon afterwards Devadatta went to Ajātasattu and said: </p>

<p>“Great king, tell your men to kill the ascetic Gotama.” And the King told his men: “Do as Venerable Devadatta says.” </p>

<p>Devadatta then told one man: “Go to such and such a place where the ascetic Gotama is staying. Kill him and return via this path.” On that path he stationed two men, saying: “Kill the man who comes along this path and return via that path.” On that path he stationed four men, saying: “Kill the two men who come along this path and return via that path.” On that path he stationed eight men, saying: “Kill the four men who come along this path and return via that path.” On that path he stationed sixteen men, saying: “Kill the eight men who come along this path and then return.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p48"><span class="parno">48</span>Soon afterwards that one man took a sword and shield, secured a bow and arrows on his back, and went to the Buddha. When he got close, he became fearful and agitated, his body rigid. The Buddha saw him and said: “Come, don’t be afraid.” </p>

<p>He then placed his sword and shield to one side, put down his bow and arrows, and went up to the Buddha. He bowed down with his head at the Buddha’s feet, and said: </p>

<p>“Sir, I’ve made a mistake. I’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful in coming here with an evil mind intent on murder. Please forgive me so that I may restrain myself in the future.” </p>

<p>“You have certainly made a mistake. You’ve been foolish, confused, and unskillful. But since you acknowledge your mistake and make proper amends, I forgive you. For this is called growth in the training of the noble ones: acknowledging a mistake, making proper amends, and undertaking restraint for the future.” </p>

<p id="p49"><span class="parno">49</span>The Buddha then gave him a progressive talk on generosity, morality, and heaven; on the danger, degradation, and defilement of worldly pleasures; and he revealed the benefits of renunciation. When the Buddha knew that his mind was ready, supple, without hindrances, joyful, and confident, he revealed the teaching unique to the Buddhas: suffering, its origin, its end, and the path. And just as a clean and stainless cloth absorbs dye properly, so too, while he was sitting right there, that man experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p>He had seen the Truth, had reached, understood, and penetrated it. He had gone beyond doubt and uncertainty, had attained to confidence, and had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. And he said to the Buddha:</p>

<p>“Wonderful, Sir, wonderful! Just as one might set upright what had been overturned, or reveal what was hidden, or show the way to one who was lost, or bring a lamp into the darkness so that one with eyes might see what’s there just so has the Buddha made the Teaching clear in many ways. I go for refuge to the Buddha, the Teaching, and the Saṅgha of monks. Please accept me as a lay follower who has gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha then said to him: “Don’t go back along this path, go along that one.” And he sent him down a different path. </p>

<p id="p50"><span class="parno">50</span>The two men thought: “Why is it taking that one man so long to arrive?” As they were walking along that path in the opposite direction, they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree. They approached him, bowed, and sat down. And the Buddha gave them a progressive talk … and they had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha: “Wonderful, Sir … Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p>The Buddha then said to them: “Don’t go back along this path, go along that one.” And he sent them down a different path. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p51"><span class="parno">51</span>The four men … the eight men … the sixteen men thought: “Why is it taking those eight men so long to arrive?” As they were walking along that path in the opposite direction, they saw the Buddha seated at the foot of a tree. They approached him, bowed, and sat down. And the Buddha gave them a progressive talk … and they had become independent of others in the Teacher’s instruction. They then said to the Buddha: “Wonderful, Sir … Please accept us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life.” </p>

<p></p>

<p id="p52"><span class="parno">52</span>Soon afterwards that one man went to Devadatta and said: “I wasn’t able to kill him, Sir. He’s powerful and mighty, that Buddha.” </p>

<p>“Forget it. Don’t kill the ascetic Gotama. I’ll do it myself.” </p>

<h4>2.4 The act of causing the Buddha to bleed </h4>

<p id="p53"><span class="parno">53</span>Soon afterwards the Buddha was doing walking meditation in the shade of the Vulture Peak. Devadatta climbed the peak and threw down a large stone, thinking: “With this I’ll kill the ascetic Gotama.” But the stone got stuck in the junction of two outcrops. A chip flew off, hitting the Buddha’s foot and causing it to bleed. The Buddha looked up and said to Devadatta: “Foolish man, you have made much demerit. With an evil mind intent on murder you have made the Buddha bleed.” Soon afterwards the Buddha addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“With an evil mind intent on murder Devadatta has made the Buddha bleed. This is his first action with consequences in his very next life.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p54"><span class="parno">54</span>When the monks heard that Devadatta was trying to murder the Buddha, they walked back and forth on all sides of the Buddha’s dwelling, trying to protect the Buddha by reciting loudly. The Buddha heard that loud sound of recitation. He asked Ānanda what it was and Ānanda told him. </p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha said: “Well then, Ānanda, tell those monks in my name that the Teacher is calling them.” <br>

<br>Saying: “Yes, Sir,” he did just that. The monks consented. They then went to the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. <br>

<br>The Buddha said to them: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p55-56"><span class="parno">55-56</span>“It’s impossible, monks, for anyone to kill me through an act of violence. The Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violence. </p>

<hr>

<p>“Monks, there are five kinds of teachers in the world. </p>

<p>One kind of teacher is impure in behavior, while claiming it is pure. </p>

<p id="p57"><span class="parno">57</span>His disciples know about his impure behavior, but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. How then can we inform them? He will be known through his own actions.’ The disciples conceal the impure behavior of such a teacher. And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it. </p>

<hr>

<p>Another kind of teacher is impure in livelihood … gives impure teachings … gives impure explanations … has impure knowledge and vision, while claiming they are pure. His disciples know about his impure knowledge and vision, but think, ‘It would be unpleasant for him if we inform the householders. Yet it’s because of him that we’re honored with gifts of robe-cloth, almsfood, dwellings, and medicinal supplies. How then can we inform them? He will be known through his own actions.’ The disciples conceal the impure knowledge and vision of such a teacher. And the teacher expects his disciples to conceal it. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p58"><span class="parno">58</span>But in my case, I claim my behavior is pure because it is. My disciples don’t conceal my behavior and I don’t expect them to do so. I claim my livelihood is pure … I claim my teachings are pure … I claim my explanations are pure … I claim my knowledge and vision are pure because they are. My disciples don’t conceal my knowledge and vision and I don’t expect them to do so. </p>

<p>It’s impossible for anyone to kill me through an act of violence. The Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violence. Go to your dwellings, monks. I don’t need any protection.” </p>

<h4>2.5 The letting loose of Nāḷāgiri </h4>

<p id="p59"><span class="parno">59</span>At that time in Rājagaha there was a violent elephant called Nāḷāgiri, a killer of humans. Devadatta then entered Rājagaha, went to the elephant stables, and said to the elephant keepers: “We who are relatives of the King are capable of having people promoted and getting them a raise. So then, when the ascetic Gotama comes walking along this street, release the elephant Nāḷāgiri down this same street.” </p>

<p>“Yes, Sir.” </p>

<p>One morning soon afterwards, the Buddha robed up, took his bowl and robe, and entered Rājagaha for alms together with a number of monks. And the Buddha walked down that very street. When the elephant keepers saw the Buddha coming, they released Nāḷāgiri down the same street. Nāḷāgiri saw the Buddha coming. He blew his trunk, and with ears and tail bristling, he charged toward the Buddha. When the monks saw Nāḷāgiri coming, they said to the Buddha: </p>

<p>“This elephant coming down the street is Nāḷāgiri, a violent killer of humans. Please retreat, Sir.” </p>

<p>“Come, don’t be afraid. It’s impossible for anyone to kill the Buddha through an act of violence. The Buddha will not attain final extinguishment through an act of violence.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p60"><span class="parno">60</span>A second time and a third time those monks said the same thing to the Buddha, each time getting the same reply. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p61"><span class="parno">61</span>On that occasion people had ascended their stilt houses and even their roofs. The foolish people with little faith and confidence said: “The elephant will hurt the handsome great ascetic.” But the wise people with faith and confidence said: “Soon the great man and the great elephant will meet in battle.” </p>

<p>The Buddha then pervaded Nāḷāgiri with a mind of love. Feeling it, Nāḷāgiri lowered his trunk, went up to the Buddha, and stood in front of him. And while stroking Nāḷāgiri on the forehead with his right hand, the Buddha spoke these verses: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p62"><span class="parno">62</span>“Do not, elephant, attack a great man;
<br>Painful it is to attack a great man.
<br>For a killer of a great man,
<br>The next rebirth is not good.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p63"><span class="parno">63</span>Don’t be intoxicated or heedless,
<br>For the heedless are not reborn well.
<br>Only do those things
<br>That will take you to a good rebirth.”</p>
</div>

<p id="p64"><span class="parno">64</span>Nāḷāgiri sucked the dust from the Buddha’s feet with his trunk and scattered it overhead. He then walked backward while looking at the Buddha and returned to his own spot in the elephant stables. That is how tame Nāḷāgiri had become. On that occasion people chanted this verse: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p65"><span class="parno">65</span>“Some are tamed with sticks
<br>And with goads and whips.
<br>Without stick or sword,
<br>The great sage tamed the elephant.”</p>
</div>

<p id="p66"><span class="parno">66</span>And people complained and criticized him: “How evil he is, this Devadatta, how doomed he is, in that he tries to kill the ascetic Gotama so powerful and mighty.” Devadatta’s gain and honor declined, whereas those of the Buddha increased. </p>

<h4>2.6 The account of the request for the five points </h4>

<p id="p67"><span class="parno">67</span>Because of decline in material support and loss of respect, Devadatta and his followers were only invited to meals after repeatedly asking. People complained and criticized them:</p>

<p>“How can the Sakyan monastics eat at invitations after repeatedly asking? Who doesn’t like nice food? Who doesn’t prefer tasty food?” </p>

<p>The monks heard the complaints of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized those monks: “How can Devadatta and his followers eat at invitations after repeatedly asking?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned Devadatta: </p>

<p>“Is it true, Devadatta, that you do this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking him … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well then, for monks eating among families I’ll lay down a rule against eating in groups of more than three, for these three reasons: for the restraint of bad people; for the ease of good monks, stopping those with bad desires from creating a faction and then splitting the Saṅgha; and out of compassion for families. Anyone eating in a group is to be dealt with according to the rule.” </p>



<hr>

<p id="p68"><span class="parno">68</span>Soon afterwards Devadatta went to see Kokālika, Kaṭamodakatissaka, Khaṇḍadeviyā-putta, and Samuddadatta, and he said to them: “Let’s cause a schism in the Saṅgha of the ascetic Gotama. Let’s break its authority.” </p>

<p>Kokālika said to Devadatta: </p>

<p>“The ascetic Gotama is powerful and mighty. How can we achieve this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Well, let’s go to the ascetic Gotama and request five things: ‘In many ways, Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, self-effacement, ascetic practices, being inspiring, the reduction in things, and being energetic. And there are five things that lead to just that. </p>


<hr>

<p>It would be good, Sir, if the monks stayed in the wilderness for life, and whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offense; </p>

<p>If they ate only almsfood for life, and whoever accepts an invitational meal would commit an offense; </p>

<p>If they wore rag-robes for life, and whoever accepts robe-cloth from a householder would commit an offense; </p>

<p>If they live at the foot of a tree for life, and whoever takes shelter would commit an offense; </p>

<p>If they didn’t eat fish or meat for life, and whoever does would commit an offense.’ </p>


<p>The ascetic Gotama won’t allow this. We’ll then be able to win people over with these five points.” </p>

<p>Kokālika said: “It might be possible to cause a schism in the Saṅgha with these five points, for people have confidence in austerity.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p69"><span class="parno">69</span>Devadatta and his followers then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and Devadatta made his request.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Buddha replied: “No, Devadatta. Those who wish may stay in the wilderness and those who wish may live near an inhabited area. Those who wish may eat only almsfood and those who wish may accept invitations. Those who wish may wear rag-robes and those who wish may accept robe-cloth from householders. I have allowed the foot of a tree as resting place for eight months of the year, as well as fish and meat that are pure in three respects: one hasn’t seen, heard, or suspected that the animal was specifically killed to feed a monastic.” </p>

<p>Devadatta thought: “The Buddha doesn’t allow the five points,” and he was glad and elated. He got up from his seat, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left with his followers. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p70"><span class="parno">70</span>Devadatta then entered Rājagaha and won people over with the five points, saying: “The ascetic Gotama doesn’t agree to them, but we practice in accordance with them.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p71"><span class="parno">71</span>The foolish people there with little faith and confidence said: “These Sakyan monastics are practicing asceticism, and they live for the purpose of self-effacement. But the ascetic Gotama is extravagant and has chosen to live a life of indulgence.” But the wise people who had faith and confidence complained and criticized Devadatta: “How can Devadatta pursue schism in the Saṅgha of the Buddha? How can he break its authority?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p72"><span class="parno">72</span>The monks heard the criticism of those people, and the monks of few desires complained and criticized him in the same way. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p73"><span class="parno">73</span>They then told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned Devadatta: </p>

<p>“Is it true, Devadatta, that you are doing this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” </p>

<p>“Let it be, Devadatta, don’t cause a schism in the Saṅgha. Schism in the Saṅgha is a serious matter. Whoever causes a schism in a united Saṅgha, does a bad act with effect for an eon; he is boiled in hell for an eon. But whoever unites a divided Saṅgha, generates the supreme merit; he rejoices in heaven for an eon. So let it be, Devadatta, don’t cause a schism in the Saṅgha. Schism in the Saṅgha is a serious matter.” </p>



<p id="p74"><span class="parno">74</span>Soon afterwards, after robing up in the morning, Venerable Ānanda took his bowl and robe and entered Rājagaha for alms. When Devadatta saw him, he approached him, and said: “From today on, Ānanda, I’ll do the observance-day ceremony and the legal procedures of the Saṅgha separate from the Buddha and the Saṅgha of monks.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p75"><span class="parno">75</span>When Ānanda had walked for alms, after his meal and after returning from alms round, he went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and told him what had happened, adding: </p>

<p>“From today, Venerable Sir, Devadatta has caused a schism in the Saṅgha.” Understanding the significance of this, on that occasion the Buddha uttered a heartfelt exclamation: </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p76"><span class="parno">76</span>“For the good doing good is easy;
<br>For the bad doing good is hard;
<br>For the bad doing evil is easy;
<br>For the noble ones doing evil is hard.”</p>
</div>

<hr>

<h4>3.1 The account of schism in the Saṅgha </h4>

<p id="p78"><span class="parno">78</span>On the observance day soon afterwards, Devadatta got up from his seat and distributed ballots, saying: “We have gone to the ascetic Gotama and asked for five things: ‘In many ways, Sir, you praise fewness of wishes, contentment, the erasing of defilements, ascetic practices, being inspiring, the reduction in things, and being energetic. And there are five things that lead to just that. </p>

<hr>

<p>It would be good, Sir, if the monks stayed in the wilderness for life, and whoever stays near an inhabited area would commit an offense; </p>

<p>If they were alms-collectors for life, and whoever accepts an invitation would commit an offense; </p>

<p>If they were rag-robe wearers for life, and whoever accepts robe-cloth from a householder would commit an offense; </p>

<p>If they dwelt at the foot of a tree for life, and whoever takes shelter would commit an offense; </p>

<p>If they didn’t eat fish or meat for life, and whoever does would commit an offense.’ </p>


<hr>

<p>The ascetic Gotama doesn’t agree to them, but we practice in accordance with them. Any monk who approves of these five things should vote in favor.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p79"><span class="parno">79</span>On that occasion five hundred Vajjian monks from Vesālī, newly ordained and ignorant, were present. Thinking: “This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction,” they voted in favor. </p>

<p>Then, after causing a schism in the Saṅgha, Devadatta left for Gayāsīsa together with five hundred monks. </p>



<p>Soon afterwards Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, Devadatta has split the Saṅgha and left for Gayāsīsa together with five hundred monks.” </p>

<p>“You have compassion for those five hundred newly ordained monks, don’t you? Go then, Sāriputta and Moggallāna, before they are affected by misfortune and disaster.” </p>

<p>Saying: “Yes,” Sāriputta and Moggallāna got up from their seats, bowed down, circumambulated the Buddha with their right side toward him, and went to Gayāsīsa. </p>

<p id="p80"><span class="parno">80</span>Just then a certain monk who was standing near the Buddha was crying. The Buddha asked him why. </p>

<p>He replied: “Even Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the Buddha’s chief disciples, are going to Devadatta because they approve of his teaching.” </p>

<p>“It’s impossible for Sāriputta and Moggallāna to approve of Devadatta’s teaching. Instead, they’ve gone to win those monks over.” </p>



<hr>

<p id="p81"><span class="parno">81</span>On that occasion Devadatta was seated giving a teaching surrounded by a great gathering. When Devadatta saw Sāriputta and Moggallāna coming, he said to the monks: “See how well-taught my teaching is, in that even Sāriputta and Moggallāna, the ascetic Gotama’s chief disciples, are coming here because they approve of my teaching.” </p>

<p>But Kokālika said, </p>

<p>“Don’t trust Sāriputta and Moggallāna. They have bad desires. They are in the grip of bad desires.” </p>

<p>“Don’t worry. Anyone who comes to approve of my teaching is welcome.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p82"><span class="parno">82</span>Devadatta invited Venerable Sāriputta to sit on a seat half the height of his own. Saying:</p>

<p>“There’s no need,” Sāriputta took another seat and sat down to one side, as did Mahāmoggallāna. After spending most of the night instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the monks with a teaching, Devadatta invited Sāriputta, saying “The Saṅgha of monks is without dullness and drowsiness. Give a teaching, Sāriputta. My back is aching and I’ll stretch it.” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Yes.” </p>

<hr>

<p>Devadatta then folded his upper robe in four and lay down on his right side. Because he was tired, absentminded, and heedless, he fell asleep in an instant. </p>

<p id="p83"><span class="parno">83</span>Venerable Sāriputta then used the wonder of mind reading to instruct them, and Venerable Mahāmoggallāna used the wonder of supernormal powers to the same effect. While those monks were being instructed like this, they experienced the stainless vision of the Truth: “Anything that has a beginning has an end.” </p>

<p id="p84"><span class="parno">84</span>And Sāriputta addressed those monks: “Let’s go to the Buddha. Whoever approves of the teaching of the Buddha should come along.” Sāriputta and Moggallāna then went to the Bamboo Grove accompanied by those five hundred monks. </p>

<p>In the meantime Kokālika woke up Devadatta, saying: “Get up, Devadatta, your monks are being led away by Sāriputta and Moggallāna. Didn’t I tell you not to trust Sāriputta and Moggallāna? Didn’t I say that they have bad desires, that they are in the grip of bad desires?” And Devadatta vomited hot blood right there. </p>



<hr>

<p id="p85"><span class="parno">85</span>But Sāriputta and Moggallāna went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, it would be good if we could reordain the monks who sided with the schism.” </p>

<p>“Let it be, Sāriputta, don’t think of reordaining the monks who sided with the schism. Instead, have them confess a serious offense. And Devadatta, how did he treat you?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“Just as you, Sir, spend most of the night instructing, inspiring, and gladdening the monks with a teaching, and then invite me, saying, ‘The Saṅgha of monks is without dullness and drowsiness. Give a teaching, Sāriputta. My back is aching and I’ll stretch it,’ that’s how Devadatta treated us.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p86"><span class="parno">86</span>And the Buddha addressed the monks: </p>

<p>“Once upon a time there was a great lake in a wilderness area with elephants living nearby. They plunged into the lake, pulled up lotus roots and tubers with their trunks, gave them a good rinse to remove the mud, and then chewed and swallowed them. That gave them beauty and strength. And they didn’t die or experience death-like suffering because of that. </p>

<p>Then baby elephants tried to imitate those great elephants. They plunged into the lake, pulled up lotus roots and tubers with their trunks, but didn’t give them a good rinse to remove the mud, and then chewed and swallowed them while muddy. That didn’t give them any beauty or strength. And they died or experienced death-like suffering because of that. Just so, by imitating me, Devadatta will die miserably. </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p87"><span class="parno">87</span>‘While the great elephant removes the earth,
<br>Eats the tuber, and is alert in the rivers,
<br>He’s like a baby elephant that’s eaten mud:
<br>By imitating me, he will die miserably.’</p>
</div>



<hr>

<p id="p88"><span class="parno">88</span>“A monk who has eight qualities is qualified to act as messenger. He listens and communicates, he learns and remembers, he understands and gets things across, he’s skilled in what is and what isn’t relevant, he’s not argumentative. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p89"><span class="parno">89</span>Because he has these eight qualities, Sāriputta is qualified to act as messenger. </p>

<hr>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p90"><span class="parno">90</span>‘He doesn’t tremble when faced
<br>With a gathering of fierce debaters.
<br>He doesn’t mangle his words
<br>Or fail to get the instruction across.</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p id="p91"><span class="parno">91</span>He speaks with confidence
<br>And isn’t agitated when questioned.
<br>This kind of monk, indeed,
<br>Is qualified to act as messenger.’</p>
</div>



<hr>

<p id="p92"><span class="parno">92</span>“Because he is overcome by and immersed in eight bad qualities, Devadatta is irredeemably destined to an eon in hell. </p>

<p>Because Devadatta is overcome by and immersed in gain, lack of gain, fame, lack of fame, honor, lack of honor, bad desires, and bad friends, he is irredeemably destined to an eon in hell. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p93"><span class="parno">93</span>It’s good for a monk to overcome whatever gain he’s affected by, whatever lack of gain he’s affected by, whatever fame he’s affected by, whatever lack of fame he’s affected by, whatever honor he’s affected by, whatever lack of honor he’s affected by, whatever bad desires he’s affected by, or whatever bad friends he’s affected by. </p>

<p>For what reason should a monk overcome these things? </p>

<p>If he doesn’t overcome whatever gain he’s affected by, corruptions, distress, and fevers may arise. But if he overcomes whatever gain he’s affected by, he won’t have those corruptions, distress, and fevers. If he doesn’t overcome whatever lack of gain he’s affected by, whatever fame he’s affected by, whatever lack of fame he’s affected by, whatever honor he’s affected by, whatever lack of honor he’s affected by, whatever bad desires he’s affected by, or whatever bad friends he’s affected by, corruptions, distress, and fevers may arise. But if he overcomes whatever bad friends he’s affected by, he won’t have those corruptions, distress, and fevers. Therefore, monks, you should overcome whatever gain you’re affected by, whatever lack of gain you’re affected by, whatever fame you’re affected by, whatever lack of fame you’re affected by, whatever honor you’re affected by, whatever lack of honor you’re affected by, whatever bad desires you’re affected by, and whatever bad friends you’re affected by. It’s in this way you should train yourselves. </p>

<p id="p94"><span class="parno">94</span>Because he is overcome by and immersed in three bad qualities, Devadatta is irredeemably destined to an eon in hell. What three? Bad desires; bad friends; after minor success, he stopped short of the goal. </p>

<h4>3.2 Upāli’s questions </h4>

<p id="p102"><span class="parno">102</span>On one occasion Upāli went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and said: “Venerable Sir, we speak of ‘fracture in the Saṅgha’. But how is there fracture in the Saṅgha, yet not schism in the Saṅgha? And how is there both fracture  and schism in the Saṅgha?” </p>

<p id="p103"><span class="parno">103</span>“If, Upāli, there is one monk on one side and two on the other, and a fourth makes the proclamation and distributes ballots, saying, ‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ then this is a fracture in the Saṅgha, but not schism in the Saṅgha. </p>

<hr>

<p>If there are two monks on one side and two on the other, and a fifth makes the proclamation and distributes ballots, saying, ‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ then this is a fracture in the Saṅgha, but not schism in the Saṅgha. </p>

<p>If there are two monks on one side and three on the other, and a sixth makes the proclamation and distributes ballots, saying, ‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ then this is a fracture in the Saṅgha, but not schism in the Saṅgha. </p>

<p>If there are three monks on one side and three on the other, and a seventh makes the proclamation and distributes ballots, saying, ‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ then this is a fracture in the Saṅgha, but not schism in the Saṅgha. </p>

<p>If there are three monks on one side and four on the other, and an eighth makes the proclamation and distributes ballots, saying, ‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ then this is a fracture in the Saṅgha, but not schism in the Saṅgha. </p>

<p>But if there are four monks on one side and four on the other, and a ninth makes the proclamation and distributes ballots, saying, ‘This is the Teaching, this is the Monastic Law, this is the Teacher’s instruction; take this, approve of this,’ then this is both a fracture in the Saṅgha and also a schism in the Saṅgha. </p>


<hr>

<p class="rule">And if there are nine or more monks, then this is both a fracture in the Saṅgha and also a schism in the Saṅgha. </p>

<p>A nun cannot cause a schism in the Saṅgha, even if she makes an effort to cause a schism. A trainee nun, a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, or a female lay follower cannot cause a schism in the Saṅgha, even if she makes an effort to cause a schism. </p>
