<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time newly arrived monks entered the monastery wearing sandals, holding sunshades, with their heads covered, with their robes on their heads; and they washed their feet with drinking water, did not bow down to the more senior resident monks, and did not ask about dwellings. A certain newly arrived monk unlocked the bolt of an unoccupied dwelling, opened the door, and entered hastily. A snake fell from the top of the door frame onto his shoulders. Terrified, he screamed. The monks came running and asked why he was screaming. And he told them. </p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the newly arrived monks enter the monastery wearing sandals, holding sunshades, with their heads covered, with their robe on their head; and wash their feet with drinking water, not bow down to the more senior resident monks, and not ask about dwellings?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the newly arrived monks act like this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked them … </p>

<p>“How can the newly arrived monks act like this? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for newly arrived monks. </p>

<p>When a newly arrived monk enters a monastery, he should remove his sandals, hold them low, knock them together, and carry them along; he should lower his sunshade, uncover his head, and put his robe over his shoulders; he should then enter the monastery carefully and without hurry. As he enters the monastery, he should look out for where the resident monks gather whether it’s in the assembly hall, under a roof-cover, or at the foot of a tree and he should go there. He should then put his bowl and robe aside, and sit down on a suitable seat. He should ask which is the water for drinking and which the water for washing. If he needs water to drink, he may take some and drink. If he needs water to wash, he may take some and wash his feet. When he washes his feet, he should pour the water with one hand and wash with the other. He should not pour the water and wash his feet with the same hand. He should ask for a sandal-wiping cloth, and then wipe them. When he wipes his sandals, he should first wipe them with a dry cloth, then a wet one. He should wash the cloth and put it aside. </p>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>If a resident monk is more senior, the newly arrived monk should bow down to him. If a resident monk is more junior, he should bow down to the newly arrived monk. The newly arrived monk should ask which dwelling he may use and whether it’s occupied or not. He should ask about where to go for alms and where to avoid, about any families designated as “in training”, about the place for defecating and the place for urinating, about the water for drinking and the water for washing, about walking sticks, and about the Saṅgha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave. </p>

<p>If the dwelling is unoccupied, he should knock on the door, wait for a moment, then unlock the bolt, open the door, and look inside while standing outside. </p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>If the dwelling is dirty, and if beds or benches are stacked on top of one another with furniture in a pile on top, he should clean it if he is able. When he is cleaning the dwelling, he should first take out the floor cover and put it aside. He should take out the bed supports and put them aside. He should take out the mattress and the pillow and put them aside. He should take out the sitting mat and the sheet and put them aside. Holding the bed low, he should carefully take it out without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it aside. Holding the bench low, he should carefully take it out without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it aside. He should take out the spittoon and put it aside. He should take out the leaning board and put it aside. If the dwelling has cobwebs, he should first remove them from the ceiling cloth, and he should then wipe the windows and the corners of the room. If the walls have been treated with red ocher and they’re moldy, he should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe the walls. If the floor has been treated with a black finish and it’s moldy, he should moisten a cloth, wring it out, and wipe the floor. If the floor is untreated, he should sprinkle it with water and then sweep it, while trying to avoid stirring up dust. He should look out for any trash and discard it. </p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>He should sun the floor cover, clean it, beat it, bring it back inside, and put it back as before. He should sun the bed supports, wipe them, bring them back inside, and put them back where they were. He should sun the bed, clean it, and beat it. Holding it low, he should carefully bring it back inside without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put as before. He should sun the bench, clean it, and beat it. Holding it low, he should carefully bring it back inside without scratching it or knocking it against the door or the door frame, and he should put it back as before. He should sun the mattress and the pillow, clean them, beat them, bring them back inside, and put them back as before. He should sun the sitting mat and the sheet, clean them, beat them, bring them back inside, and put them back as before. He should sun the spittoon, wipe it, bring it back inside, and put it back where it was. He should sun the leaning board, wipe it, bring it back inside, and put it back where it was. </p>

<p>He should put away the bowl and robe. When putting away the bowl, he should hold the bowl in one hand, feel under the bed or the bench with the other, and then put it away. He shouldn’t put the bowl away on the bare floor. When putting away the robe, he should hold the robe in one hand, wipe the bamboo robe rack or the clothesline with the other, and then put it away by folding the robe over it, making the ends face the wall and the fold face out. </p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>If dusty winds are blowing from the east, he should close the windows on the eastern side. If dusty winds are blowing from the west, he should close the windows on the western side. If dusty winds are blowing from the north, he should close the windows on the northern side. If dusty winds are blowing from the south, he should close the windows on the southern side. If the weather is cold, he should open the windows during the day and close them at night. If the weather is hot, he should close the windows during the day and open them at night. </p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>If the yard is dirty, he should sweep it. If the gateway is dirty, he should sweep it. If the assembly hall is dirty, he should sweep it. If the water-boiling shed is dirty, he should sweep it. If the restroom is dirty, he should sweep it. If there is no water for drinking, he should get some. If there is no water for washing, he should get some. If there is no water in the rinsing pot, he should fill it. </p>

<p>This is the proper conduct for newly arrived monks.” </p>

<h4>2. Discussion of the proper conduct for resident monks </h4>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>At that time, when they saw newly arrived monks, the resident monks did not prepare seats, or put out foot stools, foot scrapers, or water for washing the feet. They did not go out to meet them to receive their bowls and robes, or ask if they wanted water to drink. They did not bow down to more senior newly arrived monks or assign dwellings to them. </p>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the resident monks act like this?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the resident monks are acting like this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for resident monks. </p>

<p>When a resident monk sees a newly arrived monk who is more senior, he should prepare a seat, and put out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should go out to meet him to receive his bowl and robe, and ask if he wants water to drink. If he is able, he should wipe his sandals, first with a dry cloth and then a wet one. He should wash the cloth and put it aside. </p>

<p id="p11"><span class="parno">11</span>If the newly arrived monk is more senior, the resident monk should bow down to him. He should assign a dwelling, tell him where it is, and inform him whether it’s occupied or not. He should tell him where to go for alms and where to avoid, and about any families designated as ‘in training’. He should point out the place for defecating and the place for urinating, the water for drinking and the water for washing, and the walking sticks. He should tell him about the Saṅgha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave. </p>

<p id="p12"><span class="parno">12</span>If the newly arrived monk is more junior, the resident monk should remain seated while telling him where to put his bowl and robe, and which seat to sit on. He should point out the water for drinking and the water for washing, as well as a sandal-wiping cloth. </p>

<p>If the newly arrived monk is more junior, he should bow down to the resident monk. The resident monk should tell him where his dwelling is and whether it’s occupied or not.

He should point out the place for defecating and the place for urinating, the water for drinking and the water for washing, and the walking sticks. He should tell him about the Saṅgha’s agreements concerning the right time to enter and the right time to leave. </p>

<p>This is the proper conduct for resident monks.” </p>

<h4>3. Discussion of the proper conduct for departing monks </h4>

<p id="p13"><span class="parno">13</span>At that time there were monks who departed without putting the wooden and ceramic goods in order, while leaving the door and the windows open, and without informing anyone. Wooden and ceramic goods were lost and the dwelling was unprotected. </p>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the departing monks act like this?” 
They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the departing monks are acting like this?” “It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p14"><span class="parno">14</span>“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for departing monks. </p>

<p>Before he departs, a monk should put the wooden and ceramic goods in order, close the door and the windows, and inform someone. If there are no monks, he should inform a novice monk; if there are no novice monks, he should inform a monastery worker; if there are no monastery workers, he should inform of a lay follower. If there are no monks, novice monks, monastery workers, or lay followers, he should place the bed on four rocks. He should stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should close the door and the windows, and then depart. </p>

<p>If rain enters the dwelling, he should cover it if he is able, or he should make an effort to have it covered. If this works out, all is well. If not, he should place the bed on four rocks in an area that isn’t getting wet. He should then stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should close the door and the windows, and then depart. If the whole dwelling is getting wet, he should carry the furniture to the village if he is able, or he should make an effort to have it carried to the village. If this works out, all is well. If not, he should place the bed on four rocks outside. He should then stack the beds or benches on top of one another, with the furniture in a pile on top, and he should put away the wooden and ceramic goods. He should cover it all with grass and leaves and then depart, thinking, ‘Hopefully the requisites will be okay.’ </p>

<p>This is the proper conduct for departing monks.” </p>

<h4>4. Discussion of the proper conduct in connection with the expression of appreciation </h4>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>At that time there were monks who did not express their appreciation in the dining hall. People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics not express their appreciation in the dining hall?” The monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. The Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“You should express your appreciation in the dining hall.” </p>

<p>The monks thought: “Who should give the expression of appreciation?” They told the Buddha. He gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“The most senior monk should give the expression of appreciation in the dining hall.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p16"><span class="parno">16</span>Soon afterwards a certain association was offering a meal to the Saṅgha. Venerable Sāriputta was the most senior monk. Because the Buddha had said the most senior monk should give the expression of appreciation, the monks left, leaving Sāriputta behind by himself. After giving the expression of appreciation, he left by himself. The Buddha saw him coming and asked: “Did the meal go well?” </p>

<p>“The meal went well, Venerable Sir, but the monks all left leaving me behind by myself.” Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“The four or five most senior monks should wait in the dining hall.” </p>

<p id="p17"><span class="parno">17</span>On one occasion a senior monk who needed to defecate was waiting in the dining hall. Being unable to hold out, he fainted and fell over. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“When there is something to be done, I allow you to go after informing the monk sitting next to you.” </p>

<h4>5. Discussion of the proper conduct in relation to the dining hall </h4>

<p id="p18"><span class="parno">18</span>At that time the monks from the group of six went to the dining hall shabbily dressed and improper in appearance; going the wrong way, they went ahead of the senior monks; they sat down encroaching on the senior monks; they blocked the junior monks from seats; and they spread out their upper robes and sat on them in inhabited areas. </p>

<p>The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six act like this?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six are acting like this?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct in relation to the dining hall. </p>

<p>In a monastery where the time for departure is announced, a monk should put on his sarong evenly all around, covering the navel and the knees. He should put on a belt. Putting the upper robes together, overlapping each other edge-to-edge, he should put them on and fasten the toggle. He should wash his bowl, bring it along, and enter the village carefully and without hurry. </p>

<p id="p20"><span class="parno">20</span>He should not go the wrong way and walk in front of the senior monks. He should walk well-covered in inhabited areas; he should walk well-restrained in inhabited areas; he should walk with lowered eyes in inhabited areas; he should lift up his robe while walking in inhabited areas; he should not laugh loudly while walking in inhabited areas; he should not be noisy while walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his body while walking in inhabited areas; he should not swing his arms while walking in inhabited areas; he should not sway his head while walking in inhabited areas; he should not walk in an inhabited area with his hands on his hips; he should not cover his head while walking in inhabited areas; he should not squat on his heels while walking in inhabited areas. </p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>He should sit well-covered in inhabited areas; he should sit well-restrained in inhabited areas; he should sit with lowered eyes in inhabited areas; he should not lift his robes while sitting in inhabited areas;  he should not laugh loudly while sitting in inhabited areas;  he should not be noisy while sitting in inhabited areas; he should not sway his body while sitting in inhabited areas; he should not swing his arms while sitting in inhabited areas; he should not sway his head while sitting in inhabited areas; he should not sit in an inhabited area with his hands on his hips; he should not cover his head while sitting in inhabited areas; he should not clasp his knees while sitting in inhabited areas. He should not sit encroaching on the senior monks or blocking the junior monks from seats. He should not spread out his upper robe and sit on it in inhabited areas. </p>

<p id="p22"><span class="parno">22</span>When given water, he should receive it by holding his bowl with both hands. Holding the bowl low, he should rinse it carefully without scratching it. If there is someone to receive the water, he should hold his bowl low and pour the water into the container, trying to avoid splashing the person receiving the water, the monks sitting nearby, or his upper robe. If there is no one to receive the water, he should hold his bowl low and pour the water on the ground, trying to avoid splashing the monks sitting nearby or his upper robe. </p>

<p id="p23"><span class="parno">23</span>When given rice, he should receive it by holding his bowl with both hands, leaving room for the curry.

<p>On one occasion a certain monk entered a house without being attentive. Thinking it was the main door, he entered a room where a woman was sleeping naked. The monk saw her 

and left the room. Seeing her lying there, 

the woman’s husband thought: “My wife has been raped by this monk,” and he took hold of that monk and gave him a beating. The woman woke up from the noise and asked her husband: “Why are you beating this monk?” </p>

<p>“Didn’t he rape you?” </p>

<h4>14. Discussion of the proper conduct toward a pupil </h4>

<p id="p101"><span class="parno">101</span>At that time the teachers were not conducting themselves properly toward their pupils. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the teachers not conduct themselves properly toward their pupils?” They told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he had the Saṅgha gathered and questioned the monks: “Is it true, monks, that the teachers are not conducting themselves properly toward their pupils?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” … After rebuking them … the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p id="p102"><span class="parno">102</span>“Well then, I will lay down the proper conduct for a teacher toward his pupil. A teacher should conduct himself properly toward his pupil. This is the proper conduct: </p>

<p id="p103"><span class="parno">103</span>A teacher should help and take care of his pupil through recitation, questioning, and instruction. If the teacher has a bowl, but not the pupil, the teacher should give it to him, or he should make an effort to get him one. If the teacher has a robe, but not the pupil, the teacher should give it to him, or he should make an effort to get him one. If the teacher has a requisite, but not the pupil, the teacher should give it to him, or he should make an effort to get him one. </p>

<p id="p104"><span class="parno">104</span>If the pupil is sick, the teacher should get up at the appropriate time and give his pupil a tooth cleaner and water for rinsing the mouth, and he should prepare a seat for him. If there is rice porridge, he should wash a vessel and bring the rice porridge to his pupil. When the pupil has drunk the rice porridge, the teacher should give him water and receive the vessel. Holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it and then put it away. When the pupil has gotten up, the teacher should put away the seat. If the place is dirty, he should sweep it. </p>

<p id="p105"><span class="parno">105</span>If the pupil wants to enter the village, the teacher should give him a sarong and receive the one he’s wearing in return. He should give him a belt.

If the robe is moist, he should sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat. He should fold the robe, offsetting the edges by seven centimeters, so that the fold doesn’t become worn. He should place the belt in the fold. </p>

<hr>

<p id="p107"><span class="parno">107</span>If there is almsfood and his pupil wants to eat, the teacher should give him water and then the almsfood. </p>

Holding it low, he should wash it carefully without scratching it. He should then dry it and sun it for a short while, but he shouldn’t leave it in the heat. The teacher should put away the robe and bowl. When putting away the bowl, he should hold the bowl in one hand, feel under the bed or the bench with the other, and then put it away.
