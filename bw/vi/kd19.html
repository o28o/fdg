<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Awakened One, the Lord was staying at Sāvatthī in the Eastern Monastery in the long house of Migāra’s mother. Now at that time the Lord was sitting down surrounded by an Order of monks on an Observance day. Then, when the night was far spent, as the first watch was waning, the venerable Ānanda, rising from his seat, having arranged his upper robe over one shoulder, having saluted the Lord with joined palms, spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

<p>"Lord, the night is far spent, the first watch is waning; the Order of monks has been sitting down for a long time; Lord, let the Lord recite the Pāṭimokkha to the monks." When he had spoken thus the Lord became silent.</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>And when the night was far spent, as the middle watch was waning, the venerable Ānanda a second time rising from his seat, having arranged … spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

<p>"Lord, the night is far spent, the middle watch is waning; … recite the Pāṭimokkha to the monks." And a second time the Lord became silent.</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>And when the night was far spent, as the last watch was waning, when the sun had risen and the night had a face of gladness, a third time did the venerable Ānanda, rising from his seat, having arranged … speak thus to the Lord:</p>

<p>"Lord, the night is far spent, the last watch is waning; the sun has risen, the night has a face of gladness; the Order of monks has been sitting down for a long time; Lord, let the Lord recite the Pāṭimokkha to the monks."</p>

<p>"Ānanda, the assembly is not entirely pure."</p>

<hr>
<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Then it occurred to the venerable Moggallāna the Great:</p>

<p>"Now, on account of which individual did the Lord speak thus: ‘Ānanda, the assembly is not entirely pure’?" Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great with his mind compassed the minds of the entire Order of monks. Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great saw that individual sitting in the midst of the Order of monks—of bad moral habit, depraved in character, of impure and suspicious behaviour, of concealed actions, not a (true) recluse (although) pretending to be a (true) recluse, not a farer of the Brahma-faring (although) pretending to be a farer of the Brahma-faring, rotten within, filled with desire, filthy by nature; seeing him, he approached that individual, having approached, he spoke thus to that individual:</p>

<p>"Get up, your reverence, the Lord has seen you; for you there is no communion together with the monks." When he had spoken thus that individual became silent. And a second time … And a third time the venerable Moggallāna the Great spoke thus to that individual: "Get up, your reverence … for you there is no communion together with the monks." And a third time that individual became silent. Then the venerable Moggallāna the Great, having taken that individual by the arm, having thrust him out through the porch of the gateway, having shot the bolt, approached the Lord; having approached, he spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

<p>"Lord I have thrust that individual out; the company is entirely pure; Lord, let the Lord recite the Pāṭimokkha to the monks."</p>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>"How strange, Moggallāna, how wonderful, Moggallāna, that that foolish man should have waited even until he was taken hold of by the arm."</p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Monks, there are these eight strange and wonderful things about the great ocean, from constantly having seen which <i>asuras</i> delight in the great ocean. What are the eight?</p>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>The great ocean, monks, deepens gradually, slopes gradually, shelves gradually, with no abruptness like a precipice. And monks, that the great ocean deepens gradually, slopes gradually, shelves gradually with no abruptness like a precipice—this, monks, is the first strange and wonderful thing about the great ocean from constantly having seen which <i>asuras</i> delight in the great ocean.</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p15"><span class="parno">15</span>"In exactly the same way, monks, in this dhamma and discipline there are eight strange and wonderful things from constantly having seen which monks delight in this dhamma and discipline. What are the eight?</p>

And, monks, that in this dhamma and discipline there is a … gradual course with no abruptness such as penetration of profound knowledge, this, monks, is the first strange and wonderful thing from constantly having seen which monks delight in this dhamma and discipline.</p>

<p id="p19"><span class="parno">19</span>"And even, monks, as those great rivers, that is to say the Ganges, the Jumna, the Aciravatī, the Sarabhū, the Mahī which, on reaching the great ocean, lose their former names and identities and are reckoned simply as the great ocean, even so, monks, (members of) these four castes: noble, brahman, merchant and low, having gone forth from home into homelessness in this dhamma and discipline proclaimed by the Truth-finder, lose their former names and clans and are reckoned simply as recluses, sons of the Sakyans … this, monks, is the fourth strange and wonderful thing …</p>

<p id="p24"><span class="parno">24</span>Then the Lord, having known this matter, at that time uttered this utterance:</p>

<p id="p25" class="verse"><span class="parno">25</span>"It rains hard on a covered thing,
<br>It rains not hard on an open thing;
<br>So open up the covered thing,
<br>Thus will it not rain hard on that."</p>

<h4>&nbsp;</h4>

<p id="p26"><span class="parno">26</span>Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: "Now, I, monks, henceforth will not carry out the Observance, I will not recite the Pāṭimokkha; now you yourselves, monks, must henceforth carry out the Observance, must recite the Pāṭimokkha. It is not possible, monks, it cannot come to pass that the Truth-finder should carry out the Observance, should recite the Pāṭimokkha with an assembly that is not entirely pure. Nor, monks, should the Pāṭimokkha be heard by one who has an offence. Whoever (such) should hear it, there is an offence of wrong-doing. I allow you, monks, to suspend the Pāṭimokkha for him who, having an offence, hears the Pāṭimokkha. And thus, monks, should it be suspended: On an Observance day, whether it be the fourteenth or the fifteenth, when that individual is present this should be uttered in the midst of the Order:</p>

<p id="p27"><span class="parno">27</span>‘<span class="kamma">Honoured sirs, let the Order listen to me. The individual So-and-so has an offence; I am suspending the Pāṭimokkha for him, the Pāṭimokkha should not be recited when he is present</span>’—(thus) does the Pāṭimokkha become suspended."</p>

<p id="p28"><span class="parno">28</span>Now at that time the group of six monks, thinking: "No one knows about us," listened to the Pāṭimokkha although they had offences. Monks who were elders, knowing the minds of others, told the monks: "So-and-so and So-and-so, your reverences, (belonging to) the group of six monks, thinking, ‘No one knows about us,’ listened to the Pāṭimokkha although they had offences." The group of six monks heard it said that the monks who were elders, knowing the minds of others, had told the monks: "So-and-so and So-and-so … listened to the Pāṭimokkha although they had offences."</p>

<p id="p29"><span class="parno">29</span>These, thinking: "In case the well behaved monks suspend the Pāṭimokkha for us," suspended first, without ground, without reason, the Pāṭimokkha for the pure monks who had no offences. These who were modest monks … spread it about, saying: "How can this group of six monks suspend, without ground, without reason, the Pāṭimokkha for pure monks who have no offences?" Then these monks told this matter to the Lord. He said: "Is it true, as is said, monks, that the group of six monks suspended, without ground, without reason, the Pāṭimokkha for pure monks who have no offences?"</p>

<p>"It is true, Lord." Having rebuked them, having given reasoned talk, he addressed the monks, saying:</p>

<p>"<span class="rule">Monks, you should not, without ground, without reason, suspend the Pāṭimokkha for pure monks who have no offences. Whoever should (so) suspend it, there is an offence of wrong-doing.</span></p>

<p id="p69"><span class="parno">69</span>Then the venerable Upāli approached the Lord; having approached, having greeted the Lord, he sat down at a respectful distance. As he was sitting down at a respectful distance, the venerable Upāli spoke thus to the Lord:</p>

<p id="p71"><span class="parno">71</span>If, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘It is a wrong time to undertake this undertaking on my own behalf, not a right time,’ Upāli, that undertaking on his own behalf should not be undertaken.

<hr>
<p id="p73"><span class="parno">73</span>But if, Upāli, while that monk is considering he knows thus: ‘That undertaking on my own behalf is about a true thing, not an untrue thing,’ Upāli, it should be further considered by that monk: ‘That undertaking which I wish to undertake on my own behalf, is that undertaking connected with the goal, or not?’ If, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘This undertaking on my own behalf is unconnected with the goal, not connected with it,’ Upāli, that undertaking on his own behalf should not be undertaken.</p>

<p id="p74"><span class="parno">74</span>But if, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘This undertaking on my own behalf is connected with the goal, not unconnected with it.’ Upāli, it should be further considered by that monk: ‘Will I, undertaking this undertaking on my own behalf, attract monks who are comrades and associates to my side in accordance with dhamma, in accordance with discipline, or not?’ If, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘I, undertaking this undertaking on my own behalf, will not attract monks who are comrades and associates to my side in accordance with dhamma, in accordance with discipline,’ Upāli, that undertaking on his own behalf should not be undertaken. But, if, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘I, undertaking this undertaking on my own behalf, will attract monks who are comrades and associates to my side in accordance with dhamma, in accordance with discipline,’ Upāli, it should be further considered by that monk: ‘From my having undertaken this undertaking on my own behalf, will there be for the Order from that source strife, quarrel, dispute, contention, schism in the Order, dissension in the Order, altercation in the Order, differences in the Order, or not?’ If, Upāli, while this monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘From my having undertaken this undertaking on my own behalf, there will be for the Order from that source strife … differences in the Order,’ Upāli, that undertaking should not be undertaken on his own behalf.</p>

<p id="p75"><span class="parno">75</span>But if, Upāli, while that monk is considering, he knows thus: ‘From my having undertaken this undertaking on my own behalf, there will not be for the Order from that source strife … differences in the Order,’ Upāli, that undertaking on his own behalf may be undertaken. Thus, Upāli, if an undertaking on one’s own behalf is undertaken when it is endowed with these five qualities, later it will be no cause for remorse."</p>
