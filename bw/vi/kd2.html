<p id="1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha on the Vulture Peak. At that time, on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of the lunar half-month, the wanderers of other religions gathered and gave teachings. People came to listen to those teachings, and they acquired affection for and confidence in those wanderers. And the wanderers gained a following. </p>

<p>Then, when King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was reflecting in private, he considered this 
and thought: “Why don’t the venerables, too, gather on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>He then went to the Buddha, bowed, sat down, and told him what he had thought, adding: “It would be good, Venerable Sir, if the venerables, too, gathered on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month.” The Buddha then instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. When the Buddha had finished, the King got up from his seat, bowed, circumambulated the Buddha with his right side toward him, and left. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You should gather together on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month.” </p>

<p id="3"><span class="parno">3</span>When the monks heard about the Buddha’s instruction, they started gathering on those days. People came to hear a teaching, but the monks sat in silence. The people complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics gather on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day of the half-month, but then sit in silence like dumb pigs? Shouldn’t they give a teaching when they gather together?” The monks heard the complaints of those people and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards the Buddha gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<p class="rule">“When you gather together on the fourteenth, the fifteenth, and the eighth day of the lunar half-month, you should give a teaching.” </p>

<h4>2. The instruction to recite the Monastic Code </h4>

<p id="4"><span class="parno">4</span>While the Buddha was reflecting in private, he thought: “Why don’t I instruct the monks to recite a monastic code, consisting of those training rules that I have laid down for them? That would be their procedure for the observance day.” </p>

<p>In the evening, when the Buddha had come out from seclusion, he gave a teaching and addressed the monks. He told them what he had thought, adding, </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You should recite the Monastic Code. </p>

<p>And you should do it like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<hr>

<p id="5"><span class="parno">5</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, it should do the observance-day ceremony, it should recite the Monastic Code. What is the preliminary duty of the Saṅgha? The venerables should declare their purity. I will recite the Monastic Code. Everyone present should listen to it and attend carefully. Anyone who has committed an offense should reveal it. If you haven’t committed any offense, you should remain silent. If you are silent, I will regard you as pure. Just as one responds when asked individually, so too, an announcement is made three times in this kind of gathering. If a monk remembers an offense while the announcement is being made up to the third time, but doesn’t reveal it, he is lying in full awareness. Lying in full awareness is called an obstacle by the Buddha. A monk who remembers an offense and is seeking purification should therefore reveal it. When it’s revealed, he will be at ease.’” </p>

<p>Definitions </p>

<dl><dt>
<span class="parno">6</span>Monastic code: </dt><dd>
this is the beginning, this is the front, this is at the head in wholesome qualities—therefore it is called “Monastic Code”. </dd><dt>
Venerables: </dt><dd>
this is a term of affection, a term of respect; it is an expression of respect and deference, that is: “Venerables”. </dd><dt>
I will recite: </dt><dd>
I will set forth, I will teach, I will declare, I will set out, I will reveal, I will analyze, I will make plain, I will manifest. </dd><dt>
It: </dt><dd>
The Monastic Code is what is meant. </dd><dt>
Everyone present: </dt><dd>
to whatever extent there are senior monks, junior monks, and monks of middle standing in that gathering—these are called “everyone present”. </dd><dt>
Should listen carefully: </dt><dd>
should be attentive, should pay attention, should apply their whole mind. </dd><dt>
Should attend: </dt><dd>
should listen with a one-pointed mind, with an undistracted mind, with a non-wandering mind. </dd><dt>
Anyone who has committed an offense: </dt><dd>
a senior monk, a junior monk, or a monk of middle standing who has committed a particular offense among the five or seven classes of offenses. </dd><dt>
Should reveal it: </dt><dd>
should confess it, should disclose it, should make it plain, should make it known—either in the midst of the Saṅgha, in the midst of a group, or to an individual. </dd><dt>
If you haven’t committed any offense: </dt><dd>
if you have not committed any offense or you have cleared yourself after committing one. </dd><dt>
You should remain silent: </dt><dd>
you should be patient; you should not say anything. </dd><dt>
I will regard you as pure: </dt><dd>
I will know; I will remember. </dd><dt>
Just as one responds when asked individually: </dt><dd>
just as one would respond when asked privately, so too, one should know of that gathering that “It’s asking me.” </dd><dt>
This kind of gathering: </dt><dd>
a gathering of monks is what is meant. </dd><dt>
When the announcement is made three times: </dt><dd>
when the announcement is made once, when the announcement is made for the second time, and also when the announcement is made for the third time. </dd><dt>
Remembers: </dt><dd>
Knows, perceives. </dd><dt>
An offense: </dt><dd>
one that has been committed, or one that has not been cleared after being committed. </dd><dt>
But doesn’t reveal it: </dt><dd>
does not confess it, disclose it, make it plain, make it known—either in the midst of the Saṅgha, in the midst of a group, or to an individual. </dd><dt>
He is lying in full awareness: </dt><dd>
what is there for lying in full awareness? There is an act of wrong conduct. </dd><dt>
Is called an obstacle by the Buddha: </dt><dd>
an obstacle for what? It is an obstacle for reaching the first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, the fourth absorption; an obstacle for reaching the wholesome qualities of absorption, release, stillness, attainment, renunciation, escape, seclusion. </dd><dt>
Therefore: </dt><dd>
for that reason. </dd><dt>
Who remembers: </dt><dd>
who knows, who perceives. </dd><dt>
Is seeking purification: </dt><dd>
Is desiring to be cleared, is desiring purity. </dd><dt>
An offense: </dt><dd>
one that has been committed, or one that has not been cleared after being committed. </dd><dt>
Should reveal it: </dt><dd>
should reveal it either in the midst of the Saṅgha, in the midst of a group, or to an individual. </dd><dt>
When it’s revealed, he will be at ease: </dt><dd>
at ease for what? He will be at ease for reaching the first absorption, the second absorption, the third absorption, the forth absorption; at ease for reaching the wholesome qualities of absorption, release, stillness, attainment, renunciation, escape, seclusion. </dd></dl>

<p id="7"><span class="parno">7</span>When they heard that the Buddha required the recitation of the Monastic Code, some monks recited it daily. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not recite the Monastic Code every day. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should recite the Monastic Code on the observance day.” </p>

<p id="8"><span class="parno">8</span>When they heard that the Buddha required the recitation of the Monastic Code on the observance day, some monks recited it three times per half-month: on the fourteenth, fifteenth, and eighth day. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not recite the Monastic Code three times per lunar half-month. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should recite the Monastic Code once every lunar half-month: on the fourteenth or the fifteenth day.” </p>

<p id="9"><span class="parno">9</span>On one occasion the monks from the group of six recited the Monastic Code separately, each to his own followers. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not recite the Monastic Code separately, each to your own followers. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should do the observance-day procedure in a complete assembly.” </p>

<p id="10"><span class="parno">10</span>When they knew that the Buddha had laid down a rule that the observance-day procedure should be done in a complete assembly, the monks thought: “How far does a complete assembly extend? As far as one monastery or as far as the entire earth?” </p>

<p class="rule">“A complete assembly extends as far as one monastery.” </p>

<h4>3. Mahākappina </h4>

<p id="11"><span class="parno">11</span>At that time Venerable Mahākappina was staying at Rājagaha in the deer park at Maddakucchi. On one occasion, while reflecting in private, he thought: “Should I go to the observance-day ceremony? Should I go to the legal procedures of the Saṅgha? Regardless, I’ve reached the highest purity.” </p>

<p>The Buddha read his mind. Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, the Buddha disappeared from the Vulture Peak and reappeared in front of Mahākappina, where he sat down on the prepared seat. Mahākappina bowed and sat down, and the Buddha said to him: </p>

<p>“Isn’t it the case, Kappina, that you were wondering whether or not you should go to the observance day and the legal procedures of the Saṅgha?” </p>

<p>“Yes, Venerable Sir.” </p>

<p>“If you brahmins don’t honor and revere the observance day, then who will? Go to the observance day, brahmin, and go to the legal procedures of the Saṅgha.” </p>

<p>“Yes.” </p>

<p>The Buddha instructed, inspired, and gladdened him with a teaching. Then, just as a strong man might bend or stretch his arm, the Buddha disappeared from Mahākappina’s presence and reappeared on the Vulture Peak. </p>

<h4>4. The allowance for monastery zones </h4>

<p id="12"><span class="parno">12</span>When they knew that the Buddha had laid down a rule that a complete assembly extends as far as one monastery, the monks thought: “How far does a single monastery extend?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow you to establish a monastery zone. </p>

<p>And it should be established like this. First you should announce the zone markers: a hill, a rock, a forest grove, a tree, a path, an anthill, a river, a lake. Then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p id="13"><span class="parno">13</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should establish a monastery zone based on the announced markers, defining who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day ceremony together. This is the motion. </p>

<hr>

<p id="14"><span class="parno">14</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha establishes a monastery zone based on the announced markers, defining who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day ceremony together. Any monk who approves of establishing a monastery zone based on these markers, defining who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day ceremony together, should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p>The Saṅgha has established a monastery zone based on these markers, defining who belongs to the same community and who should do the observance-day ceremony together. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” </p>

<hr>

<p id="15"><span class="parno">15</span>When they heard that the Buddha had made an allowance to establish a monastery zone, the monks from the group of six established zones that were too large: 50, 65, and even 80 kilometers across. Monks coming to the observance-day ceremony arrived while the Monastic Code was being recited or just after, and they had to stop overnight while on the way. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not establish a monastery zone that is too large, whether 50, 65, or 80 kilometers across. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should establish a monastery zone that is 40 kilometers across at the most.” </p>

<p id="16"><span class="parno">16</span>At one time the monks from the group of six had established a zone that crossed a river. Monks on their way to the observance-day ceremony were swept away by the current, as were their bowls and robes. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not establish a monastery zone that crosses a river. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to establish a monastery zone that crosses a river only if there is a permanent bridge or ferry connection.” </p>

<h4>5. Discussion of the observance-day hall </h4>

<p id="17"><span class="parno">17</span>At that time the monks recited the Monastic Code in one yard after another without making a prior appointment. Newly arrived monks did not know where the observance-day ceremony was to be held. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not recite the Monastic Code in one yard after another without making a prior appointment. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. I allow you to designate an observance-day hall—whether a dwelling, a stilt house, or a cave—for the observance-day ceremony. </p>

<p>And it should be designated like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p id="18"><span class="parno">18</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should designate such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall. This is the motion. </p>

<p id="19"><span class="parno">19</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha designates such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall. Any monk who approves of designating such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p>The Saṅgha has designated such-and-such a dwelling as the observance-day hall. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” </p>

<p id="20"><span class="parno">20</span>Soon afterwards in a certain monastery, they designated two different observance-day halls. Monks gathered in both places, each group thinking: “The observance-day ceremony will be done here.” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not designate two different observance-day halls within the same monastery. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. You should abolish one of them and do the observance-day ceremony in one place. </p>

<p>And it should be abolished like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p id="21"><span class="parno">21</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should abolish such-and-such an observance-day hall. This is the motion. </p>

<p id="22"><span class="parno">22</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha abolishes such-and-such an observance-day hall. Any monk who approves of abolishing such-and-such an observance-day hall should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p>The Saṅgha has abolished such-and-such an observance-day hall. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” </p>

<h4>6. The allowance for an observance-day forecourt </h4>

<p id="23"><span class="parno">23</span>At one time in a certain monastery, they had designated an observance-day hall that was too small. On the observance day a large saṅgha of monks gathered there. Some monks listened to the recitation of the Monastic Code while sitting outside the designated area. Knowing that the Buddha had laid down a rule that the observance-day ceremony should be done after designating an observance-day hall, they wondered: “Have we done the observance-day ceremony or not?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“Whether you listen to the recitation of the Monastic Code while seated within or outside the designated area, in either case you have done the observance-day ceremony. </p>

<p class="rule">Still, the Saṅgha may designate an observance-day forecourt as large as it likes. </p>

<p>And it should be designated like this. First the markers should be announced. Then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p id="24"><span class="parno">24</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, the Saṅgha should designate an observance-day forecourt based on the announced markers. This is the motion. </p>

<p id="25"><span class="parno">25</span>Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. The Saṅgha designates an observance-day forecourt based on the announced markers. Any monk who approves of designating an observance-day forecourt based on these markers should remain silent. Any monk who doesn’t approve should speak up. </p>

<p>The Saṅgha has designated an observance-day forecourt based on these markers. The Saṅgha approves and is therefore silent. I will remember it thus.’” </p>

If you have committed this offense, you should make amends for it.” The other monk said: “It’s not just I alone who have committed this offense, but this whole saṅgha.” The learned monk said: “What does it matter to you whether others have or haven’t committed an offense? Please clear yourself of your own offense.” </p>

<p>Then, because of what the learned monk had said, the other monk made amends for that offense. He then went to the other monks and said: “When someone does such-and-such, he’s committed an offense of this name. This is the offense that you’ve committed. You should make amends for it.” But in spite of what he had said, those monks did not want to make amends for that offense. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“In a case such as this, 


if those monks do make amends for that offense because of what that monk has said, then this is good. If they don’t, then that monk doesn’t need not correct them if he doesn’t want to.” </p>
