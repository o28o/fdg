<p id="p1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Rājagaha in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrel sanctuary. At that time the Buddha had not yet laid down the rainy-season residence for the monks. And so the monks were wandering about in the winter, in the summer, and also during the rainy season. </p>

<p>People complained and criticized them: “How can the Sakyan monastics go wandering in the winter, in the summer, and even during the rainy season? They’re trampling down the green grass, oppressing one-sensed life, and destroying many small creatures. Even the monastics of other religions, with their flawed teachings, settle down for the rainy-season. Even birds make a nest in the top of a tree and settle down for the rainy-season. But not so the Sakyan monastics.”</p>

<p id="p2"><span class="parno">2</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people and told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>

<p class='rule'> “You should enter the rainy-season residence.”</p>

<hr>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<p>The monks thought: “When should we enter the rains residence?” They told the Buddha.</p>

<p class='rule'>“You should enter the rainy-season residence during the rainy season.”</p>

<p id="p3"><span class="parno">3</span>The monks thought: “How many entries to the rains residence are there?” </p>

<p class='rule'>“There are two entries to the rainy-season residence: the first and the second. The first should be entered on the day after the full moon of July and the second one month after the same full moon.” </p>

<h4>2. The prohibition against wandering during the rainy season, etc.</h4>

<p id="p4"><span class="parno">4</span>Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six entered the rains residence and then went wandering during the rainy season. People complained and criticized them just as they had before.</p>

<hr>

<p id="p5"><span class="parno">5</span>The monks heard the complaints of those people and the monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How could the monks from the group of six enter the rains residence and then go wandering during the rainy season?” And they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>


<p class='rule'>“After entering the rainy-season residence, you should stay put for the first or the second three-month period before you go wandering. If you go wandering during the rainy-season residence period, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>The monks from the group of six did not want to enter the rains residence. </p>

<p class='rule'>“You should enter the rainy-season residence. If you don’t, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p7"><span class="parno">7</span>On the day of the entry to the rains residence, the monks from the group of six deliberately bypassed a monastery because they did not want to enter the rains residence. </p>

<p class='rule'>“On the day of the entry to the rainy-season residence, you shouldn’t deliberately bypass a monastery because you don’t want to enter the rainy-season residence. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.”</p>

<p id="p8"><span class="parno">8</span>At one time King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha wanted to postpone the rains residence. He sent a message to the monks: “Would the venerables please enter the rains residence at the next full moon?” They told the Buddha.</p>

<p class='rule'>“You should comply with the wishes of kings.”</p>

<h5>3. The allowance for seven-day business </h5>

<p id="p9"><span class="parno">9</span>When the Buddha had stayed at Rājagaha for as long as he liked, he set out wandering toward Sāvatthī. When he eventually arrived, he stayed in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery.</p>

<p>At that time the lay follower Udena had had a dwelling built for the Saṅgha in the Kosalan country. He sent a message to the monks: “Please come, Venerables, I wish to make an offering, hear the Teaching, and see the monks.”</p>

<p>The monks replied: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that a monk who’s entered the rains residence shouldn’t go wandering until after the rains. Please wait, Udena. Once we’ve completed the rains residence, we’ll come. But if the matter is urgent, then give the dwelling in the presence of the local monks.”</p>

<p>Udena complained and criticized them: “How can the venerables not come when I’ve sent them a message? I’m a donor and I provide services. I’m a supporter of the Saṅgha!”</p>

<hr>

<p id="p10"><span class="parno">10</span>The monks heard his complaints and they told the Buddha. Soon afterwards he gave a teaching and addressed the monks:</p>

<p class='rule'>“If any of seven kinds of persons—a monk, a nun, a trainee nun, a novice monk, a novice nun, a male lay follower, or a female lay follower—asks you to come, I allow you to go for seven days, but only if you’re asked. And you should return within seven days.</p>

<p id="p21"><span class="parno">21</span>On one occasion a certain monk was sick. He sent a message to the monks: “Please come, Venerables, I’m sick.” They told the Buddha.</p>
