 <section class="raw_sutta">
 <div lang="en">
<p id="1"><span class="parno">1</span>At one time the Buddha was staying at Sāvatthī in the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. At that time in a certain monastery in the Kosalan country a number of monks who were friends had entered rainy-season residence together. They thought: “How can we have a comfortable rains, live in peace and harmony, and get almsfood without trouble?” </p>

<p>Then it occurred to them: “Let’s not talk to one another. Whoever returns first from alms round in the village should prepare the seats, and set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. He should wash the bowl for leftovers and put it out, and set out water for drinking and water for washing. </p>

<p>Whoever returns last from alms round may eat whatever is leftover, or he should discard it where there are no cultivated plants or in water without life. He should put away the seats and also the foot stool, the foot scraper, and the water for washing the feet. He should wash the bowl for leftovers and put it away, put away the water for drinking and the water for washing, and sweep the dining hall. </p>

<p>Whoever sees that the pot for drinking water, the pot for washing water, or the water pot in the restroom is empty should fill it. If he can’t do it by himself, he should call someone over by hand signal, and they should fill it together. He should not speak because of that. In this way we’ll have a comfortable rains, live in peace and harmony, and get almsfood without trouble.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="2"><span class="parno">2</span>And they did just that. 
</p>

<hr>

<p id="3"><span class="parno">3</span>Now it was the custom for monks who had completed the rainy-season residence to go and see the Buddha. And so, when the three months were over and they had completed the rains residence, they put their dwellings in order, took their bowls and robes, and set out for Sāvatthī. When they eventually arrived, they went to the Jeta Grove, Anāthapiṇḍika’s Monastery. There they approached the Buddha, bowed, and sat down. </p>

<p>Since it is the custom for Buddhas to greet newly arrived monks, the Buddha said to them: “I hope you’re keeping well, monks, I hope you’re getting by.  I hope you had a comfortable and harmonious rains, and got almsfood without trouble.” </p>

<p>“We’re keeping well, Venerable Sir, we’re getting by. We had a comfortable and harmonious rains, and got almsfood without trouble.” </p>

<hr>

<p>When Buddhas know what is going on, sometimes they ask and sometimes not. They know the right time to ask and when not to ask. Buddhas ask when it is beneficial, otherwise not, for Buddhas are incapable of doing what is unbeneficial. Buddhas question the monks for two reasons: to give a teaching or to lay down a training rule. </p>

<p>So the Buddha said to those monks: “In what way, monks, did you have a harmonious and comfortable rains? And how did you get almsfood without trouble?” </p>

<hr>

<p id="4"><span class="parno">4</span>When they had told him, the Buddha addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p id="5"><span class="parno">5</span>“While being uncomfortable, these foolish men claim they were living in comfort. While living together like animals, they claim they were living in comfort. While living together like sheep, they claim they were living in comfort. While living together like enemies, they claim they were living in comfort. </p>

<p>How could these foolish men take a vow of silence, like the monastics of other religions? This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them and giving a teaching, he addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You should not take a vow of silence, like the monastics of other religions. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p class="rule">When you have completed the rainy-season residence, you should invite the monks to correct you in regard to three things: what has been seen, heard, and suspected. </p>

<hr>

<p>This will help you live with one another in the proper way, help you clear yourself of offenses, and help you prioritize the training. </p>

<p>And you should do the invitation ceremony like this. A competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<p id="p6"><span class="parno">6</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Today is the invitation ceremony. If it seems appropriate to the Saṅgha, it should do the invitation ceremony.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="7"><span class="parno">7</span>The most senior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: </p>

<p>‘I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the second time, I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the third time, I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.’ </p>

<hr>

<p id="8"><span class="parno">8</span>Each junior monk should put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say: </p>

<p>‘I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the second time I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends. For the third time I invite the Saṅgha to correct me concerning what you have seen, heard, or suspect. Please correct me, Venerables, out of compassion. If I see a fault, I will make amends.’” </p>



<hr>


<p id="9"><span class="parno">9</span>Soon afterwards the monks from the group of six remained seated while the senior monks were inviting correction, squatting on their heels. The monks of few desires complained and criticized them: “How can the monks from the group of six act like this?” They told the Buddha. … </p>

<p>“Is it true, monks, that the monks from the group of six were acting like this?” </p>

<p>“It’s true, Sir.” The Buddha rebuked them … </p>

<p>“How can those foolish men act like this?” This will affect people’s confidence …” After rebuking them … he gave a teaching and addressed the monks: </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“You should not remain seated while the senior monks are inviting correction, squatting on their heels. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p class="rule">Everyone should squat on their heels during the invitation ceremony.” </p>

<hr>

<p id="10"><span class="parno">10</span>On one occasion, while squatting on his heels and waiting for everyone to finish, a senior monk who was weak from old age fainted and fell over. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should squat on your heels until you have invited correction. Once you have invited, you may sit down.” </p>

<h4>2. Breach of the invitation ceremony </h4>

<p id="11"><span class="parno">11</span>The monks thought: “How many invitation days are there?” </p>

<p class="rule">“There are two invitation days: the fourteenth and the fifteenth day of the lunar half-month.” </p>

<p id="12"><span class="parno">12</span>The monks thought: “How many kinds of invitation procedure are there?” </p>

<hr>

<p>“There are four kinds: </p><ul><li>
The invitation procedure that is illegitimate and has an incomplete assembly. </li><li>
The invitation procedure that is illegitimate but has a complete assembly. </li><li>
The invitation procedure that is legitimate but has an incomplete assembly. </li><li>
The invitation procedure that is legitimate and has a complete assembly. </li></ul><p class="rule">
The first, second, and third of these should not be done; I haven’t allowed such procedures. The fourth should be done; I have allowed such a procedure. Therefore, monks, you should train like this: ‘We will do invitation procedures that are legitimate and have a complete assembly.’” </p>

<h4>3. The allowance to pass on the invitation </h4>

<p id="13"><span class="parno">13</span>The Buddha addressed the monks: “Gather, monks, for the Saṅgha to do the invitation ceremony.” A monk said to the Buddha: “There’s a sick monk, Venerable Sir. He hasn’t come.” </p>

<p class="rule">“I allow a sick monk to pass on his invitation. </p>

<hr>

<p>And he should pass it on like this. The sick monk should approach a monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, and squat on his heels. He should then raise his joined palms and say, ‘I pass on my invitation; please convey my invitation; please announce my invitation; please invite correction on my behalf.’ If he makes this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the invitation has been passed on. If he doesn’t make this understood by body, by speech, or by body and speech, then the invitation hasn’t been passed on. </p>

<p>If he’s able to do this, it’s good. If not, then the sick monk should be brought into the midst of the Saṅgha together with his bed or bench. They can then do the invitation ceremony. But if the one who is nursing him says, ‘If we move him, his illness will get worse, or he’ll die,’ then the sick monk shouldn’t be moved. The Saṅgha should go to where the sick monk is and do the invitation ceremony there. </p>

<p class="rule">You should not do the invitation ceremony with an incomplete Saṅgha. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<hr>

<p id="14"><span class="parno">14</span>“If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation goes away right then and there, then the invitation should be passed on to someone else. If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes right then and there, dies right then and there, admits right then and there that he’s a novice monk, admits right then and there that he’s renounced the training, admits right then and there that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, admits right then and there that he’s insane, admits right then and there that he’s deranged, admits right then and there that he’s overwhelmed by pain, admits right then and there that he’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense, admits right then and there that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense, admits right then and there that he’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view, admits right then and there that he’s a <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṇḍaka</i>, admits right then and there that he’s living in the community by theft, admits right then and there that he’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, admits right then and there that he’s an animal, admits right then and there that he’s a matricide, admits right then and there that he’s a patricide, admits right then and there that he’s a murderer of a perfected one, admits right then and there that he’s raped a nun, admits right then and there that he’s caused a schism in the Saṅgha, admits right then and there that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, or admits right then and there that he’s a hermaphrodite, then the invitation should be passed on to someone else. </p>

<p id="15"><span class="parno">15</span>If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation goes away while on his way to the invitation ceremony, then the invitation hasn’t been brought. If, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes, dies, admits that he’s a novice monk, admits that he’s renounced the training, admits that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, admits that he’s insane, admits that he’s deranged, admits that he’s overwhelmed by pain, admits that he’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense, admits that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense, admits that he’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view, admits that he’s a <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṇḍaka</i>, admits that he’s living in the community by theft, admits that he’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, admits that he’s an animal, admits that he’s a matricide, admits that he’s a patricide, admits that he’s a murderer of a perfected one, admits that he’s raped a nun, admits that he’s caused a schism in the Saṅgha, admits that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, or admits that he’s a hermaphrodite while on his way to the invitation ceremony, then the invitation hasn’t been brought. </p>


<hr>

<p id="16"><span class="parno">16</span>But if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation goes away after reaching the Saṅgha, then the invitation has been brought. </p>

<p>And if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation disrobes, dies, admits that he’s a novice monk, admits that he’s renounced the training, admits that he’s committed the worst kind of offense, admits that he’s insane, admits that he’s deranged, admits that he’s overwhelmed by pain, admits that he’s been ejected for not recognizing an offense, admits that he’s been ejected for not making amends for an offense, admits that he’s been ejected for not giving up a bad view, admits that he’s a <i lang="pi" translate="no">paṇḍaka</i>, admits that he’s living in the community by theft, admits that he’s previously left to join the monastics of another religion, admits that he’s an animal, admits that he’s a matricide, admits that he’s a patricide, admits that he’s a murderer of a perfected one, admits that he’s raped a nun, admits that he’s caused a schism in the Saṅgha, admits that he’s caused the Buddha to bleed, or admits that he’s a hermaphrodite after reaching the Saṅgha, then the invitation has been brought. </p>

<hr>

<p id="17"><span class="parno">17</span>And if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Saṅgha, but doesn’t announce the invitation because he falls asleep, then the invitation has been brought. There’s no offense for the one who is conveying the invitation. And if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Saṅgha, but doesn’t announce the invitation because he is heedless or because he gains a meditation attainment, then the invitation has been brought. There’s no offense for the one who is conveying the invitation. </p>

<p id="18"><span class="parno">18</span>And if, after the invitation has been passed on to him, the monk who is conveying the invitation reaches the Saṅgha, but deliberately doesn’t announce the invitation, then the invitation has been brought. </p>

<p class="rule">On the invitation day, if the Saṅgha has business to be done, then anyone passing on their invitation should also give their consent.” </p>

<h4>4. Discussion on being seized by relatives, etc. </h4>

<p id="19"><span class="parno">19</span>At one time on the invitation day a certain monk was seized by his relatives. They told the Buddha. </p>

<p>“If a monk is seized by his relatives on the invitation day, other monks should say to those relatives, ‘Please release this monk for a short time so that he can take part in the invitation ceremony.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good. If not, they should say to those relatives, ‘Please step aside for a moment while this monk passes on his invitation.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good. If not, they should say to those relatives, ‘Please take this monk outside the monastery zone for a short time while the Saṅgha does the invitation ceremony.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good. </p>

<p class="rule">If not, you should not do the invitation ceremony with an incomplete Saṅgha. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. </p>

<p id="20"><span class="parno">20</span>If on the invitation day a monk is seized by kings, by bandits, by scoundrels, or by enemies of the monks, other monks should say to those enemies, ‘Please release this monk for a short time, so that he can take part in the invitation ceremony.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good. If not, they should say to those enemies, ‘Please step aside for a moment while this monk passes on his invitation.’ If they’re able to do this, it’s good.

<p class="rule">If not, you should not do the invitation ceremony with an incomplete Saṅgha. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.” </p>

<h4>5. Various kinds of invitation ceremonies for the Saṅgha, etc. </h4>

<p id="21"><span class="parno">21</span>At one time on the invitation day, there were five monks staying in a certain monastery. They thought: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that the invitation ceremony should be done with a saṅgha. Now there’s five of us. So how should we do the invitation ceremony?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<hr>

<p class="rule">“When there are five of you, you should do the invitation ceremony in the Saṅgha.” </p>

<p id="22"><span class="parno">22</span>At one time on the invitation day, there were four monks staying in a certain monastery.

<p>At one time on the invitation day, a monk was staying in a certain monastery by himself. He thought: “The Buddha has instructed that the invitation ceremony should be done in the Saṅgha when there are five monks and with one another when there are two, three, or four. But I’m here by myself. So how should I do the invitation ceremony?” </p>

<p id="33"><span class="parno">33</span>“On the invitation day, a monk may be staying by himself in a certain monastery. He should sweep the place where the monks normally go: whether the assembly hall, under a roof-cover, or at the foot of a tree. He should set out water for drinking and water for washing. He should prepare a seat, light a lamp, and sit down. </p>

<p>If other monks arrive, he should do the invitation ceremony with them. If not, he should determine: ‘Today is my invitation ceremony.’ </p>

<h4>6. The process for making amends for an offense </h4>

<p id="35"><span class="parno">35</span>At one time on the invitation day, a certain monk had committed an offense. He thought: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that one shouldn’t invite correction if one has an offense. And I’ve committed an offense. So what should I do?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">36</span>“On the invitation day, a monk may have committed an offense. He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. I confess it.’ The other should say, ‘Do you recognize the offense?’  ‘Yes, I recognize it.’  ‘You should restrain yourself in the future.’ </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">37</span>On the invitation day, a monk may be unsure if he’s committed an offense. He should approach a single monk, put his upper robe over one shoulder, squat on his heels, raise his joined palms, and say, ‘I’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. I will make amends for it when I’m sure.’ They can then do the invitation ceremony. This is not an obstacle to doing the invitation ceremony.” </p>

<h4>7. The process for revealing an offense </h4>

<p id="38"><span class="parno">38</span>At one time a certain monk remembered an offense during the invitation ceremony. He thought: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that one shouldn’t invite correction if one has an offense. And I’ve committed an offense. So what should I do?” They told the Buddha. </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">39</span>“During the invitation ceremony, a monk may remember an offense. He should say to a monk sitting next to him, ‘I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. Once this ceremony is finished, I’ll make amends for it.’ They can then continue the invitation ceremony. This is not an obstacle to doing the invitation ceremony. </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">40</span>During the invitation ceremony, a monk may become unsure if he’s committed an offense. He should say to a monk sitting next to him, ‘I’m unsure if I’ve committed such-and-such an offense. I’ll make amends for it when I’m sure.’ They can then continue the invitation ceremony. This is not an obstacle to doing the invitation ceremony. </p>

<h4>8. The process for making amends for a shared offense </h4>

<p id="41"><span class="parno">41</span>At one time on the invitation day, the whole saṅgha in a certain monastery had committed the same offense. The monks thought: “The Buddha has laid down a rule that one shouldn’t confess or receive the confession of shared offenses. Yet here the whole saṅgha has committed the same offense. So what should we do?” </p>

<p class="rule"><span class="parno">42</span>“On the invitation day, the whole saṅgha in a certain monastery may have committed the same offense. Those monks should straightaway send a monk to a neighboring monastery: ‘Go and make amends for this offense. When you return, we’ll make amends for it with you.’ </p>

<p>If he’s able to do this, it’s good. If he’s not, then a competent and capable monk should inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<hr>

<p id="43"><span class="parno">43</span>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. This whole saṅgha has committed the same offense. When the Saṅgha sees another monk who is pure and free of offenses, it should make amends for this offense with him.’ Once this has been said, they can do the invitation ceremony. This is not an obstacle to doing the invitation ceremony. </p>

<p id="44"><span class="parno">44</span>On the invitation day, the whole saṅgha in a certain monastery may be unsure if it has committed the same offense. A competent and capable monk should then inform the Saṅgha: </p>

<h4>22. The cancellation of the invitation </h4>

<p id="136"><span class="parno">136</span>At that time the monks from the group of six invited correction while having uncleared offenses. </p>

<p class="rule">“You should not invite correction if you have uncleared offenses. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct. If anyone invites correction with an uncleared offense, you should get their permission and then accuse them of an offense.” </p>

<p id="137"><span class="parno">137</span>Soon afterwards, when asked for permission, the monks from the group of six refused to give it. </p>

<p class="rule">“If anyone doesn’t give their permission, you should cancel their invitation. And it should be canceled like this. On the invitation day, whether the fourteenth or the fifteenth, in the midst of the Saṅgha and in the presence of that person, you should announce: </p>

<p>‘Please, Venerables, I ask the Saṅgha to listen. Such-and-such a person has uncleared offenses. I cancel their invitation. The invitation ceremony should not be done in their presence.’ Their invitation has then been canceled.” </p>

<p id="138"><span class="parno">138</span>On one occasion the monks from the group of six—hinking to act before the good monks canceled their invitation, but having no reason for doing so—canceled the invitation of pure monks who had not committed any offenses. They also canceled the invitation of those who already had invited. </p>

<p class="rule">“When there is no reason for doing so, you should not cancel the invitation of pure monks who haven’t committed any offenses. If you do, you commit an offense of wrong conduct.

<p id="139"><span class="parno">139</span>And this is how the invitation is canceled and how it isn’t canceled. If the invitation is canceled after a three-statement invitation has been spoken and concluded, then it’s not canceled.

Or did you hear it from kings, a king’s officials, the monastics of another religion, or the lay followers of another religion?’ </p>

<p>If he says, ‘I didn’t cancel this monk’s invitation because of what I have heard, but because of what I suspect,’ he should be asked, ‘Since you’re canceling this monk’s invitation because of suspicion, what do you suspect? How do you suspect it? When did you suspect it? Where did you suspect it? Do you suspect that he’s committed an offense entailing expulsion, an offense entailing suspension, a serious offense, an offense entailing confession, an offense entailing acknowledgment, an offense of wrong conduct, or an offense of wrong speech?

<p>He might say, ‘I didn’t cancel this monk’s invitation because what I suspect. I don’t know why I canceled his invitation.’ If the accusing monk, when questioned, isn’t able to satisfy his discerning fellow monastics, they should conclude, ‘The accused monk is improperly accused.’ But if the accusing monk, when questioned, is able to satisfy his discerning fellow monastics, they should conclude, ‘The accused monk is properly accused.’ </p>

<p>If the accusing monk admits to a groundless charge of an offense entailing expulsion, he should be charged with an offense entailing suspension. The Saṅgha should then do the invitation ceremony.

<p>If those quarrelsome and argumentative monks arrive without prior notice, the resident monks should prepare seats and set out a foot stool, a foot scraper, and water for washing the feet. They should then go out to meet those monks, receive their bowls and robes, and ask if they want water to drink. Then, having distracted them, they should go outside the monastery zone and do the invitation ceremony there. When it has been done, they should say to the other monks, ‘Venerables, we have completed the invitation ceremony. Please do as you see fit.’ </p>

<p id="164"><span class="parno">164</span>If, when those monks have made an agreement about the invitation ceremony, a monk says, ‘I wish to go wandering in the country; I have business there,’ they should tell him, ‘That’s fine, but you have to do the invitation first.’ </p>

<p>If, while that monk is doing the invitation, he cancels the invitation of another monk, the other monk should tell him, ‘You have no authority over my invitation until I invite.’ </p>
