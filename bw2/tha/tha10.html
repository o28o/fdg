<h5>Kāḷudāyi</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p527"><span class="parno">527</span>"The trees are now crimson, venerable sir,
<br>They’ve shed their foliage, and are ready to fruit.
<br>They’re splendid, as if on fire;
<br>Great hero, this period is full of flavour.</p>

<p id="p528"><span class="parno">528</span>The blossoming trees are delightful,
<br>Wafting their scent all around, in all directions,
<br>They’ve shed their leaves and wish to fruit,
<br>Hero, it is time to depart from here.</p>

<p id="p529"><span class="parno">529</span>It is neither too hot nor too cold,
<br>Venerable sir, it’s a pleasant season for travelling.
<br>Let the Sākiyas and Koḷiyas see you,
<br>Facing west as you cross the Rohiṇī river.</p>

<p id="p530"><span class="parno">530</span>In hope, the field is ploughed;
<br>The seed is sown in hope;
<br>In hope, merchants travel the seas,
<br>Carrying rich cargoes.
<br>The hope that I stand for:
<br>May it succeed!</p>

<p id="p531"><span class="parno">531</span>Again and again, they sow the seed;
<br>Again and again, the king of gods sends rain;
<br>Again and again, farmers plough the field;
<br>Again and again, grain is produced for the nation.</p>

<p id="p532"><span class="parno">532</span>Again and again, the beggars wander,
<br>Again and again, the donors give,
<br>Again and again, when the donors have given,
<br>Again and again, they go to their place in heaven.</p>

<p id="p533"><span class="parno">533</span>A hero of vast wisdom purifies seven generations
<br>Of the family in which they’re born.
<br>Sakya, I believe you’re the king of kings,
<br>Since you fathered the one who is truly called a sage.</p>

<p id="p534"><span class="parno">534</span>The father of the great sage is named Suddhodana;
<br>But the Buddha’s mother is named Māyā.
<br>Having borne the Bodhisatta in her womb,
<br>She rejoices in the heaven of the Thirty-Three.</p>

<p id="p535"><span class="parno">535</span>When she died and passed away from here,
<br>She was blessed with divine sensual pleasures;
<br>Rejoicing in the five kinds of sensual pleasures,
<br>Gotamī is surrounded by those hosts of gods."</p>

<p id="p536"><span class="parno">536</span>"I’m the son of the Buddha, the incomparable Angīrasa, the poised — 
<br>I bear the unbearable.
<br>You, Sakya, are my father’s father;
<br>Gotama, you are my grandfather in the Dhamma."</p>
</div>
<h5>Ekavihāriya</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p537"><span class="parno">537</span>If no-one else is found
<br>In front or behind,
<br>It’s extremely pleasant,
<br>Dwelling alone in a forest grove.</p>

<p id="p538"><span class="parno">538</span>Come now, I’ll go alone
<br>To the wilderness praised by the Buddha.
<br>It’s pleasant for a monk
<br>Dwelling alone and resolute.</p>

<p id="p539"><span class="parno">539</span>Alone and self-disciplined,
<br>I’ll quickly enter the delightful forest,
<br>Which gives joy to meditators,
<br>And is frequented by rutting elephants.</p>

<p id="p540"><span class="parno">540</span>In Sītavana, so full of flowers,
<br>In a cool mountain cave,
<br>I’ll bathe my limbs
<br>And walk meditation alone.</p>

<p id="p541"><span class="parno">541</span>When will I dwell alone,
<br>Without a companion,
<br>In the great wood, so delightful,
<br>My task complete, free of defilements?</p>

<p id="p542"><span class="parno">542</span>This is what I want to do:
<br>May my wish succeed!
<br>I’ll make it happen myself:
<br>No-one can do someone else’s duty.</p>

<p id="p543"><span class="parno">543</span>Fastening my armour,
<br>I’ll enter the forest.
<br>I won’t leave here
<br>Until I have attained the end of defilements.</p>

<p id="p544"><span class="parno">544</span>As the cool breeze blows
<br>With fragrant scent,
<br>I’ll split ignorance apart,
<br>Sitting on the mountain-peak.</p>

<p id="p545"><span class="parno">545</span>In a forest grove covered with blossoms,
<br>In a cave so very cool,
<br>I take pleasure in Giribbaja,
<br>Happy with the happiness of freedom.</p>

<p id="p546"><span class="parno">546</span>My intentions are fulfilled
<br>Like the moon on the fifteenth day.
<br>With the utter ending of all defilements,
<br>Now there is no more rebirth into any state of existence.</p>
</div>
<h5>Mahākappina</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p547"><span class="parno">547</span>If you’re prepared for the future,
<br>Both the good and the bad,
<br>Then those who look for your weakness,
<br>Whether enemies or well-wishers, will find none.</p>

<p id="p548"><span class="parno">548</span>One who has fulfilled, developed,
<br>And gradually consolidated
<br>Mindfulness of breathing
<br>As taught by the Buddha:
<br>They light up the world,
<br>Like the moon freed from a cloud.</p>

<p id="p549"><span class="parno">549</span>Yes, my mind is clean,
<br>Measureless, and well-developed;
<br>It is broken through and uplifted — 
<br>It radiates in every direction.</p>

<p id="p550"><span class="parno">550</span>The wise person lives on
<br>Even after loss of wealth;
<br>But without gaining wisdom
<br>Even a rich person doesn’t really live.</p>

<p id="p551"><span class="parno">551</span>Understanding questions what is learned;
<br>Understanding grows fame and reputation;
<br>A person who has understanding
<br>Finds happiness even among sufferings.</p>

<p id="p552"><span class="parno">552</span>It’s not something just for today;
<br>It isn’t incredible or astonishing.
<br>When you’re born, you die — 
<br>What’s astonishing about that?</p>

<p id="p553"><span class="parno">553</span>For anyone who is born,
<br>Death always follows after living.
<br>Everyone who is born here dies here;
<br>Such is the nature of living beings.</p>

<p id="p554"><span class="parno">554</span>The things that are useful for the living
<br>Are of no use for the dead — 
<br>Not fame, not celebrity,
<br>Not praise by ascetics and brahmins;
<br>For the dead, there is only weeping.</p>

<p id="p555"><span class="parno">555</span>And weeping impairs the eye and the body;
<br>Complexion, health, and intelligence decline.
<br>Your enemies rejoice;
<br>But your well-wishers are not happy.</p>

<p id="p556"><span class="parno">556</span>So you should wish that those who stay in your family
<br>Have understanding and learning,
<br>And do their duty though the power of understanding,
<br>Just as you’d cross a full river by boat.</p>
</div>
<h5>Cūḷapanthaka</h5>
<div class="verse">
<p id="p557"><span class="parno">557</span>My progress was slow,
<br>I was despised in the past;
<br>My brother turned me away,
<br>Saying, "Go home now".</p>

<p id="p558"><span class="parno">558</span>Turned away at the gate
<br>Of the Saṅgha’s monastery,
<br>I stood there sadly,
<br>Longing for the teaching.</p>

<p id="p559"><span class="parno">559</span>Then Blessed One came
<br>And touched my head.
<br>Taking me by the arm,
<br>He brought me into the Saṅgha’s monastery.</p>

<p id="p560"><span class="parno">560</span>The teacher, out of compassion,
<br>Gave me a foot-wiping cloth, saying:
<br>"Focus your awareness
<br>Exclusively on this clean cloth."</p>

<p id="p561"><span class="parno">561</span>After I had listened to his words,
<br>I dwelt delighting in his teaching,
<br>Practising <i>samādhi</i>
<br>For the attainment of the highest goal.</p>

<p id="p562"><span class="parno">562</span>I know my past life;
<br>My divine eye is clarified;
<br>I’ve attained the three knowledges,
<br>And fulfilled the Buddha’s instructions.</p>

<p id="p563"><span class="parno">563</span>I, Panthaka, created a thousand
<br>Images of myself,
<br>And sat in the delightful mango grove
<br>Until the time for the meal offering was announced.</p>

<p id="p564"><span class="parno">564</span>Then the teacher sent to me
<br>A messenger to announce the time.
<br>When the time was announced,
<br>I flew to him through the air.</p>

<p id="p565"><span class="parno">565</span>I paid homage to the teacher’s feet,
<br>And sat to one side.
<br>When he knew I was seated,
<br>The teacher received the offering.</p>

<p id="p566"><span class="parno">566</span>Recipient of gifts from the whole world,
<br>Receiver of sacrifices,
<br>Field of merit for humanity,
<br>He received the offering.</p>
</div>

<br>Propelled by the mechanism of deeds.
<br>But existence ends in perishing;
<br>Separated, the body perishes.</p>

<p id="p575"><span class="parno">575</span>Those blind, unawakened people
<br>Who think of this body as theirs,
<br>Swell the horrors of the charnel-ground,
<br>And take up rebirth again in some state of existence.</p>

<p id="p576"><span class="parno">576</span>Those who avoid this body,

<div class="verse">
