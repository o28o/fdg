      <h2>Rule Index</h2>

      <div class="blockn ruleindexnormal">
        <p>This index lists the summaries of the training rules given in this book, organized by topic. The Sekhiya rules have not been included, because they are short, deal almost exclusively with etiquette, and are already organized by topic in their own chapter. I have included short summaries of the adhikaraṇa-samatha rules, even though these summaries do not appear in the chapter discussing those rules.</p>

        <p>The rules are divided into five major categories, dealing with Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Communal harmony, and the etiquette of a contemplative. The first three categories—the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path that make up the training in heightened virtue—show in particular how the training rules relate to the Buddhist path as a whole.</p>

        <p>These five categories are not sharply distinct types. Instead, they are more like the colors in the band of light thrown off by a prism—discernibly different, but shading into one another with no sharp dividing lines. Right Speech, for instance, often shades into Communal harmony, just as Right Livelihood shades into personal etiquette. Thus the placement of a particular rule in one category rather than another is occasionally somewhat arbitrary. There are a few cases—such as <a href="Section0020.html#Pc46">Pc 46</a> &amp; <a href="Section0024.html#Pc85">85</a>—where the reason for the placement of the rule will become clear only after a reading of the detailed discussion of the rule in the text.</p>
      </div>

      <h3 id="sigil_toc_id_30">Right Speech</h3>

      <div class="blockn ruleindexnormal">
