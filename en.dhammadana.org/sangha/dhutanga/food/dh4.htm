<h1 id="_"><span id="titre">dhutaṅga sapadānacāri</span></h1><br />
<h2 id="ch-----1">Meaning of the sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</h2>
<p>The Pali term "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacāra</span>» means "circulating without skipping any house», that is to say proceeding from house to house, while refraining from crossing one without stopping.</p>
<p>"<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāna</span>» = "fact to cross houses (in another context, this term means "donation")»; "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">apadāna</span>" = "not to skip houses"; "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadāna</span>" = "all houses, one after another, without skipping any"</p>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who cultivates the habit of collecting his food while stopping in front of every house, without skipping any, is therefore called "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span>". When this practice is conveniently done, with diligence and steadiness, with the determination of not breaking it, we say that there is "<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārikaṅga</span>" (a state of mind related to the food collection without skipping any house).</p>
<p>Noble beings constantly train into developing <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mettā</span> towards all beings, whatever/whoever they may, without choosing. Moved by a similar state of mind, a noble <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> will accept the food offered in front of every house found on his way, without choosing. There could be houses where a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> likes to proceed collecting his food, and others that he prefers to avoid. When a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> practises the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span>, he is spared from doing all these selections that contribute in increasing but <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">lobha</span> and <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dosa</span>. He also accepts, with a pure state of mind, the food from each house found on his way, without having to think over this point. We consider that the state of mind of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> does prevail when the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who collects his food doesn't choose the social position of his donors, when he doesn't choose houses, when he doesn't choose that which is of low, middle or high ranged quality, and when he stops in front of each house found on his way.</p>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who adopts this <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> stops in front of all houses found on his way, even in front of those where it is likely that nobody will give him anything whatsoever. The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> can stop in front of the houses of a street, only if he stopped in front of all houses of the street where he finds himself. He can choose the street where to proceed to, but must stop in front of all houses found on his way from his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vihāra</span> onward. As soon as he obtains his food in sufficient quantity, he stops his collection round. As soon as he already retraced his steps, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> can accept the food that people come to bring him, but he mustn't stop anywhere whatsoever.</p>
<p>Each practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> is free the adopt the determinations he wishes to. Thus, a few <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> attribute at first to themselves a maximum number of houses (in front of which they daily stop) and they stick to them. That is to say when this number of houses is reached, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> returns to his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vihāra</span>, even if he hasn't obtained sufficient food.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----2">Adoption of the sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</h2>
<p>For adopting this <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span>, it is convenient to pronounce the following sentence whether in Pali, whether in the language of one's choice...</p>
<h4>In Pali:</h4>
<p class="pi" xml:lang="pi">«loluppacāraṃ paṭikkhipāmi, sapadānacārikaṅgaṃ samādhiyāmi.»</p>
<h4>In English:</h4>
<p>«I renounce to collect my food out of attachment, I will train into collecting my food while stopping in front of each house without skipping any.»</p>

<h2 id="ch-----3">The three kinds of practitioners of the sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</h2>
<p>According to restrictions, there do exist three kinds of practitioners of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi"><strong>ukkaṭṭha</strong> sapadānacārika</span>, the <strong>noble</strong> practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi"> sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span></li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi"><strong>majjhima</strong> sapadānacārika</span>, the <strong>intermediate</strong> practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi"> sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span></li>
<li><span class="pi" xml:lang="pi"><strong>mudu</strong> sapadānacārika</span>, the <strong>ordinary</strong> practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi"> sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span></li>
</ol>
<h3>1. the noble practitioner</h3>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who is a noble practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span> doesn't accept any food offered by someone coming in advance out of a house in front of which he hasn't passed yet, offered by someone coming late out of a house in front of which he has already passed, or offered by stay-inn (or a shop, etc.). He only accepts food offered by someone coming out of a house in front of which he is stopping.</p>
<p>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who is a noble practitioner of this <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> can also accept food offered while giving his bowl to the person who, coming out of the house in front of which he stopped, wishes to offer him some food. Indeed, the renown <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">mahāthera</span> Mahā Kassapa, who is unequalled in the field of the practice of the 13&nbsp;<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span>, once gave his bowl to the king Sakka, so that the later easily pours food into it.</p>
<h3>2. the intermediate practitioner</h3>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who is an intermediate practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span> can accept any food offered by someone coming in advance out of a house in front of which he hasn't passed yet, offered by someone coming late out of a house in front of which he has already passed, offered by someone coming out of a house in front of which he is stopping, or offered by stay-inn (or a shop, etc.). On the other hand, he won't go waiting in front of the house of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyaka</span> who invited him to do so the very same day, hoping to get some food from him.</p>
<h3>3. the ordinary practitioner</h3>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who is an ordinary practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span> can go waiting in front of the house of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyaka</span> who invited him to do so the very same day, hoping to get some food from him.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----4">The advantages of the sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</h2>
<p>By practising the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span>, we can benefit with the following advantages...</p>
<ol>
<li>We benefit (we can benefit) each day with new <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyakas</span>.</li>
<li>2. We cultivate a feeling of benevolence towards all <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyakas</span> in an even-minded manner, in the same way as the full moon that shines equally shines on all beings.</li>
<li>3. We get rid of avarice.</li>
<li>4. Development of compassion towards all <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyakas</span> in an even-minded manner.</li>
<li>5. We are free from faults by coming close to a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dāyaka</span> (we go close to him without needing to be requested for it, as we go there only for food collection).</li>
<li>6. We can refuse any invitation.</li>
<li>7. We are not an individual who needs to get food brought to himself.</li>
<li>8. We only benefit with a convenient means to provide for what we need, while being able to be contented by little.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="rem">Remark:</span> the practice of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> alone enables one to understand its advantages.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----5">The way to break the sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</h2>
<p>From the moment when a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>, who practises the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span>, skips a single village, a street or a house, in the hope of obtaining some tastier food or food in larger quantity, he breaks his <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span>.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----6">The points to be observed by the practitioner of the sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</h2>
<p>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who practises the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅgas</span> should leave early morning for his daily food collection, as if he comes across a danger at a spot, he will have sufficient time to proceed elsewhere for getting his meal.</p>
<p>At the entrance spot of a village, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must pay attention to the surrounding by watching if there are not elephants, horses, buffaloes, cows, etc. If he glimpses something likely to be (to him or to the donors who go out of their house) a source of danger, in a street (or in a village), he proceed to another street (or village).</p>
<p>If the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> doesn't obtain anything in this village, in a street or a house, he must remind himself of it and not proceed ever more back to it/them.</p>
<p>If he obtains something in a village, in a street or a house, even in very little quantity, he mustn't cross it next time he passes in front of it.</p>
<p>It is absolutely inconvenient for a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>, who is a practitioner of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span>, to accept an invitation for a meal. However, such a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> will be entitled to accept that a donor takes his bowl for going to pour food into it and comes back to him, gives him back his bowl, thus offers him food. He can accept food offered in this way from anybody who comes close to him, even if that person comes from a spot that is not on his way of even if the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is on the return way. In such cases, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span> will not be broken.</p>
<p>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who practises the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</span> must not accept food that is specially prepared for the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>.</p>
<p>It is not convenient for a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> to enter a village, to which he frequently proceeds, to rejoice from the food he guesses he will be offered. He only collects food from houses to houses, without hoping anything whatsoever.</p>

<h2 id="ch-----7">Encouragement to observe the sapadānacārika dhutaṅga</h2>
<p>Buddha held the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga sapadānacārika</span> in great esteem, as a practice likely to eradicate greed for food and to give rise to feeling of compassion towards all donors. Owing to the great esteem he had for this practice, he adopted it himself, when he went collecting his food in Kapilavatthu, without skipping any house.</p>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who practises this <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhutaṅga</span> doesn't see any defect in any spot. His mind is always pure and serene. He cannot harbour any feeling of hatred towards other <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>. Being cautious about not missing any house, he naturally develops a great feeling of vigilance.</p>
