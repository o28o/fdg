<h2 id="ch-----1">To whom serves the vinaya?</h2>
<p class="let">The <span class="pit" title="monastic discipline" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> allows benefiting from the best possible conditions to train in reducing attachments. This is what gives the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> the means to follow the Middle Path and remain on it. It forces the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> to remain aware of each of his actions at all times, because it is only through it that it is possible to avoid any lapses. It prevents him from squandering time and energy in futile things by focusing on what is wholesome and beneficial. The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> allows the <span class="pit" title="monks" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> to be irreproachable in any situation, and to offer the laity who support them an example of purity, balance and wisdom. Besides, the only visible criterion defining the quality of a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is his capacity to observe the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> is a collection of guidelines permitting the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> to cultivate the best possible <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīla</span> in the best possble manner. Since <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">sīla</span> is the basis of all action within the <span class="pit" title="wisdom path" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who neglects the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> is an opportunist. The danger is that he risks to parasite on the community that he represents, because his negligent attitude could draw a lot of people to the wrong path. Therefore, it is very important to train correctly in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span>. As long as this is not put in practice seriously, its inestimable benefits cannot be understood. In the same way that a profession could have been studied for years, but it is only through practice that it can truly be known. With regard to profession, one could say that the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is, among other things, a professional in conduct.</p>
<p>The concept of <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is defined as much by detachment as by conduct. Besides, disregard for rules of conduct is essentially due to problems related to attachment. Simultaneously, the fact of respecting these rules contributes to detachment.</p>
<p>The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> also permits the <strong>preservation</strong> of the Buddha's teachings. Without the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span>, it is impossible to have a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>. Without the <span class="pit" title="community of monks" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>, the teaching of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> could not be transmitted, because only a community organised by and composed of beings who have fully realised the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> &ndash; <span class="pit" title="cessation of the mental and physical phenomena" xml:lang="pi">nibbāna</span> &ndash; is capable of preserving this intact. The Buddha said if his teaching disappeared, it would be exclusively the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span>' fault; because of their lack of respect for the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span>.</p>
<h3>The ten benefits of the vinaya</h3>
<ol>
<li>Approval of the rules of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> by the members of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>: the various points of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> are established so as to preserve all forms of respect from one to others.</li>
<li>Harmony and serenity for the members of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>: the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> foresees all methods of solving problems of discord or conflicts.</li>
<li>Possibility of expelling those <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> of reckless conduct: with the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> as authority, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> can banish any <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> who trouble the community.</li>
<li>Security for the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> who have great respect for the rules of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span>: people always prefer to help more those who show great virtue.</li>
<li>Protection against great dangers in the present existence: the adoption of a right life conduct &ndash; including numerous abstinences &ndash; reduces considerably the opportunities propitious to dangerous situations.</li>
<li>Protection against great dangers in the next existence: the cultivation of great virtue contributes to develop merit so as to benefit from favourable conditions in the next existence.</li>
<li>Interest in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> by persons who are not yet interested: Those beings who have an exemplary life discipline naturally inspire a lot of confidence, attention and interest.</li>
<li>Increased interest in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span> by persons who are already interested: (for the same reason).</li>
<li>Stability and durability of the teachings of Buddha: so that a teaching remains intact, it is imperative that those who transmit it are in perfect agreement. This can only be achieved within a community organised around a common code of conduct.</li>
<li>Give rise to consideration and worth towards one's own conduct: the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> serves as a reference allowing to validate at any time the quality of one's conduct.</li>

<h2 id="ch-----2">Respect of the vinaya</h2>
<h3>Respect towards the laity</h3>
<p class="let">Lay people are very devoted to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span>. They generally show a lot of respect towards <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> and support them generously. They deserve to have a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">saṃgha</span> worthy of this name. It would be shameful to profit from this generosity in order to enjoy a comfortable existence. The <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> have the duty to offer the laity an irreproachable community. One must not forget that they represent the example to be followed. It is therefore imperative that the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> train relentlessly to excel in moral discipline, patience, the practice of detachment, etc. In striving for this, they must follow the teachings of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">dhamma</span>, the instructions and advice from the ancients.</p>
<p>A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> should constantly concern himself to follow correctly the rules of the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span>. For this reason, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> must make efforts to know all the rules of conduct (<span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">pātimokkha</span>). Whenever he is unsure or misunderstands a rule, he must refer to another <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> who knows and understands it.</p>
<h3>Adaptation</h3>
<p>It is essential not to neglect aspects of the <span class="pit" title="monastic discipline" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> under the pretext of "adapting" to the situation. Nothing in the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> is left to chance, it is perfectly valid at any epoch and place. Anyone who delights in adopting right conduct will not encounter problems. On the contrary, he obtains for his needs with great ease. It is all persons and all things that naturally adapt to him, not the reverse. This is how it works in reality. Anyone who makes the effort to practice right conduct can verify this. A <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>'s conduct must never be influenced by any culture, nor by any bad habits that <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> around him may have. However, in conditions likely to cause danger, the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> are allowed to adapt in consequence. For example, in a very cold country, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> will not be at fault if he wears a hat and shoes. The Buddha rejected all extremes. Moreover, this is why the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> is relatively flexible concerning <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> who are ill.</p>
<h3>The law first of all</h3>
<p>The Buddha told the <span class="pit" title="monks" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhus</span> that they had to abide by all the laws of the State where they were, even if some of these are contrary to the <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">vinaya</span> (in which case there would be no offence). In the same way, a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> is obliged to follow all the rules of the monastery where he lives. If a law or rule constrains to commit a negative action or adopt unwholesome behaviour, this means that the area is not suitable for a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span>.</p>
<h3>Common sense</h3>
<p>It is inestimable good fortune that Buddha delivered the method for perfect virtue. Therefore, each <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> should appeal to his common sense in training in discipline, and not to submit blindly to the established rules. When a <span class="pi" xml:lang="pi">bhikkhu</span> has a doubt, being uncertain as to whether such or such action is an offence or not, he must abstain from it. Thus, he is certain of not being at fault.</p>
