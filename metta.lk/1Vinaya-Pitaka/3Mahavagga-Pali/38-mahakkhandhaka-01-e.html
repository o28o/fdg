<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>1.<B> </B>Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the Ajap&agrave;la Banyan tree to the Mucalinda tree. And when He had reached it, He sat cross-legged at the foot of the Mucalinda tree uninterruptedly during seven days, enjoying the bliss of emancipation.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>2. At that time a great cloud appeared out of season, rainy weather which lasted seven days, cold weather, storms, and darkness. And the n&agrave;ga (or serpent) king Mucalinda came out from his abode, and seven times encircled the body of the Blessed One with his windings, and kept extending his large hood over the Blessed One's head, thinking to himself: `May no coldness (touch) the Blessed One I may no heat (touch) the Blessed One! May no vexation by gadflies and gnats, by storms and heat of the sun, and reptiles (touch) the Blessed One!'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>3. And at the end of those seven days, when the n&agrave;ga king Mucalinda saw the open, cloudless sky, he loosened his windings from the body of the Blessed One, made his own appearance disappear, created the appearance of a youth, and stationed himself in front of the Blessed One, raising his clasped hands, and paying reverence to<B> </B>the Blessed One.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>4. And the Blessed One, perceiving that, on this occasion, pronounced this solemn utterance: `Happy is the solitude of him who is full of joy, who has learnt the Truth, who sees (the Truth). Happy is freedom from malice in this world, (self-)restraint towards all beings that have life. Happy is freedom from lust in this world, getting beyond all desires; the putting away of that pride which comes from the thought "I am!" This truly is the highest happiness!'</FONT> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>2. At that time Tapussa and Bhallika, two merchants, came travelling on the road from Ukkala (Orissa) to that place. Then a deity who had been (in a former life) a blood-relation of the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika, thus spoke to the merchants [\q 82/] Tapussa and Bhallika: `Here, my noble friends, at the foot of the R&agrave;j&agrave;yatana tree, is staying the Blessed One, who has just become Sambuddha. Go and show your reverence to Him, the Blessed One, by (offering Him) rice-cakes and lumps of honey. Long will this be to you for a good and for a blessing.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>3. And the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika took rice-cakes and lumps of honey, and went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached Him and respectfully saluted the Blessed One, they stationed themselves near Him; standing near Him, the merchants Tapussa and Bhallika thus addressed the Blessed One: `May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept from us these rice-cakes and lumps of honey, that that may long be to us for a good and for a blessing!'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>4. Then the Blessed One thought: `The Tath&agrave;gatas</FONT><A HREF="#N_12_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (12)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> do not accept (food) with their hands. Now [\q 83/] with what shall I accept the rice-cakes and lumps of honey?' then the four Mah&agrave;r&agrave;ja gods</FONT><A HREF="#N_13_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (13)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, understanding by the power of their minds the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the Blessed One, offered to the Blessed One from the four quarters (of the horizon) four bowls made of stone (saying), `May, O Lord, the Blessed One accept herewith the rice-cakes and the lumps of honey!' the Blessed One accepted those new stone bowls; and therein He received the rice-cakes and honey lumps, and those, when He had received, He ate.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>5.

These were the first in the world to become lay-disciples (of the Buddha) by the formula which contained (only) the dyad</FONT><A HREF="#N_15_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (15)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">.</FONT> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>1. Then the Blessed One, at the end of those seven days, arose from that state of meditation, and went from the foot of the R&agrave;j&agrave;yatana tree to the Ajap&agrave;la Banyan tree. And when He had reached it, the Blessed One stayed there at the foot of the Ajap&agrave;la Banyan tree.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>2. Then in the mind of the Blessed One, who was alone, and had retired into solitude, the following thought arose: `I have penetrated this Doctrine which is profound, difficult to perceive and to understand, which brings quietude of heart, which is exalted, which is unattainable by reasoning, abstruse, intelligible (only) to the wise. This people, on the other hand, is given to desire, intent upon desire, delighting in desire. To this people, therefore, who [\q 85/] are given, to desire, intent upon desire, delighting in desire, the law of causality and the chain of causation will be a matter difficult to understand; most difficult for them to understand will be also the extinction of all sa&iuml;kharas, the getting rid of all the substrata (of existence</FONT><A HREF="#N_16_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (16)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">), the destruction of desire, the absence of passion, quietude of heart, Nirv&agrave;na! Now if I proclaim the Doctrine, and other men are not able to understand my preaching, there would result but weariness and annoyance to me.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>3. And then the following . . .</FONT><A HREF="#N_17_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (17)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> stanzas, unheard before, occurred to the Blessed One: `With great pains have I acquired it. Enough! Why should I now proclaim it? This Doctrine will not be easy to understand to beings that are lost in lust and hatred.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`Given to lust, surrounded with thick darkness, they will not see what is repugnant (to their minds), abstruse, profound, difficult to perceive, and subtle.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>4. When the Blessed One pondered over this matter, His mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not to preach the Doctrine. Then Brahm&agrave; [\q 86/] Sahampati</FONT><A HREF="#N_18_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (18)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">, understanding by the power of his mind the reflection which had arisen in the mind of the Blessed One, thought: `Alas! The world perishes! Alas! The world is destroyed! If the mind of the Tath&agrave;gata, of the Holy, of the Absolute Sambuddha inclines itself to remain in quiet, and not to preach the Doctrine.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>5. Then Brahm&agrave; Sahampati disappeared from Brahm&agrave;'s world, and appeared before the Blessed One (as quickly) as a strong man might stretch his bent arm out, or draw back his out-stretched arm.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>6. And Brahm&agrave; Sahampati adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, and putting his right knee on the ground, raised his joined hands towards the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: `Lord, may the Blessed One preach the Doctrine! May the perfect one preach the Doctrine! There are beings whose mental eyes are darkened by scarcely any dust; but if they do not hear the Doctrine, they cannot attain salvation. These will understand the Doctrine.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>7. Thus spoke Brahm&agrave; Sahampati; and when he had thus spoken, he further said: `The Dhamma hitherto manifested in the country of Magadha has been impure, thought out by contaminated men. But do Thou now open the door of the Immortal</FONT><A HREF="#N_19_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (19)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">; let them hear the Doctrine discovered by the Spotless One!</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`As a man standing on a rock, on mountain's [\q 87/] top, might overlook the people all around, thus, O Wise One, ascending to the highest palace of Truth, look down, all-seeing one, upon the people lost in suffering, overcome by birth and decay, Thou, who hast freed Thyself from suffering!</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`Arise, O Hero; O Victorious One! Wander through the world, O Leader of the pilgrim band, who Thyself art free from debt. May the Blessed One preach the Doctrine; there will be people who can understand it!'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>8. When he had spoken thus, the Blessed One said to Brahm&agrave; Sahampati: `The following thought, Brahm&agrave;, has occurred to me: "I have penetrated this Doctrine (&amp;c., down to end of sect.2)." And also, Brahm&agrave;, the following . . .</FONT><A HREF="#N_20_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (20)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> stanzas have presented themselves to my mind, which had not been heard (by me) before: "With great pains (&amp;c., down to end of sect.3)." When I pondered over this matter, Brahm&agrave;, my mind became inclined to remain in quiet, and not to preach the Doctrine.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>9. And a second time Brahm&agrave; Sahampati said to the Blessed One: `Lord, may the Blessed One preach the Doctrine (&amp;c., as in sects. 6, 7).' and for the second time the Blessed One said to Brahm&agrave; Sahampati: `The following thought (&amp;c., as before).'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>10. And a third time Brahm&agrave; Sahampati said to the Blessed One: `Lord, may the Blessed One preach the Doctrine (&amp;c., as before).'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>Then the Blessed One, when He had heard Brahm&agrave;'s solicitation, looked, full of compassion towards sentient beings, over the world, with His (all-perceiving) eye of a Buddha. And the Blessed One, looking over the world with His eye of a Buddha, [\q 88/] saw beings whose mental eyes were darkened by scarcely any dust, and beings whose eyes were covered by much dust, beings sharp of sense and blunt of sense, of good disposition and of bad disposition, easy to instruct and difficult to instruct, some of them seeing the dangers of future life and of sin.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>11<B>. </B>As, in a pond of blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, some blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, do not emerge over the water, but thrive hidden under the water; and other blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in the water, reach to the surface of the water; and other blue lotuses, or water-roses, or white lotuses, born in the water, grown up in<B> </B>the water, stand emerging out of the water, and the water does not touch them,-</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>12<B>. </B>Thus the Blessed One, looking over the world with His eye of a Buddha, saw beings whose mental eyes were darkened (&amp;c., the text repeats sect.10) ; and when He had thus seen them, He addressed Brahm&agrave; Sahampati in the following stanza: `Wide opened is the door of the Immortal to all who have ears to hear; let them send forth faith to meet it. The Dhamma sweet and good I spake not, Brahm&agrave;, despairing of the weary task, to men.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>13. Then Brahm&agrave; Sahampati understood: `The Blessed One grants my request that He should preach the Doctrine.' And he bowed down before the Blessed One, and passed round Him with his right side towards Him; and then he straightway disappeared.</FONT> <BR>

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>1.<B> </B>Now the Blessed One thought: `To whom shall I<B> </B>preach the Doctrine first?

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>2<B>. </B>Then an invisible deity said to the Blessed One: K&agrave;l&agrave;ma has died, Lord, seven days ago.' And knowledge sprang up in the Blessed One's mind that &acirc;&euml;&agrave;ra K&agrave;l&agrave;ma had died seven days ago. And the Blessed One thought: `Highly noble was &acirc;&euml;&agrave;ra K&agrave;l&agrave;ma. If he had heard my Doctrine, he would easily have understood it.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>3. Then the Blessed One thought: `To whom shall I preach the Doctrine first? Who will understand this Doctrine easily?' And the Blessed One thought: `There is Uddaka R&agrave;maputta I ; he is clever, wise, and learned; long since have the eye of his mind been darkened by scarcely any dust. What if I were to preach the Doctrine first to Uddaka R&agrave;maputta? He will easily understand this Doctrine.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>4. Then an invisible deity said to the Blessed One: `Uddaka R&agrave;maputta has died, Lord, yesterday evening.' And knowledge arose in the Blessed One's mind that Uddaka R&agrave;maputta had died the previous evening, and the Blessed One thought: [\q 90/] `Highly noble was Uddaka R&agrave;maputta. If he had heard my Doctrine, he would easily have understood it.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>5. Then the Blessed One thought: `To whom shall I preach the Doctrine first? Who will understand this Doctrine easily?' And the Blessed One thought: `The five bhikkhus</FONT><A HREF="#N_22_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (22)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> have done many services to me</FONT><A HREF="#N_23_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (23)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">; they attended on me during the time of my exertions (to attain sanctification by undergoing austerities). What if I were to preach the Doctrine first to the five bhikkhus?'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>6. Now the Blessed One thought: `Where do the five bhikkhus dwell now?' And the Blessed One saw by the, power of His divine, clear vision, surpassing that of men, that the five bhikkhus were living at Benares, in the deer park Isipatana</FONT><A HREF="#N_24_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (24)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">. And the Blessed One, after having remained at Uruvel&agrave; as long as He thought fit, went forth to Benares.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>7. Now Upaka, a man belonging, to the &acirc;j&atilde;vaka sect (i.e. the sect of naked ascetics), saw the Blessed One travelling on the road, between Gay&agrave; and the Bodhi tree; and when he saw Him, he said to the Blessed One: `Your countenance, friend, is serene; your complexion is pure and bright. In whose [\q 91/] name, friend, have you retired from the world? Who is your teacher? Whose Doctrine do you profess?'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>8. When Upaka the &acirc;j&atilde;vaka had spoken thus, the Blessed One addressed him in the following stanzas: `I have overcome all foes; I am all-wise; I am free from stains in every way; I have left everything; and have obtained emancipation by the destruction of desire. Having myself gained knowledge, whom should I call my master? I have no teacher; no one is equal to me; in the world of men and of gods no being is like me. I am the holy one in this world, I am the highest Teacher, I alone am the absolute Sambuddha; I have gained coolness (by the extinction of all passion) and have obtained Nirv&agrave;na. To found the kingdom of Truth I go to the city of the Kasis (Benares); I will beat the drum of the Immortal in the darkness of this world.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>9. (Upaka replied): `You profess then, friend, to be the holy, absolute Jina.' </FONT><A HREF="#N_25_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (25)</FONT></A> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>(The Buddha said): `Like me are all jinas who have reached extinction of the &agrave;savas</FONT><A HREF="#N_26_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (26)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">; I have overcome (gita me) all states of sinfulness'; therefore, Upaka, am I the Jina.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>When He had spoken thus, Upaka the &acirc;j&atilde;vaka replied: `It may be so, friend;' shook his head, took another road, and went away.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>10. And the Blessed One, wandering from place to place, came to Benares, to the deer park Isipatana, to the place where the five bhikkhus were. And [\q 92/] the five bhikkhus saw the Blessed One coming from afar; when they saw Him, they concerted with each other, saying, `Friends, there comes the sama&otilde;a Gotama, who lives in abundance, who has given up his exertions, and who has turned to an abundant life. Let us not salute him; nor rise from our seats when he approaches; nor take his bowl and his robe from his hands. But let us put there a seat; if he likes, let him sit down.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>11. But when the Blessed One gradually approached near unto those five bhikkhus, the five bhikkhus kept not their agreement. They went forth to meet the Blessed One; one took His bowl and His robe, another prepared a seat, a third one brought water for the washing of the feet, a foot-stool, and a towel</FONT><A HREF="#N_27_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (27)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">.

He had three palaces, one for winter, one for summer, one for the rainy season. In the palace for the rainy season he lived during the four months (of that season), surrounded with female musicians among whom no [\q 103/] man was, and he did not descend from that palace (all that time).

One would think it was a cemetery one had fallen into</FONT><A HREF="#N_45_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (45)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">. When he saw that, the evils (of the life he led) manifested themselves to him; his mind became weary (of worldly pleasures).

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>3. And Yasa, the noble youth, put on his gilt slippers, and went to the gate of his house. Non-human beings opened the gate, in order that no being might prevent Yasa the noble youth's leaving the world, and going forth into the houseless state.

The deer park Isipatana.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>[\q 104/]</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>4. At that time the Blessed One, having arisen in the night, at dawn was walking up and down in the open air. And the Blessed One saw Yasa, the noble youth, coming from afar. And when He saw him, He left the place where He was walking, and sat down on a seat laid out (for Him). And Yasa, the noble youth, gave utterance near the Blessed One to that solemn exclamation: `Alas! What distress; alas! What danger!' and the Blessed One said to Yasa, the noble youth: `Here is no distress, Yasa, here is no danger. Come here, Yasa, sit down, I will teach you the Truth (Dhamma).'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>5. And Yasa, the noble youth, when he heard that there was no distress, and that there was no danger, became glad and joyful; and he put off his gilt slippers, and went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached Him and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near Him. When Yasa, the noble youth, was sitting near Him, the Blessed One preached to him in due course: that is to say, he talked about the merits obtained by alms-giving, about the duties of morality, about heaven, about the evils, the vanity, and the sinfulness of desires, and about the blessings of the abandonment of desire</FONT><A HREF="#N_46_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (46)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>6. When the Blessed One saw that the mind of Yasa, the noble youth, was prepared, impressible, free from obstacles (to understanding the Truth), elated, and believing, then He preached what is the principal Doctrine of the Buddhas, namely, suffering, [\q 105/] the cause of suffering, the cessation of suffering the path. Just as a clean cloth free from black specks properly takes the dye, thus Yasa, the noble youth, even while sitting there, obtained the pure and spotless eye of the Truth (that is, the knowledge): `Whatsoever is subject to the condition of origination is subject also to the condition of cessation.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>7. Now the mother of Yasa, the noble youth, having gone up to his palace, did not see Yasa, the noble youth, and she went to the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder (her husband), and having approached him, she said to the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder: `Your son Yasa, O householder, has disappeared.' then the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder, sent messengers on horseback to the four quarters of the horizon; and he went himself to the deer park Isipatana. Then the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder, saw on the ground the marks of the gilt slippers; and when he saw them, he followed them up.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>8. And the Blessed One saw the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder, coming from afar. On seeing him, He thought: `What if I were to effect such an exercise of miraculous power, that the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder, sitting here, should not see Yasa, the noble youth, who is sitting here also.' And the Blessed One effected such an exercise of His miraculous power.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>9. And the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder, went to the place where the Blessed One was; having approached Him, he said to the Blessed One: `Pray, Lord, has the Blessed One seen Yasa, the noble youth?'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`Well, householder, sit down. Perhaps, sitting here, you may see Yasa, the noble youth, sitting here also.' [\q 106/]</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>And the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i the householder, who thought: ,indeed, sitting here I shall see Yasa, the noble youth sitting here also !' became glad and joyful, and having respectfully saluted the Blessed One, he sat down near Him.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>10. When the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder, was sitting near Him, the Blessed One preached to him in due course; that is to say, He talked about the merits obtained by alms-giving (&amp;c., as at end of sect.5). And the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder, having seen the Truth, having mastered the Truth, having penetrated the Truth, having overcome uncertainty, having dispelled all doubts, having gained full knowledge, dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the Doctrine of the Teacher, said to the Blessed One: `Glorious, Lord ! Glorious, Lord! Just as if one should set up, Lord, what had been overturned, or should reveal what had been hidden, or should point out the way to one who had lost his way, or should bring a lamp into the darkness, in order that those who had eyes might see visible things, thus has the Blessed One preached the Doctrine in many ways. I take my refuge, Lord, in the Blessed One, and in the Dhamma, and in the fraternity of bhikkhus; may the Blessed One receive me from this day forth while my life lasts as a disciple who has taken his refuge in Him.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>This was the first person in the world who became a lay-disciple by the formula of the holy triad.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>11. And Yasa, the noble youth, while instruction was administered (by the Buddha) to his father, contemplated the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood; and his mind became free from attachment to the world, and was [\q 107/] released from the &agrave;savas. Then the Blessed One thought: `Yasa, the noble youth, while instruction was administered to his father, has contemplated the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood; and his mind has become free from attachment to the world, and has become released from the &agrave;savas. It is impossible that Yasa, the noble youth, should return to the world and enjoy pleasures, as he did before, when he lived in his house. What if I were now to put an end to that exertion of my miraculous power.' And the Blessed One put an end to that exertion of His miraculous power.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>12. Then the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder, saw Yasa, the noble youth, sitting there. On seeing him he said to Yasa, the noble youth: `My son Yasa, your mother is absorbed in lamentation and grief; restore your mother to life.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>13. Then Yasa, the noble youth, looked at the Blessed One. And the Blessed One said to the se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i, the householder:, `What do you think then, O householder? That Yasa has (first) won only an imperfect</FONT><A HREF="#N_47_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (47)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> degree of knowledge and insight into the Truth, as you have yourself? Or that rather he was contemplating the stage of knowledge which he had seen with his mind and understood; and that his mind has thus become free from attachment to the world, and has become released from the &agrave;savas? Now would it then be possible, O householder, that Yasa should return to the world and enjoy pleasures as he did before, when he lived in his house?' `Not so, Lord.' [\q 108/]</FONT> </P>

Tell me that.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>(Kassapa replied): `I have seen the state of peace (i.e. Nirv&agrave;na) in which the basis of existence (upadhi</FONT><A HREF="#N_83_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (83)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">) and the obstacles to perfection (ki&otilde;cana</FONT><A HREF="#N_84_"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> (84)</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">) [\q 139/] kanal) have ceased, which is free from attachment to sensual existence, which cannot pass over into another state, which cannot be led to another state; therefore I took no more delight in sacrifices and offerings.'</FONT> </P>

Then the Venerable Uruvel&agrave; Kassapa rose from his seat, adjusted his upper robe so as to cover one shoulder, prostrated himself, inclining his head to the feet of the Blessed One, and said to the Blessed One: `My teacher, Lord, is the Blessed One, I am His pupil; my teacher, Lord, is the Blessed One, I am His pupil.' Then those twelve myriads of Magadha br&agrave;hma&otilde;as and householders understood: `Uruvel&agrave; Kassapa has placed himself under the spiritual direction of the Great Sama&otilde;a.'</FONT> </P>

And the Blessed One, who understood in His mind the reflection that had arisen in the minds of those twelve myriads of Magadha br&agrave;hma<I>&otilde;</I>as and householders, preached to them.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>9. Then the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra, having seen the Truth (&amp;c. down to) dependent on nobody else for the knowledge of the Teacher's Doctrine, said to the Blessed One: in former days, Lord, when I was a prince, I entertained five wishes; these are fulfilled now. In former days, Lord, when I was a prince, I wished: "O that I might be inaugurated as king." This was my first wish, Lord; this is fulfilled now.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>11. `Glorious, Lord! (&amp;c., as in chap.7. 10, down to:) who has taken his refuge in Him. And might the Blessed One, Lord, consent to take His meal with me tomorrow together with the fraternity of bhikkhus.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>The Blessed One expressed His consent by remaining silent.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>12.<B> </B>Then the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra, when he understood that the Blessed One had accepted his invitation, rose from his seat, respectfully saluted the Blessed One, and, passing round Him with his right side towards Him, went away. [\q 141/] and when the night had elapsed, the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra ordered excellent food, both hard and soft, to be prepared, and had dinner-time announced to the Blessed One in the words: `It is time, Lord, the meal is ready.' And in the forenoon the Blessed One, having put on His robes, took His alms-bowl, and with His civara on entered the city of R&agrave;jagaha, aha accompanied by a great number of bhikkhus, by one Thousand bhikkhus who all had been Ja&ntilde;ilas before.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>13.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>15<B>. </B>And the Blessed One went to the palace of the Magadha King Seniya Bimbis&agrave;ra. Having gone there, He sat down with the bhikkhus who followed Him.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>16.<B> </B>Sitting near Him the Magadha King Seniya, Bimbis&agrave;ra thought: `Where may I find a place for the Blessed One to live in, not too far from the town and not too near, suitable for going and coming, easily accessible for all people who want (to see Him), by day not too crowded, at night not exposed to much noise and alarm, clean of the smell of people, hidden from men, well fitted for a retired life</FONT> </P>

The Blessed One accepted the &agrave;r&agrave;ma (park). Then the Blessed One, after having taught, incited, animated, and gladdened the Magadha King Seniya [\q 144/] Bimbis&agrave;ra by religious discourse, rose from His seat and went away.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>And in consequence of this event the Blessed One, after having delivered a religious discourse, thus addressed the bhikkhus: `I allow you, O bhikkhus, to receive the donation of an &agrave;r&agrave;ma (a park).'</FONT> </P>

At that time S&agrave;riputta and Moggall&agrave;na (two young br&agrave;hma<I>&otilde;</I>as) led a religious life as followers of sa&agrave;jaya the paribb&agrave;jaka; these had given their word to each other: `He who first attains to the Immortal (amata, i.e. Nirv&agrave;na) shall tell the other one.'</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>2.<B> </B>Now one day the Venerable Assaji in the forenoon, having put on his robes, and having taken his alms-bowl, and with his civara on, entered the city of R&agrave;jagaha for alms; his walking, turning back, regarding, looking, drawing (his arms) back, and stretching (them) out was decorous; he turned his eyes to the ground, and was dignified in deportment. Now the paribb&agrave;jaka S&agrave;riputta saw the Venerable Assaji , who went through R&agrave;jagaha for alms, whose walking, &amp;c. was decorous, who kept his eyes on the ground, and was dignified in deportment.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`It is true, Lord.'</FONT> </P>

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>6.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`Things go pretty well with us Lord; we get [\q 176/] enough, Lord, to support our life, and we have made our journey, Lord, with not too great fatigue.' The Tath&agrave;gatas sometimes ask about what they know; sometimes they do not ask about what they know. They understand the right time when to ask and they understand the right time when not to ask. The Tath&agrave;gatas put questions full of sense, not void of sense; to what is void of sense the bridge is pulled down for the Tath&agrave;gatas. For two purposes the Blessed Buddhas put questions to the bhikkhus, when they intend to preach the Doctrine or when they intend to institute a rule of conduct to their disciples.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>5. And the blessed One said to the Venerable Upananda Va&iuml;gantaputta: `How many year have you completed, O bhikkhu, since your upasampad&agrave;?</FONT> </P>

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>Then the Blessed Buddha rebuked him: `This is improper, O foolish one, unbecoming, unsuitable, unworthy of a sama&otilde;a, unallowable, and to be avoided. How can you, O foolish one, who ought to receive exhortation and instruction from others, think yourself fit for administering exhortation and instruction to another bhikkhu? Too quickly O foolish one, have you abandoned yourself to the ambition of collecting followers. This will not do (&amp;c., as in chap.30.3).

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>Thus these persons went to the bhikkhus and asked them for the pabbajj&agrave; ordination; the bhikkhus conferred on them the pabbajj&agrave; and upasampad&agrave; ordinations; and the bhikkhus nursed them, and J&atilde;vaka Kom&agrave;rabhacca cured them.</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>3.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>1. Translated by I. B. Horner as `monk', <I>Book of the Discipline</I>, Vol. IV, p. vi</FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P><A NAME="N_2_"></A>2. To this book is prefixed, as<B> </B>introduction, an account of the first events after Gotama's attaining<B> </B>Buddhahood, down to the conversion of his two chief disciples, S&agrave;riputta and Moggall&agrave;na (chaps. 1-24). Among the elements of historical or legendary character with which, in the Vinaya Pi<I>&ntilde;</I>aka, the discussion of the monastic discipline is interwoven, this account occupies by far the first place, both in extent and in importance. For it contains the oldest version accessible to us now and, most probably, forever, of what the Buddhist fraternity deemed to be the history of their master's life in its most important period. </P>
<P>The connection in which this legendary narration stands with the main subject of the first Khandhaka is not difficult to account for. The regulations regarding the admission to the fraternity, which are discussed in this Khandhaka, could not but present themselves to the redactors of the Pi&ntilde;aka as being the very basis of their religious discipline and monastic life. It was possible to fancy the existence of the Sa&iuml;gha without the P&agrave;timokkha rules, or without the regulations about the pav&agrave;ran&agrave; festival, but it was impossible to realise the idea of a sa&iuml;gha without rules showing who was to be regarded as a duly admitted member of the fraternity, and who was not. It is quite natural, therefore, that the stories or legends concerning, the ordination of bhikkhus were put in connection with the record of the very first events of the history of the Sa&iuml;gha. </P>
<P>Nor is it difficult to account for the theory formulated by the historians of the Buddhist ecclesiastical law, of different successive forms in which the ordination of bhikkhus had been performed. In the beginning, of course, there was nobody but the Buddha himself who could ordain bhikkhus; to him those who desired to be received, expressed. Their wish, and he conferred on them the pabbajj&agrave; and upasampad&agrave; ordinations by the formula: ` ehi bhikkhu,' &amp;c.(see i,6,32,34,&amp;c.) It was a very natural conception that afterwards, as the sa&iuml;gha grew larger, the Buddha should have transferred the power of admitting new members to the bhikkhus themselves, and should have instituted that form of ordination which the redactors of the Pi&ntilde;aka found valid at their own time. </P>
<P>The transition, however, from the supposed oldest form of ordination (the so-called ehi-bhikkhu-upasampad&agrave;) to that latter form is in the Vinaya legends not represented as immediate. There is described an intermediate stage between the two, the ordination by the three saranagamanas, or by the candidate's three times repeated declaration of his taking refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sa&iuml;gha (see Mah&agrave;vagga I, 12). The reason which has led the redactors of the Vinaya Pi&ntilde;aka to this construction, was most probably the important part which in the upasampad&agrave; service of the later time devolved upon the preceptor (upajjh&agrave;ya) of the candidate. As only learned bhikkhus, who had completed the tenth year after their own upasampad&agrave;, could perform the function of upajjh&agrave;ya at the upasampad&agrave; ordination of other bhikkhus (Mah&agrave;vagga 1, 31, 8), it was natural that the redactors of the Vinaya found it impossible to ascribe this form of upasampad&agrave; service to the first times of Buddha's teaching. For these times, therefore, they recorded another form, the upasampad&agrave; by the three saranagamanas, the introduction of which they assigned, very naturally, to the time soon after the conversion of Yasa's friends, by which event the number of bhikkhus had been augmented at once from seven to sixty-one. </P>

The Mah&agrave;vagga, which contains these legends in their oldest forms, assigns to this stay a period of four times seven days; the later tradition is unanimous in extending it to seven times seven days (Buddhaghosa in the commentary on the Mah&agrave;vagga; J&agrave;taka Atthav. vol.i. p.77 seq.; D&atilde;pava&uuml;sa I, 29, 30; Lalita Vistara, p. 488 seq.; Beal, Romantic Legend, p. 236 seq., &amp;c.) </P>
<P><A NAME="N_5_"></A>5. The chain of causation, or the doctrine of the twelve nid&agrave;nas (causes of existence), contains, as has often been observed, in a more developed form an answer to the same problem to which the second and third of the four noble Truths (ariyasacca) also try to give a solution, viz. The problem of the origin and destruction of suffering. The noble Truths simply reduce the origin of suffering to thirst, or desire (tanh&agrave;), in its threefold form, thirst for pleasure, thirst for existence, thirst for prosperity (see I, 6, 20). In the system of the twelve nid&agrave;nas thirst also has found its place among the causes of suffering, but it is not considered as the immediate cause. A concatenation of other categories is inserted between tanh&agrave; and its ultimate effect; and on the other hand, the investigation of causes is carried on further beyond tanh&agrave;. The question is here asked, what does tanh&agrave; come from? And thus the series of causes and effects is led back to avijj&agrave; (ignorance), as its deepest root. We may add that the redactors of the Pi&ntilde;akas, who of course could not but observe this parallelity between the second and third ariyasakkas and the system of the twelve nid&agrave;nas, go so far, in one instance (Anguttara Nik&agrave;ya, Tika-Nip&agrave;ta, fol. ke of the Phayre MS.), As to directly replace, in giving the text of the four ariyasakkas, the second and third of them by the twelve nid&agrave;nas, in direct and reverse order respectively. Professor Childers has furnished a valuable note on the nid&agrave;nas; see Colebrooke, miscellaneous essays (second edition), ii, 453 seq. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_6_"></A>6. In the Samm&agrave;ditthisuttanta (Majjhima-Nik&agrave;ya, fol. kh&aring; of Turnour's MS.) We find the following explanation of what ignorance is: ` not to know suffering, not to know the cause of suffering, not to know the cessation of suffering, not to know the path which leads to the cessation of suffering, this is called ignorance.' the same is repeated in the explanation or the nid&agrave;na formula, which is given in the Vibha&iuml;ga (Abhidhamma Pi&ntilde;aka, Paticcasamuppadavibha&iuml;ga fol. ki of the Phayre MS.), And we must accept it, therefore, as the authentic expression of Buddhistical belief. It is obvious, however, that this explanation leaves room for another question. Ignorance, we are told, is the source of all evil and of all suffering, and the subject ignored is stated to be the four Truths. But who is the subject that ignores them? All attributes (as the vi&amp;curren;&amp;curren;&agrave;na, &amp;c.), That constitute sentient beings and enable them to know or to ignore, are said to be first produced by ignorance, and we should conclude, therefore, that they cannot exist before ignorance has begun to act. Or are we to understand that it is the ignorance incurred by a sentient being in a preceding existence, that causes the sa&iuml;kharas and consciousness, the connecting links between the different existences, to act and to bring about the birth of a new being? </P>
<P>As is well-known, this ignorance (avijj&agrave;) plays a great part also in the Brahmanical philosophy of the Upanishads; and the Buddhist belief is, no doubt, founded to a considerable extent on older theories. But we cannot venture in a note to touch upon one of the most difficult and interesting questions which await the research of Indianists. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_7_"></A>7. It is very frequently stated that there are three sa&iuml;kharas or productions: k&agrave;yasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra, vac&atilde;sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra, and cittasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra, or, productions of body, of speech, and of thought (see, for instance, the Samm&agrave;ditthisuttanta, Majjhima Nik&agrave;ya, fol. kh&aring; of Turnour's MS.) The k&agrave;yasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra consists, according to the Sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra Yamaka (Abhidhamma Pi&ntilde;aka), in inhalation and expiration (ass&agrave;sapass&agrave;s&agrave;); the vac&atilde;sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra in attention and investigation (vitakkavic&agrave;r&agrave;); the cittasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra in ideas, sensations, and all attributes of mind except attention and investigation (sa&amp;curren;&amp;curren;&agrave; ca vedan&agrave; ca thapetv&agrave; vitakkavik&agrave;re sabbe pi cittasampayuttak&agrave; dhamm&agrave;). The Vibha&iuml;ga (Abhidhamma Pi&ntilde;aka, Paticcasamuppadavibha&iuml;ga, 1.1.) Gives, when discussing the sa&iuml;kharas, six categories instead of the three: ` now which are the sa&iuml;kharas that are produced by ignorance? Sa&iuml;kharas (or, productions) that lead to righteousness, sa&iuml;kharas that lead to sinfulness, sa&iuml;kharas that lead to immovability, productions of body, of speech, and of thought.' the P&agrave;li words are: `Tattha katame avijj&agrave; paccay&agrave; sa&iuml;kh&agrave;r&agrave;? Pu&amp;curren;&amp;curren;&agrave;bhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;ro apu&amp;curren;&amp;curren;&agrave;bhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;ro &agrave;&otilde;a&amp;curren;g&agrave;bhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;ro k&agrave;yasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ro vac&atilde;sa&iuml;kharo cittasa&iuml;kh&agrave;ro.' the list of fifty-five categories belonging to the sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra khandha, which sp. Hardy gives in his Manual (p. 404 seq.; Comp. Also Rh. D., `Buddhism,' p. 91 seq., And `Buddhist suttas from the P&agrave;li,' p. 242), is not founded, as far as we know, on the authority of the Pi&ntilde;akas themselves, but on later compendia and commentaries. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_8_"></A>8. I.e. eye, ear, nose, tongue, body(or the faculty of touch) and mind. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_9_"></A>9. Buddhaghosa: `The goat-herds used to go to theshadow of that Banyan tree and tosit there; therefore it was calledthe Banyan tree of the goat-herds.' the northern Buddhists say that this tree had been planted by a shepherd boy, during the Bodhisatta`s six years' penance, in order to shelter him; see Beal, Rom. Legend, pp. 192, 238, and the Mah&agrave;vastu. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_10_"></A>10. `Huhu&iuml;kaj&agrave;tiko.' Buddhaghosa: `Because he was di&ntilde;&ntilde;hama&iuml;galika, he becamefilled with haughtiness and wrath, and went about uttering the sound "Huhu&uuml;."' Di&ntilde;&ntilde;hama&iuml;galika (having seen something auspicious?) is obscure to us. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_11_"></A>11 Buddhaghosa says that r&agrave;j&agrave;yatana (lit. A royal apartment) was the name of a tree. It is the same tree which in the Lalita Vistara (p. 493, ed. Calcutta) is called t&agrave;r&agrave;ya&otilde;a, and in the D&atilde;pava&uuml;sa (II, 50) kh&atilde;rap&agrave;la. The place where the two merchants met Buddha, is thus described in the Mah&agrave;vastu: ksh&atilde;rik&agrave;vanasha&otilde;&oacute;e bahudevatake cetiye. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_12_"></A>12. The term Tath&agrave;gata is, in the Buddhistical literature, exclusively applied to Samm&agrave;sambuddhas, and it is more especially used in the Pi&ntilde;akas when the Buddha is represented as speaking of himself in the third person as `The Tath&agrave;gata'. The meaning `Sentient being,' which is given to the word in the Abhidh&agrave;nappad&atilde;pik&agrave;, and in Childers's dictionary, is not confirmed, as far as we know, by any passage of the Pi&ntilde;akas. This translation of the word is very possibly based merely on a misunderstanding of the phrase often repeated in the Sutta Pi&ntilde;aka: hoti Tath&agrave;gata par M&agrave;ra, which means, of course, ` does a Buddha exist after death?' in the Jaina books we sometimes find the term tatthagaya (tatragata), `he who has attained that world, i.e. emancipation,' applied to the jinas as opposed to other beings who are called Inageya (idhagata), living in this world.' see, for instance, the Jinacaritra, #16. Considering the close relation in which most of the dogmatical terms of the Jainas stand to those of the Bauddhas, it is difficult to believe that Tath&agrave;gata and tatthagaya should not originally have conveyed very similar ideas. We think that on the long way from the original M&agrave;gadh&atilde; to the P&agrave;li and Sanskrit, the term tatthagata or tatth&agrave;gata (tatra+agata), `He who has arrived there, i.e. At emancipation,' may very easily have undergone the change into Tath&agrave;gata, which would have made it unintelligible, were we not able to compare its unaltered form as preserved by the Jainas. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_13_"></A>13. The four guardian gods of the quarters of the world; see Hardy's Manual, p. 24. Their P&agrave;li names, as given in the Abhidh&agrave;nappad&atilde;pik&agrave;, vv. 31, 32. The D&atilde;pava&uuml;sa XVI, 12, &amp;c., were, Dhatara&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, Vir&aring;l&thorn;aka, Vir&aring;pakkha, and Vessava&otilde;a or Kuvera. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_14_"></A>14. Onitapattap&agrave;ni, which is said very frequently of a person who has finished his meal, is translated by Childers, ` whose hand is removed from the bowl' (comp. Also Trenckner, P&agrave;li miscellany, p. 66). We do not think this explanation right, though it agrees with, or probably is based on, a note of Buddhaghosa ('pattato ca apan&atilde;tap&agrave;&otilde;i&uuml;'). Onita, i.e. avan&atilde;ta, is not apan&atilde;ta, and the end of the dinner was marked, not by the bhikkhu's removing his hand from the bowl, but by his washing the bowl (see Cullavagga VIII, 4,. 6), and, of course, his hands. In Sanskrit the, meaning of ava-n&atilde; is, to pour (water) upon something; see the Petersburg dictionary. We have translated, therefore, on&atilde;tapattap&agrave;&otilde;i accordingly. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_15_"></A>15. Because there was no Sa&iuml;gha at that time, their declaration of taking refuge, by which they became up&agrave;sakas, could refer only to the dyad (the Buddha and the Dhamma), instead of to the of the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sa&iuml;gha. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_16_"></A>16. The upadhis (substrata of existence) are specified in the commentary on the Sutta-Nip&agrave;ta, ap. Dhammapada, p. 433; `Sabb&aring;padhina&uuml; parikkhay&agrave;'ti sabbesa&uuml; khandhak&agrave;magu&otilde;akiles&agrave;bhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;rabhed&agrave;na&uuml; upadhina&uuml; parikkhi&otilde;att&agrave;`. Probably abhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra is not co-ordinate with the other members of the compound, but is determined by them, comp. pabbajj&agrave;bhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra, iddh&agrave;bhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra, gamik&agrave;bhisa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra. The upadhis, therefore, according to this passage, consist: firstly, in the actions of mind that are directed towards the khandhas (i.e. That have the effect of propagating. And augmenting the dominion of the khandhas); secondly, in the actions tending to the fivefold pleasures of sense ; and thirdly, in those connected with kilesa (evil passion). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_17_"></A>17. Buddhaghosa explains anacchariya by anuacchariya which is alike unintelligible to us. The Lalita Vistara (p.515,ed.Calcutta) has abh&atilde;ksh&otilde;am ('repeatedly'). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_18_"></A>18. It is difficult to believe that the P&agrave;li name of Brahma Sahampati, the ruler of the Brahma worlds (see Spence Hardy's Manual, pp. 43, 56), is not connected with the Brahman svayambh&aring; of the Brahmanical literature. Perhaps the Sanskrit equivalent of sahampati might be svayampati. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_27_"></A>27. Buddhaghosa, in a note on Cullavagga ii, 1, 1, says that p&agrave;dap&atilde;&ntilde;&thorn;a is a stool to put the washed foot on, p&agrave;dakathalika (or p&agrave;dakathalik&agrave;?), a stool to put the unwashed foot on, or a cloth to rub the feet with (p&agrave;dagha&uuml;sana). </P>

Feer's Etudes Bouddhiques, 1, p. 189 seq., And Rh. D., `Buddhist suttas from the P&agrave;li,' pp. 137-i55, and in the fortnightly review for December 1879. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_30_"></A>30. Clinging to the five elements of existence, rupa, vedan&agrave;, sanna, sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra, vi&amp;curren;&amp;curren;&agrave;na. See 38 seq. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_33_"></A>33. The thirty-three devas of the Vedic mythology.

<P><A NAME="N_34_"></A>34. Those three bhikkhus of the five, who had been converted went about for alms; while the Buddha remained with their two companions, and instructed them. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_35_"></A>35. This is shown exactly in the same way and with the same words that are used in sect. 38 with regard to the body. Body, sensations, perceptions, sa&iuml;kharas, and consciousness are the well-known five classes (khandha) of bodily and mental parts and powers; see Rh. D., `Buddhism,' p. Go seq. The self (att&agrave;), which, if it exists at all, must be permanent and imperishable, is not to be found in any one of these five classes, which are all subject to origin and decay. This discourse of the Buddha's, which is frequently called the Anattalakkha&otilde;a Sutta (sutta of the not having the signs of self, shows the perishable nature of the five khandhas, and that the khandhas are not the self. But it does not deal with the question, whether the self exists or not, in any other way. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_36_"></A>36. See the note on chap. 1. 2. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_37_"></A>37. This is shown exactly in the same way and with the same words that are used in sect. 38 with regard to the body. Body, sensations, perceptions, sa&iuml;kharas, and consciousness are the well-known five classes (khandha) of bodily and mental parts and powers; see Rh. D., `Buddhism,' p. Go seq. The self (att&agrave;), which, if it exists at all, must be permanent and imperishable, is not to be found in any one of these five classes, which are all subject to origin and decay. This discourse of the Buddha's, which is frequently called the Anattalakkha&otilde;a sutta (sutta of the not having the signs of self, shows the perishable nature of the five khandhas, and that the khandhas are not the self.

<P><A NAME="N_41_"></A>41. See the note on sect.9. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_42_"></A>42. A well-known scene in the life of the Bodhisatta has evidently been represented after the model of this story. See J&agrave;taka I, p. 61; Lalita Vistara, p. 251; Bigandet Life of Gaudama, p. 55. Nowhere in the P&agrave;li Pi&ntilde;akas is the story told about the Bodhisatta himself. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_43_"></A>43. This was a position of honour among the merchants. In the later literature we hear of an office of se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i (se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i-&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;ana) in a city, to which any one with the requisite wealth and talent was eligible (J&agrave;taka I, 120-122); and, according to the Mah&agrave;va&uuml;sa, the king appointed to an office called se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;ita, apparently at his court(Mah.p.69). The gahapati, or treasurer, one of the seven jewels of a king, is explained by Buddhaghosa to be se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;igahapati (see Rh. D.'s note on Mah&agrave;sudassana Sutta I, 41). `The se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i,' standing alone, or `the mah&agrave;-se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i,' means An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika (J&agrave;taka I, 95, 227-230; Dhammapada commentary, p. 395). Below, in chapter 9, sect. x, it would seem that the rank of se&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;i was hereditary, and this is confirmed by the later literature; but this applies to the social rank only, and not to the office. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_44_"></A>44. Pleasures of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and touch. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_46_"></A>46. Nekkhamma is neither naishkramya nor naishkarmya, but naishk&agrave;mya. Itivuttaka, fol. khi (Phayre MS.): k&agrave;m&agrave;na&uuml; eta&uuml; nissara&otilde;a&uuml; yad ida&uuml; nekkhamma&uuml;, r&aring;p&agrave;nam eta&uuml; nissara&otilde;a&uuml; yad ida&uuml; aruppa&uuml;. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_47_"></A>47. The stage of a sekha, i.e. a person who has attained to any stage in the noble eightfold path (such as sot&agrave;pattiphala, &amp;c.) inferior to the highest (arahatship). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_48_"></A>48. The rules about the dress of a bhikkhu who is going to the village are given in theCullavagga viii, 4, 3; 5, 2. Compare Rh. D.'s note on theMah&agrave;-parinibbana Sutta v,45. Vin. Texts, Rh.D. &amp; H.O. says her: `under-robes'. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_49_"></A>49. According to Subh&aring;ti (in Childers's dictionary) sampav&agrave;reti means that the host hands dishes to the guest until the latter says, I have had enough.' Childers accordingly translates sampav&agrave;reti, `To cause to refuse.' but as pav&agrave;reti means, `To cause to accept,' it is impossible that sampav&agrave;reti should have exactly the opposite meaning. We prefer, therefore, to take it as an emphatic synonym of pav&agrave;reti. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_50_"></A>50. This cannot be understood as a general rule, for it is repeated nowhere whereprecepts for wandering bhikkhus are given, and on the contrary, numerous instances occur in the sacred texts in which two or more bhikkhus are mentioned as wandering together, without any expression of disapproval being added. The precept given here evidently is intended to refer only to the earliest period in the spread of the new Doctrine; just as in chap. 12 a form of upasampad&agrave; is introduced by Buddha which was regarded as inadmissible in later times. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_51_"></A>51. The correct spelling of this name appears to be Sen&agrave;ninigama ('The general's town'), and not Sen&agrave;nigama (`the army's town'); the J&agrave;taka Atthava&otilde;&otilde;an&agrave; (vol. i. p. 68) and the Paris MS. Of the Mah&agrave;vagga (manu secunda) read Sen&agrave;ninigama. The Lalita Vistara has Sen&agrave;patigr&agrave;ma. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_54_"></A>54. The Ja&ntilde;ilas (i.e. ascetics wearing matted hair) are Brahmanical v&agrave;naprasthas. The description of their ascetic life given in many passages of the J&agrave;taka Atthava&otilde;&otilde;an&agrave; and of the Apad&agrave;na exactly agrees with the picture of the forest life of the which so frequently occurs in the Mah&agrave;bh&agrave;rata. In the Mah&agrave;vagga (vi, 35, 2) it is expressly stated that the Ja&ntilde;ilas recognised the authority of the veda, and it is in keeping with this that the usual term for adopting the state of a Ja&ntilde;ila is isipabbajjam pabbajati' (frequently in the J&agrave;t. Atth.), i.e. leaving the world and becoming a &ccedil;ishi. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_55_"></A>55. Iddhi. Compare the passages referred to by Rh. D. in ` Buddhist suttas from the P&agrave;li,' pp. 2, 40, 259; and further Mah&agrave;vagga VI, 15, 8, and Cullavagga VII, I p.4, and VII, 2, 1. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_60_"></A>60. In sects. 6, 7 (excepting the last clause of sect. 7) the story related, in 1-5 is repeated in a more popular style. This appears to us to be a more archaic redaction than the preceding. We do not know any other instance in the P&agrave;li Pi&ntilde;akas of a similar repetition, excepting a short passage at the end of chap. 24. 3; and one other in the Mah&agrave;padh&agrave;na sutta. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_61_"></A>61. Literally, ` the snake among, men,' or the elephant among men (manussan&agrave;go). </P>

<P><A NAME="N_67_"></A>67. Bigandet (Life of Gaudama, p. 135) translates this passage from the Burmese version: Gaudama split it in a moment, in five hundred pieces.' doubtless the true meaning is, that there were five hundred pieces of wood, one for each of the five hundred Ja&ntilde;ilas over whom was Kassapa chief. In the following two stories (sects. 13, 14) we have five hundred sacred fires. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_71_"></A>71. We are extremely doubtful about the meaning of kh&agrave;rik&agrave;ja, which Buddhaghosa explains by kh&agrave;ribhh&agrave;ra. Perhaps it may mean provisions of any description of which each Ja&ntilde;ila used to keep one kh&agrave;ri (a certain dry measure). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_72_"></A>72. This is evidently a remark added to the text by a reader or commentator. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_73_"></A>73. According to General Cunningham, Gay&agrave;sisa (`the head ofGay&agrave;') is the mountain of Brahm&agrave;yoni near Gay&agrave;. Arch. Rep.111, 07. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_74_"></A>74. Here the same exposition which has been given relating to the eye, its objects, the sensations produced by its contact with objects, &amp;c., Is repeated with reference to the ear and the other organs of sense. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_75_"></A>75. Lacchivana (Sank. yash&ntilde;ivana), literally, `stick forest,' means a forest consisting of bambus. General Cunningham has the following note about this bamboo forest: `In 1862, when I was at R&agrave;jgir (i.e. R&agrave;jagaha), I heard the bambu forest always spoken of as jaktiban; . . . I fixed the position of the bambu forest to the south-west of R&agrave;jgir on the hill lying between the hot-springs of Tapoban and old R&agrave;jag&ccedil;&atilde;ha.' Reports, III, 140. </P>
<P>The word we have rendered sacred shrine is cetiya. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_76_"></A>76. </P>
<P>&nbsp;The word householder (gahapat1) is used here, as is the case not infrequently, to denote householders of the third caste. Compare Rh. D.'s note on Mah&agrave;sudassana Sutta, p. 260. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_77_"></A>77. Literally, `who is known as emaciate.' this is said with reference to the mortifications practised by the Ja&ntilde;ilas or V&agrave;naprasthas. The Mah&agrave;bh&agrave;rata (ill, 1499) uses the same adjective (k&ccedil;&atilde;&ugrave;a) of a Ja&ntilde;ila. Vad&agrave;no we take for a participle, but it is possible also to read vad&agrave; no, `Tell us,' which professor Jacobi (Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morg. Ges., XXXIV, p. 187) prefers. Buddhaghosa takes kisakovad&agrave;no for a compound of kisaka and ovad&agrave;na : t&agrave;pas&agrave;na&uuml; ov&agrave;dako anus&agrave;sako. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_78_"></A>78. The meaning is: the mantras which are recited at the sacrifices contain praises of visible things, &amp;c., And the rewards that are promised to him who offers such sacrifices do not extend beyond that same sphere. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_79_"></A>79. The P&agrave;li word is upadhi, which is translated by Childers, `Substratum of being.' see our note on chap. 5. 2. In this passage upadhi is said to refer to the khandhas (Buddhaghosa). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_80_"></A>80. Here we have the Vedic distinction of greater and smaller sacrifices (yajatayas and juhotayas). The P&agrave;li word is upadhi, which is translated by Childers, `Substratum of being.' see our note on chap. 5. 2. In this passage upadhi is said to refer to the khandhas (Buddhaghosa). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_81_"></A>81. The words `said the Blessed One' (ti Bhagav&agrave; avoca) are probably interpolated from a gloss, as they destroy the metre. The P&agrave;li word is upadhi, which is translated by Childers, `Substratum of being.' see our note on chap. 5. 2. In this passage upadhi is said to refer to the khandhas (Buddhaghosa). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_82_"></A>82. Doubtless Buddhaghosa is right in explaining ko by kva. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_83_"></A>83. </P>
<P>&nbsp;The P&agrave;li word is upadhi, which is translated by Childers, `Substratum of being.' see our note on chap. 5.2. In this passage upadhi is said to refer to the khandhas (Buddhaghosa). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_84_"></A>84. Aki&amp;curren;cana here, and elsewhere, used as an epithet of arahatship, refers to the state of mind in which the ki&amp;curren;canas, that is, lust, malice, and delusion (so in the Sa&iuml;giti Sutta of the D&atilde;gha Nik&agrave;ya),have ceased to be. It is literally `being without the somethings,' which are the things that stand in the way, the obstacles to Buddhist perfection; and Buddhaghosa (in the Suma&iuml;gala Vil&agrave;sin&atilde; on the passage in the Sa&iuml;giti Sutta) explains accordingly ki&amp;curren;cana by pa&euml;ibodha. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_85_"></A>85. Gold colour is one (the 17th) of the thirty-two lakkha&otilde;a which form the characteristics of Buddha as a mah&agrave;purisa. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_86_"></A>86. The ten ariyav&agrave;sas. Buddhaghosa says: dasasu ariyav&agrave;sesu vutthav&agrave;so. The Sa&iuml;giti Sutta gives the ten noble states, as follows: 1. Being free from the five bad qualities (pa&iuml;ca&iuml;ga), 2. Being possessed of the six good qualities (chala&iuml;ga), 3. Being guarded in the one thing (ek&agrave;rakkha), 4. Observing four things (catur&agrave;passena), 5. Rejecting each of the four false Truths (panunna pacceka-sacca), 6. Seeking right things (samavayasa- dhesana),,7. Having pure aims (an&agrave;vila-sa&iuml;kappa), 8. Being full of ease (passaddhak&agrave;ya-sa&iuml;kh&agrave;ra), 9. Being emancipated in heart (suvimuttacitta), 10. Being emancipated in ideas (suvimuttapa&amp;curren;&amp;curren;a). The Sa&iuml;giti then further enlarges on the meaning of each of these ten. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_87_"></A>87. The ten balas, which are ten kinds of knowledge (&amp;curren;&agrave;&otilde;a); see Burnouf, Lotus, p. 781 and following, and compare J&agrave;taka I, 78. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_88_"></A>88. Buddhaghosa explains dasadhammavid&aring; by dasakammapathavid&aring;. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_89_"></A>89. Buddhaghosa explains dasabhi c'&aring;peto by supplying asekhehi dhammehi. The first eight of the ten asekh&agrave; dhamma consist in the full perfection of samm&agrave;ditthi (right belief and the other categories enumerated in the formula of the noble eightfold path; the ninth and tenth are the perfection of samm&agrave;&amp;curren;&agrave;na (right knowledge) and samm&agrave;vimutti (right emancipation). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_90_"></A>90. The site of the Veluvana (`bambu forest') near R&agrave;jagaha has not yet been discovered. `It must have occupied about the position where the ancient basements, marked K.K.K. And G. in Cunningham's map of R&agrave;jag&ccedil;&atilde;ha (pl. xiv, Reports, vol. i), were found by him' (Rh. D., `Buddhism,' p. 62 note). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_91_"></A>91. This seems to us the meaning of atthikehi upa&amp;curren;&amp;curren;&agrave;ta&uuml; magga&uuml;. S&agrave;riputta followed Assaji as suppliants are accustomed to follow their proposed benefactor till a convenient season arrives for preferring their request. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_92_"></A>92. The same words as are put in the mouth of Upaka, when addressing the Buddha, above, chap. 6, sect. 7 (and see below, sect. 6). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_93_"></A>93. This famous stanza doubtless alludes to the formula of the twelve nid&agrave;nas (see chap. 1. 2) which explains the origination and cessation of what are called here ` dhamm&agrave; hetuppabbav&agrave;.' Hetu and paccaya (the word so frequently used in the formula of the nid&agrave;nas) are nearly synonymous. Colebrooke (Life and Essays, vol. ii. p. 419) says that the Bauddhas distinguish between hetu, `proximate cause,' and paccaya (pratyaya), concurrent occasion;' but, in practical use, this slight difference of meaning, if it really existed, has but little weight attached to it. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_94_"></A>94. See sects. 2-4. Instead of `The paribb&agrave;jaka S&agrave;riputta,' of course, the pronoun of the first person is to be read; instead of `The Venerable Assaji' read, ` The bhikkhu Assaji;' and further, the vocative friend' (&agrave;vuso), addressed to Moggall&agrave;na, is inserted three or four times in the course of this narration. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_95_"></A>95. The later Burmese and Chinese works translated by Bigandet (Life of Gaudama, p. 152 and by Beal (Romantic Legend, p. 330) add that he died. This is not in the P&agrave;li text, and the Sinhalese account given by Hardy (Manual, p. 97) is directly opposed to that statement. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_96_"></A>96. Upatissa was called S&agrave;riputta after his mother ('The son of S&agrave;ri'); Kolita had the family name Moggall&agrave;na (compare Beal, Romantic Legend, pp. 324, 331). The name Upatissa occurs in Asoka's well-known edict which has been found at Barite. The king there quotes `The Question of Upatissa' among the texts, the study of which he recommends to the brethren and sisters of the fraternity and to the laymen of either sex. This very probably refers to the dialogue between Assaji and S&agrave;riputta. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_97_"></A>97. As to this repetition of what had been related before, comp. The note on chap. 15. 6, 7. The words from gambh&atilde;re down to upadhisa&iuml;khaye form a &ugrave;loka. This is one of several instances where an older passage in verse, and probably first composed in some nearly related dialect, appears in the P&agrave;li Pi&ntilde;akas in prose. It is this which explains the extraordinary grammatical construction of the first seven words. Compare Rh. D.'s note on the similar instance at Mah&agrave;parinibb&agrave;na sutta V, 62. The exclamation put into the mouth of S&agrave;riputta, and afterwards of Moggall&agrave;na (above, chap. 23, sects. 5, 10), ought also, perhaps, to be included in the same category. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_98_"></A>98. The chief object of the first book being to discuss the regulations for the upasampad&agrave; ordination, at which the preceptor (upajjh&agrave;ya) of the candidate has a principal part, the text now goes on to relate the institution of the office and upajjh&agrave;yas, and to explain the mutual duties incumbent on upajjh&agrave;yas and pupils (saddhivih&agrave;rikas). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_99_"></A>99. Buddhaghosa has the following note on utti&ntilde;&ntilde;hapatta: `utti&ntilde;&ntilde;hapatta ti pi&otilde;&oacute;&agrave;ya cara&otilde;akapatta&uuml;, tasmi&uuml; hi manuss&agrave; ucci&ntilde;&ntilde;hasa&amp;curren;&amp;curren;ino (this word is spelt so in the Paris MS. As well as in the Berlin MS. of the Samanta P&agrave;s&agrave;dik&agrave;; the usual spelling is ucchi&ntilde;&ntilde;ha), tasm&agrave; utti&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;apattan ti vutta&uuml;. athav&agrave; u&ntilde;&ntilde;hahitv&agrave; patta&uuml; upan&agrave;mentiti evam ettha attho da&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;abbo.' we take the word, as the former of Buddhaghosa's two explanations implies, for a composition of ucchi&ntilde;&ntilde;ha. For the conversion of palatal consonants into dentals, see e. Kuhn, Beitrage zur P&agrave;li-Grammatik, p. 36, and on the use of the word compare Trenckner's Milinda Pa&amp;curren;ho, pp. 213, 214. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_103_"></A>103. According to Buddhaghosa the meaning of these words is: if the alms-bowl of the upajjh&agrave;ya has become too heavy or hot by the food put into it, the saddhivih&agrave;rika ought to take it and give his own bowl to the upajjh&agrave;ya. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_104_"></A>104. See chap. 6.11, with the note. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_106_"></A>106. The P&agrave;li text is: `Obhoge k&agrave;yabandhana&uuml; k&agrave;tabba&uuml;.' Buddhaghosa's note runs as follows: `K&agrave;yabandhana&uuml; sa&otilde;gharitv&agrave;(read sa&otilde;haritv&agrave;) civarabhoge pakkhipitv&agrave; &ntilde;&thorn;apetabba&uuml;.' we do not venture to offer any conjectures as to the meaning of this passage. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_119_"></A>119. Literally, make it (the discontentedness) clear. Buddhaghosa reads v&aring;pak&agrave;setabbo v&aring;pak&agrave;s&agrave;petabbo, which he explains thus: `v&aring;pak&agrave;setabbo means, ``Let (the saddhivih&agrave;rika) lead him to another place;" v&aring;pak&agrave;s&agrave;petabbo means, "Let him tell another bhikkhu to take the thera and go with him elsewhere."' </P>
<P><A NAME="N_120_"></A>120. The second and third books of the Cullavagga contain a detailed explanation of pariv&agrave;sa and of the other technical term contained in this paragraph. The term is by I. B. Horner translated as `probation', Book of the Discipline, Vol. IV, p. vi </P>

<P><A NAME="N_125_"></A>125. We believe that; the words the moderate bhikkhus' are, intended here and throughout the whole work as an abbreviation of the fuller phrase, `Those bhikkhus who were moderate frugal, modest, conscientious, anxious for training' (chap. 25. 3). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_126_"></A>126. All this is an abbreviation of what has been given at full length in chap. 2 5. 4-6. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_127_"></A>127. Those slight offences which were not embodied in the P&agrave;timokkha are called dukka&ntilde;a offences. They range, as to their gravity, with, the P&agrave;cittiya offences of the P&agrave;timokkha. For him who had committed a dukka&ntilde;a offence, no further penance was required than a simple confession of his fault. See Cullavagga XL. 1,10. Translated as `wrong-doing' by I. B. Horner, Book of the Discipline, Vol. IV, p. vi </P>
<P><A NAME="N_128_"></A>128. See chap. 12 and the note on chap. 1,1. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_129_"></A>129. The form for bringing a formal motion before the order is the following: the mover first announces to the assembled bhikkhus what resolution he is going to propose; this announcement is called &amp;curren;atti (see, for instance, sect. 4). After the &amp;curren;atti follows the question put to the bhikkhus present if they approve the resolution. This question is put either once or three times; in the first case we leave a &amp;curren;attidutiya kamma (see, for instance, ii chap. 6); in the second case, a &amp;curren;atticatuttha kamma:( as in this chapter). &amp;yen;atti is by I. B. Horner translated as `motion', Book of the Discipline, Vol. IV, p. vi </P>
<P><A NAME="N_130_"></A>130. With this and the following chapters should be compared the corresponding ordinance laid down in chapters 74-76. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_131_"></A>131. Here follows the complete formula of a &amp;curren;atticatuttha kamma, as in chap. 28. 4-6. The only difference is, that here in the &amp;curren;atti, as well as in the three questions, the words `N.N. asks the sa&iuml;gha for the upasampad&agrave; ordination with N.N. as upajjh&agrave;ya' are inserted after the words I desires to receive the upasampad&agrave; ordination from the Venerable N.N.' </P>
<P><A NAME="N_132_"></A>132. On this curious expression, compare Cullavagga IV, 4, 8. It is frequently repeated below. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_133_"></A>133. These are the five kinds of dwellings (pa&amp;curren;ca len&agrave;ni) which are declared to be allowable, Cullavagga VI, 1, 2. The single expressions are explained by Buddhaghosa in his note on Cullavagga 11 as follows: ` a&oacute;&oacute;&thorn;ayogo'ti suva&otilde;&otilde;ava&iuml;gageha&uuml;, p&agrave;s&agrave;do'ti d&atilde;ghap&agrave;s&agrave;do, hammiyan ti upari&agrave;k&agrave;satale pati&ntilde;&ntilde;&thorn;itak&aring;&ntilde;&agrave;g&agrave;ro p&agrave;s&agrave;do yeva, guh&agrave;'ti i&ntilde;&ntilde;hakaguh&agrave; sil&agrave;guh&agrave; d&agrave;ruguh&agrave; pa&uuml;suguh&agrave;' i.e. a&oacute;&oacute;&thorn;&agrave;yoga is a gold-coloured Bengal house. P&agrave;s&agrave;da is a long, storied mansion (or, the whole of an upper storey). Hammiya, is a p&agrave;s&agrave;da. Which has an upper chamber placed on the topmost storey. Guh&agrave; is a hut made of brick or in a rock, or of wood.' </P>
<P><A NAME="N_134_"></A>134. Compare Mah&agrave;vagga vi, 14, 6. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_135_"></A>135. This story recurs in the J&agrave;taka commentary 11, 449. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_137_"></A>137. See the conclusion of this in chapter 38. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_138_"></A>138. Buddhaghosa can scarcely be right in explaining pakkhasa&iuml;kanta by titthiyapakkhasa&iuml;kanta. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_139_"></A>139. &acirc;cariya as well as upajjh&agrave;ya means `Teacher,' or preceptor.' it is very difficult or rather impossible to draw a sharp line of distinction between &agrave;cariya and upajjh&agrave;ya. The duties of an &agrave;cariya towards his antev&agrave;sika, and of an antev&agrave;sika towards his &agrave;cariya, as indicated in chaps. 32, 33 (Cullavagga VIII, 13, 14), are exactly the same as those of an upajjh&agrave;ya towards his saddhivih&agrave;rika and vice versa (chaps. 25, 26 Cullavagga VIII, 11, 1 2). The position of an upajjh&agrave;ya however was considered as the more important of the two; at the upasampad&agrave; service the upajjh&agrave;ya had a more prominent part than the &agrave;cariya, as we may infer from chaps. 28, 29, and from the explanations on the 65th p&agrave;cittiya rule which are given in the Sutta Vibha&iuml;ga. There it is said that, if the upasampad&agrave; ordination had been conferred, against the rule, on a person that has not yet attained his twentieth year, the upajjh&agrave;ya has made himself guilty of a p&agrave;cittiya offence, the &agrave;cariya and the other present bhikkhus only of a dukka&ntilde;a offence. We may add that the succession of Vinaya teachers from Up&agrave;li down to Mahinda, which is given in the D&atilde;pava&uuml;sa (Bh&agrave;nav&agrave;ra iv and v), is a succession of upajjh&agrave;yas and saddhivih&agrave;rikas (see iv, 36, 42, 43, &amp;c.), Not of &agrave;cariyas and antev&agrave;sikas; the duty of instructing the young bhikkhus in the holy doctrines and ordinances seems, therefore, to belong to the upajjh&agrave;ya rather than to the &agrave;cariya; compare also D&atilde;pava&uuml;sa vii, 26. So among the br&agrave;hma&otilde;as, on the contrary, the &agrave;cariya is estimated higher than the upajjh&agrave;ya; see Manu II, 145; Y&agrave;j&amp;curren;avalkya I, 35. Compare also chap. 36,1 (end of the paragraph), and Buddhaghosa's explanation of that passage. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_140_"></A>140. Nissaya (i.e. dependence) is the relation between &agrave;cariya and antev&agrave;sika. The antev&agrave;sika lives `niss&agrave;ya' with regard to the &agrave;cariya, i.e. dependent on him; the &agrave;cariya gives his nissaya to the antev&agrave;sika, i.e. he receives him into his protection and care. At chap. 36. 1, `Nissaya' is said also of the relation between upajjh&agrave;ya and saddhivih&agrave;rika. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_141_"></A>141. That is, ` did not know how to decide whether their nissaya was destroyed, or not.' </P>
<P><A NAME="N_142_"></A>142. This refers, according to Buddhaghosa, to the pa&otilde;&agrave;man&agrave; (turning away of the saddhivih&agrave;rika); see chap. 27. 2. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_143_"></A>143. Buddhaghosa: `Coming together maybe understood either by seeing or by hearing. If a saddhivih&agrave;rika who lives in dependence (niss&agrave;ya) on his &agrave;cariya sees his upajjh&agrave;ya paying homage to a sacred shrine in the same vih&agrave;ra, or going on his rounds in the same village, cessation of the nissaya (towards the &agrave;cariya) is the consequence. If he hears the voice of his upajjh&agrave;ya, who preaches the Dhamma or gladdens (lay-people by religious discourse), in the vih&agrave;ra or in the interior of a house, and if he recognises that it is his upajjh&agrave;ya's voice, cessation of the nissaya (towards the &agrave;cariya) is the consequence.' </P>
<P><A NAME="N_144_"></A>144. </P>
<P>&nbsp;About the ordination of novices, see chap. 54. 3. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_145_"></A>145. According to Buddhaghosa, moral transgression (adhis&atilde;la) is said with regard to offences against the p&agrave;r&agrave;jika and sa&iuml;gh&agrave;disesa rules, while transgressions in conduct(ajjh&agrave;c&agrave;ra) consist in offences against the minor rules of the P&agrave;timokkha. Buddhaghosa's explanation is confirmed by the Mah&agrave;vagga iv, 16, 12. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_146_"></A>146. According to Buddhaghosa, this refers to instruction in the khandhakavatta (i.e. in the rules contained in the Khandhaka texts, Mah&agrave;vagga and Cullavagga?). See also Spence Hardy, Manual, p. 492. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_147_"></A>147. This means instructing him in the sekhapa&amp;curren;&amp;curren;atti (Buddhaghosa). We cannot say what is the accurate meaning of the last term, which apparently, as its verbal meaning seems to imply, refers to ordinances for those bhikkhus who have entered the path of sanctification, but have not yet attained arahatship. Spence Hardy (Manual, p. 493) gives the term sekha-s&atilde;la, which he explains as the observance of precepts in order to become a sekha. See also Hardy's note on &agrave;dibrahmacariya-sila, 1.1.p.492. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_148_"></A>148. Chap. 37 is exactly identical with chap. 36. 2-15, but for the sixth case, which, throughout chap. 37, is added each time at the end of the five cases given in chap. 36, when he has not completed the tenth year (after his upasampad&agrave;);' and respectively, `when he has completed ten years or more than ten years (after his upasampad&agrave;).' </P>
<P><A NAME="N_149_"></A>149. It should be, `fourteen times.' </P>

<P><A NAME="N_153_"></A>153. J&atilde;vaka was physician to King Bimbis&agrave;ra and one of the chief partisans of Buddha at the court of R&agrave;jagaha. See viii, 1, the introduction of the S&agrave;ma&amp;curren;&amp;curren;aphala Sutta, &amp;c. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_154_"></A>154. On uccinatha, compare the use of ucchecch&agrave;mi at Mah&agrave;parinibb&agrave;na Sutta I, 1 (p. 1), which Buddhaghosa rightly explains by ucchindiss&agrave;mi. But we think it better to adhere here to the reading uccinatha, in accordance with the MSS. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_155_"></A>155. The robber A&iuml;gulim&agrave;la (i.e. he who wears a necklace of fingers), whose original name was Ahi&uuml;saka, had received this surname from his habit of cutting of the fingers of his victims and wearing them as a necklace. See Spence Hardy, Manual. 249 seq. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_156_"></A>156. Buddhaghosa explains kamm&agrave;rabha&otilde;&oacute;u by tul&agrave;taramu&otilde;&oacute;ako (read tul&agrave;dh&agrave;ram.) suva&otilde;&otilde;ak&agrave;raputto. At Dhammapada, v. 239, Kmart is said of a silversmith. There was probably no distinction in these early times between gold, silver, copper, and iron smiths;, the same man being an artificer in all kinds of metal. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_157_"></A>157. This Up&agrave;li is different from the famous Up&agrave;li who belonged to the chief disciples of Buddha; the latter came not from R&agrave;jagaha, but from the Sakya country. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_158_"></A>158. Buddhaghosa: ` he who learns arithmetic, must think much; therefore his breast will become diseased.' </P>
<P><A NAME="N_159_"></A>159. We prefer this translation of r&aring;pa to translating it by ` painting,' on account of Buddhaghosa's note : ` he who learns the r&aring;pa-sutta must turn over and over many k&agrave;rsh&agrave;pa&otilde;as and look at them.' </P>
<P><A NAME="N_160_"></A>160. The law alluded to is the 65th p&agrave;cittiya rule. Generally in the khandhakas which presuppose as we have stated in our preface, the existence of the P&agrave;timokkha, direct repetition of the rules laid down there has been avoided. If nevertheless, in the khandhakas a transgression alluded to in the P&agrave;timokkha had to be mentioned again, then in most cases the khandhakas, instead of directly indicating the penance incurred thereby, use of the guilty bhikkhu the expression, `yath&agrave;dhammo k&agrave;retabbo,' i.e. he is to be treated according to the law.' see h 0.'s introduction to his edition of the Mah&agrave;vagga, p. XX note. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_161_"></A>161. Buddhaghosa explains ahiv&agrave;takaroga by m&agrave;riby&agrave;dhi, and says: `When this plague befalls a house, men and beasts in that house die ; but he who breaks through wall or roof, or is `` rog&agrave; m&agrave;digato(?)," May be saved.' </P>
<P><A NAME="N_162_"></A>162. This seems very unpractical and the rule is accordingly practically abrogated again by chapter 55. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_163_"></A>163. We must leave `&agrave;hundarik&agrave;' untranslated; Buddhaghosa says nothing about this obscure word. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_164_"></A>164. See chap. 32. 1. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_165_"></A>165. Supply these pentads and hexads, respectively, from chaps. 36. 6, 7; 8, 9; 14, 15 ; 16, 17; 37. 1, 2; 5, 6; 7, 8; 13, 14. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_166_"></A>166. Abhay&aring;vara means, `secure from anything.' this refers to the expression used in chap. 42, sect. 2. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_167_"></A>167. The Buddha's former wife. This is, as far as we know, the only passage in the P&agrave;li Pi&ntilde;akas which mentions this lady, and it deserves notice that her name is not mentioned. Probably this name was unknown to the Buddhists in early times, and thus we may best account for the difference of the simply invented names given to this lady by later writers. Compare Rh. D. Buddhism, p. 5o seq. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_168_"></A>168. Granting a boon is a constant phrase used of princes when making an open promise to give to any one whatever they sh</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+" SIZE=2>ould ask. See, for instance, the J&agrave;taka story, no. 9, where the person to whom the boon was given laid it by for a convenient season; and then asked the king to make her son heir-apparent, in violation of all ancient law and custom.</B></FONT> </P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P><A NAME="N_169_"></A>169. Nanda was a son of Mah&agrave;pajapati, a half-brother of the Buddha. See the story of his conversion in Rh. D.'s Buddhist Birth Stories, p. 128 (later and fuller accounts can be seen in Hardy, Manual, p. 204 seq.; Beal, Romantic Legend, p. 369 seq.) </P>
<P><A NAME="N_170_"></A>170. See chap. 52. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_171_"></A>171. Sikkh&agrave;pad&agrave;ni, literally, ` paths of training.' compare chap. 60. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_172_"></A>172. Here first appear the chabbaggiy&agrave; bhikkhus (the company of the six bhikkhus', with their attendants), the constant and indefatigable evil-doers throughout the whole Vinaya-Pi&ntilde;aka. Buddhaghosa (on Cullavagga I, 1) says that Pa&otilde;&oacute;uka and Lohitaka belonged to this company, and also Assaji and Punabbasu are mentioned as chabbaggiyas (see Childers s. V. chabbaggiy&agrave;). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_173_"></A>173. The case of the novice's committing sexual intercourse with a bhikkhuni can have found its place here only by a negligence of the redactor, as it is comprised already in the third of the ten cases (the novice's committing impurity). Buddhaghosa (who of course never admits anything like an inadvertence of the holy theras by whom the Vinaya is compiled) says that the third case and the tenth are distinguished here, because a person that has simply committed an impurity may receive the ordination, if he is willing to refrain himself in future; whilst a bhikkhun&atilde;d&aring;saka cannot be ordained in any case (see chap. 67). </P>
<P><A NAME="N_174_"></A>174.

<P><A NAME="N_177_"></A>177. Buddhaghosa (Berlin MS.) Explains chinniriy&agrave;patha' by pidhasappi.' we ought to read, no doubt pi&ntilde;&thorn;asapp&atilde;, which is Sanskrit p&atilde;thasarpin, a cripple who is in a wheel-chair. </P>

<P><A NAME="N_180_"></A>180. With these sections compare the previous chapters 12, 28 and following, 36 and following. The &amp;curren;attis prescribed in this chapter, together with the Three Refuges formula prescribed in chap. 12, sect. 4,the whole of chapter 77, and the four interdictions form together the current ceremony of ordination (the upasampad&agrave;-kamma-v&agrave;c&agrave;) as now still in use in the order. , see the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, New Series, VII, p. 1. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_181_"></A>181. I.e. according to Buddhaghosa, repeat to him all the data specified before together, in order that he might be able to give a correct answer when asked about his spiritual age. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_182_"></A>182. The vimokkhas (literally, deliverances) are eight stages of meditation different from the four jh&agrave;nas. The characteristics of the different vimokkhas are specified by Childers s.v. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_183_"></A>183. This temporary expulsion (ukkhepaniyakamma) which is pronounced against bhikkhus who refuse to see an offence committed by them selves (&agrave;pattiy&agrave; adassane), or to atone for such an offence (&agrave;pattiy&agrave; appa&ntilde;ikamme), or to renounce a false doctrine (p&agrave;pik&agrave;ya di&ntilde;&ntilde;hiy&agrave; appa&ntilde;inissagge), must be distinguished from the definitive and permanent expulsion (n&agrave;san&agrave;) which is pronounced against bhikkhus who have committed a p&agrave;r&agrave;jika offence, or in cases like those treated of in chapters 61 seq. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_184_"></A>184. I.e. The sentence of expulsion is abolished; compare the Samanta P&agrave;s&agrave;dik&agrave;, ap. Minayeff, Pr&agrave;timoksha, p. 92. </P>
<P><A NAME="N_185_"></A>185. As in sects.1, 2. Instead of ` will you see that offence?' and, `I will see it,' read here: `will you atone for that offence?' And, `I will atone for it.' </P>
