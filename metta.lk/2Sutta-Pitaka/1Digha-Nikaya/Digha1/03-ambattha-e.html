TO THE<BR>
AMBA&ograve;&ograve;HA SUTTA</P>
</B><P>THIS is one of several Suttas (mentioned in the notes to the celebrated verse quoted at the end of Chapter I) which deal with the subject of caste.</P>
<P>It is sufficiently evident from the comparative frequency of the discussions on the matter of Brahman pretensions that this was a burning question at the time when the Dialogues were composed. No other social problem is referred to so often; and Brahman would not be so often represented as expressing astonishment or indignation at the position taken up regarding it by the early Buddhists unless there had really been a serious difference on the subject between the two schools. But the difference, though real, has been gravely misunderstood.</P>
<P>Some writers on Buddhism do not hesitate to ascribe to Gotama the role of a successful political reformer, by representing him as having fought for the poor and despised against the rich and privileged classes, and as having gone far to abolish caste. Other writers gird at the Buddha because most of the leaders of this Order were drawn from the ranks of the respectable and the well-to-do, with an education in keeping with their social position; and disparage him for neglecting the humble and the wretched, for not using his influence to abolish, or to mitigate, the harshness of caste rules.</P>
<P>Both views are equally unhistorical. It is well-known that the population of India is now divided into a number of sections (we call them `castes'), the members of which are debarred from the right of intermarriage (from the connubium) with those outside their caste, and also, but in constantly varying degrees, from the right of eating together (of commensality) with the members of other sections. Each such `caste' has also a council or committee by which it is governed, and which settles all disputes regarding the caste.</P>
<P>The disastrous effects, from the ethical, social, and political points of view, of these restrictions, and of caste as a whole, have been often grossly exaggerated, and the benefits of the [\q&nbsp;97/] system ignored. And we are entirely unwarranted in supposing the system, as it now exists, to have been in existence also at the time when Buddhism arose in the valley of the Ganges. Our knowledge of the actual facts of caste, even as it now exists, is still confused and inaccurate. The theories put forward to explain the facts are loose and irreconcilable. And an accurate statement of the corresponding facts, if any, at the time of Gotama, has yet to be drawn up.</P>
<P>We have long known that the connubium was the cause of a long and determined struggle between the patricians and the plebeians in Rome. Evidence has been yearly accumulating on the existence of restrictions as to intermarriage, and as to the right of eating together, among other Aryan tribes &THORN; Greeks, Germans, Russians, and so on. Even without the fact of the existence, now, of such restrictions among the modern successors of the ancient Aryans in India, it would have been almost certain that they also were addicted to similar customs. It is certain that the notion of such usages was familiar enough to some at least of the tribes that preceded the Aryans in India. It is quite a mistake to look upon all these tribes as far below the Aryans in culture. Both the Kolarians and the Dravidians were probably quite the equals of the Aryans in social organisation. And the Aryans probably adopted much from them, especially in matters relating to land tenure, village community, government, taxation, and so on. Their custom of endogamy and exogamy, their ideas as to purity and the reverse, may have differed from those of the Aryans, but were similar in kind. Rules of endogamy and exogamy; privileges, restricted to certain classes, of eating together, are not only Indian or Aryan, but worldwide phenomena. Both the spirit, and to a large degree the actual details, of modern Indian caste usages, are identical with these ancient, and no doubt universal, customs. It is in them that we have &ograve;he key to the origin of caste.</P>
<P>At any moment in the history of a nation such customs seem, to a superficial observer, to be fixed and immutable. As a matter of fact they are never quite the same in successive centuries, or even generations. A man's visible frame, though no change is at any moment perceptible, is really never the same for two consecutive moments, and the result of constant minute variations becomes clear after the lapse of time. The numerous and complicated details which we sum up under the convenient (but often misleading) single name of caste are solely dependent for their sanction on public opinion. That opinion seems stable. But it is always tending to vary as to the degree of importance attached to some particular one of [\q&nbsp;98/] the details, as to the size and complexity of the particular groups in which each detail ought to be observed.</P>
<P>This last statement may be illustrated by the case of the Chaliyas. When the Dutch started cinnamon cultivation in Ceylon on a large scale, they wanted labourers. `The peasantry, who belonged almost exclusively to one caste, the Goigamas, regarded it as unworthy of a free man to work for hire. Some of them, however, in the struggle of motives, found the pressure of poverty too strong for them, and accepted service as coolies. The others, thinking this bad form, became averse to giving their daughters in marriage to such coolies. These feelings were naturally stronger at first among the Goigamas of good social position, and it became a mark of superiority not to have a relative married to a worker in the cinnamon gardens. And such workers were called Chaliyas. By the time that the families of Chaliyas were numerous enough to afford mates for the male or female coolies, the Chaliyas found it impossible to find wives elsewhere. And thus, under the very eyes of Europeans, the size of one group had been diminished by the very considerable number of persons engaged in a new and despised trade. In other words, what we call a new caste had arisen, the caste of the Chaliyas. When the English took Ceylon they gave up the government cultivation of cinnamon. The gardens were carried on, in ever lessening numbers, by private individuals. The number of the Chaliyas consequently declined. Numbers of them, as they gradually returned to ordinary peasant work, became reabsorbed among the Goigamas. This was an instance of a change precisely contrary to that which happened when the caste gradually arose. But all did not succeed in returning; and there are, therefore, still some Chaliyas left. And the caste survives though the members of it are now no longer exclusively, or even largely, employed in cinnamon gardens; and many of them have become wealthy and honoured.</P>
<P>What had happened in this case was, not two separate and striking revolutions, but a long series of slight changes in public opinion, no doubt quite imperceptible at the time to the very people among whom the changes were taking place. And after all the changes were not so very slow. Three or four generations were enough to cover the whole series with the consequent results. Who can doubt but that the history of ancient India, if we had only access to the necessary evidence, would be found to cover, in its two thousand five hundred years, and through its wide territory, a constant succession of similar variations; and that similar variations are recurring still today.</P>
<P>[\q&nbsp;99/] Owing to the fact that the particular set of people who worked their way to the top based its claims on religious grounds, not on political power or wealth, the system has, no doubt, lasted longer in India than in Europe. But public opinion still insists in considerable circles, even in Europe, on restrictions of a more or less defined kind, both as to marriage and as to eating together. And in India the problem still remains to trace in the literature the gradual growth of the system &THORN; the gradual formation of new sections among the people, the gradual extension of the institution to the families of people engaged. in certain trades, belonging to the same sect or tribe', tracing their ancestry (whether rightly or wrongly) to the same source. All these factors, and others besides, are real factors. But they are phases of the extension and growth, not explanations of the origin, of the system.</P>
<P>There is no evidence to show that at the time when the conversations recorded in the Dialogues took place (that is to say, in the sixth century B. C.) there was any substantial difference, as regards the barriers in question, between the peoples dwelling in the valley of the Ganges and their contemporaries dwelling on the shores of the Mediterranean. The point of greatest weight in the establishment of the great difference in the subsequent development &THORN; the supremacy, in India, of the priests &THORN; was still being hotly debated. And all our evidence tends to show that at least in the wide extent of territory covered by the Pi&ntilde;akas &THORN; countries close upon a hundred thousand square miles in area &THORN; the struggle was being decided rather against the Brahman than for them. There were distinctions as to marriage; endogamous and exogamous groups. In a few instances, all among the lower classes of the people, these amounted, probably, to what would now be called caste-divisions. But of castes, in the modern sense, among the preponderating majority there is little or no conclusive evidence.</P>
<P>There was a common phrase current among the people, which divided all the world into four va&otilde;&otilde;&agrave; (colours or complexions)-the nobles, the priests, the other Aryan people, and the non-Aryan S&aring;dras (<I>Khattiy&agrave;</I>, <I>Br&agrave;hma&otilde;&agrave;</I>, <I>Vess&agrave;</I>, and <I>Sudd&agrave;</I>). The priests put themselves first, and had a theological legend in support of their contention. But it is clear from the Pi&ntilde;akas that this was not admitted by the nobles. And it is also clear that no one of these divisions was a caste. There was neither connubium nor commensality between all the members of one va&otilde;&otilde;a, nor was there a governing council for each. The fourth was distinguished from the others by race. The remaining three were distinguished from each other by [\q&nbsp;100/] social position. And though in a general rough way the classification corresponded to the actual facts of life, there were insensible gradations within the four classes, and the boundary between them was both variable and undefined.</P>
<P>And this enumeration of the populace was. not complete. Outside these classes there were others, resembling in many points the modern low castes, and always when mentioned in the Pi&ntilde;akas following after the above four. Thus in A&iuml;guttara I, 162</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM1"></A>[<A HREF="#n1">1</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> the argument is that just as there is no real difference in oxen, in spite of the fact that they can be arranged in classes by difference of colour (<I>va&otilde;&otilde;a</I>), and the strong, active, well-trained ox is selected by preference, without regard to his colour (<I>va&otilde;&otilde;a</I>) ; so also, when presenting gifts, the man of strong, active, well-trained mind should be selected as donee &THORN; without reference to the fact of his belonging to any one of the four classes of society (<I>va&otilde;&otilde;&agrave;</I>), or of his being a <I>Ka&otilde;&oacute;&agrave;la</I> or a <I>Pukkusa</I>. It is plain that this passage distinguishes the last two from the four <I>va&otilde;&otilde;&agrave;</I> and therefore from the S&aring;dras</P>
<P>Other old texts</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM2"></A>[<A HREF="#n2">2</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> insert between these two three further names &THORN; the <I>Ve&otilde;as</I>, the <I>Nes&agrave;das</I>, and the <I>Rathak&agrave;ras</I>, that is to say, the workers in rushes,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM3"></A>[<A HREF="#n3">3</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> bird-catchers, and cartmakers. By these are meant aboriginal tribesmen who were hereditary craftsmen in these three crafts; for they are called <I>h&atilde;na-j&agrave;tiyo</I>, low tribes. They no doubt formed castes in the modern sense, though we have no information as to their marriage customs. They are represented in the J&agrave;taka book as living in villages of their own, outside the towns in which ordinary people dwelt, and formed evidently a numerically insignificant portion of the populace.</P>
<P>In the last passage quoted in the previous note there are mentioned, as distinct from these low tribes (the <I>h&atilde;na-j&agrave;tiyo</I>), certain low occupations (<I>h&atilde;na-sipp&agrave;ni</I>) mat-makers, potters, weavers, leather-workers, and barbers. As they are excluded from the list of those distinguished by birth (<I>j&agrave;ti</I>), it is implied that there was no hard and fast line, determined by birth, for those who gained their living by these trades. There would be a natural tendency for the son to follow the father's craft</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM4"></A>[<A HREF="#n4">4</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">; [\q&nbsp;101/] centuries afterwards they had become castes, and they were then on the borderline. But they were not castes as yet.</P>
<P>Besides the above, who were all freemen, there were also slaves. We only hear of them quite occasionally, as domestic servants, in the houses of the very rich. Individuals had been captured in predatory raids, and reduced to slavery (J&agrave;t. IV, 220); or had been deprived of their freedom as a judicial punishment (J&agrave;t. I, 200); or had submitted to slavery of their own accord (`Vinaya Texts,' I,191; Sum. I, 168). Children born to such slaves were also slaves, and the emancipation of slaves is often referred to. But we hear nothing of such later developments of slavery as rendered the Roman latifundia, or the plantations of some Christian slave-owners, scenes of misery and oppression. For the most part the slaves were household servants, and not badly treated, and their numbers seem to have been insignificant</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM5"></A>[<A HREF="#n5">5</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>What we find then, in the Buddha's time, is caste in the making. The great mass of the people were distinguished quite roughly into four classes-social strata-of which the boundary lines were vague and uncertain. At the one end of the scale certain outlying tribes, and certain hereditary crafts of a dirty or despised kind, were already, probably, castes. At the other end of the scale Brahman by birth were putting forward caste claims that were not yet universally admitted. There were social customs about the details of which we know very little (and dependent probably, more exactly upon the gotta rather than upon the <I>j&agrave;ti</I>), which raised barriers, not seldom broken through, as to intermarriage of people admittedly belonging to the same va&otilde;&otilde;a, and a fortiori of others. And there was a social code, based on the idea of impurity, which prevented familiar intercourse (such as commensality) between people of different rank; and rendered disgraceful the use of certain foods. We find, however, no usages which cannot be amply paralleled in the history of other peoples throughout the world in similar stages of social evolution. The key-stone of the arch of the peculiarly Indian caste organisation-the absolute supremacy of the Brahmans &THORN; had not yet been put in position, had not, in fact, been yet made ready. The caste-system, in any proper or exact use of the term, did not exist.</P>
<P>In the face of this set of circumstances Gotama took up [\q&nbsp;102/] a distinct position. It meets us, it is true, in two phases; but it forms one consistent and logical whole.</P>
<P>In the first place, as regards his own Order, over which alone he had complete control, he ignores completely and absolutely all advantages or disadvantages arising from birth, occupation, and social status, and sweeps away all barriers and disabilities arising from the arbitrary rules of mere Ceremonial or social impurity.</P>
<P>One of the most distinguished members of his Order the very one of them who was referred to as the chief authority, after Gotama himself, on the rules of the Order, was Up&agrave;li, who had formerly been a barber, one of the despised occupations. So Sun&atilde;ta, one of the brethren whose verses are chosen for insertion in the Thera J&agrave;th&agrave;, was a Pukkusa, one of the low tribes. S&agrave;ti, the propounder of a deadly heresy, was of the sons of the fisherfolk, afterwards a low caste, and even then an occupation, on account of its cruelty, particularly abhorred. Nanda was a cowherd. The two Pa&otilde;&ntilde;hakas were born out of wedlock, to a girl of good family through intercourse with a slave (so that by the rule laid down in Manu 31, they were actually outcasts). K&agrave;p&agrave; was the daughter of a deer-stalker, Pu&otilde;&otilde;&agrave; and Pu&otilde;&otilde;ik&agrave; had been slave girls. Sumangalam&agrave;t&agrave; was daughter and wife to workers in rushes, and Subh&agrave; was the daughter of a smith. More instances could doubtless be quoted already, and others will become known when more texts are published.</P>
<P>It does not show much historical insight to sneer at the numbers as small, and to suggest that the supposed enlightenment or liberality was mere pretence. The facts speak for themselves; and the percentage of low-born members of the Order was probably in fair proportion to the percentage of persons belonging to the despised j&agrave;tis and sippas as compared with the rest of the population. Thus of the Ther&atilde;s mentioned in the Ther&atilde; G&agrave;th&agrave; we know the social position of sixty, of whom five are mentioned above-that is 8 1/2 per cent. of the whole number were base-born. It is most likely that this is just about the proportion which persons in similar social rank bore to the rest of the population.</P>
<P>Whether the Buddhist Order differed in this respect from the other similar communities which are mentioned in the Buddhist books as having already existed when the Buddhist Order was founded, is still matter of controversy. The Buddhist books are mostly silent on the matter. But that very silence is valuable evidence. It is scarcely likely that, if there had been much difference, there should be no allusion to it in the Pi&ntilde;akas. And the few passages in print confirm this. We [\q&nbsp;103/] have seen how in the S&agrave;ma¤¤a-phala Sutta (above, P. 77) it is taken for granted that a slave would join an Order (that is any order, not the Buddhist). And in the Agga¤¤a Sutta of the D&atilde;gha, and the Madhura Sutta of the Majjhima, there is express mention of S&aring;dras becoming Sama&otilde;as, as if it were a recognised and common occurrence, long before the time of the rise of Buddhism. So in the J&agrave;taka (III, 381) we hear of a potter, and at IV, 392 of a <I>Ka&otilde;&oacute;&agrave;la</I>, who become <I>Sama&otilde;as</I> (not Buddhist <I>Sama&otilde;as</I>).&nbsp;<A NAME="BM6"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n6">6</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>On the other hand, it is just possible that in these passages the custom afterwards followed in the Buddhist Order is simply put back to earlier times, and is an anachronism. The low-born, however earnest in their search after truth, were no doubt excluded from any community of hermits or religious recluses in which Brahmans had the upper hand. But all the twice-born (the <I>Dvijas</I>, that is the <I>Khattiyas</I>, <I>Br&agrave;hma&otilde;as</I>, and <I>Vessas</I>) were certainly justified, by public opinion, in becoming Sama&otilde;as. To what extent the S&aring;dras, and the tribes below the S&aring;dras, were accorded, in communities other than the Buddhist, a similar privilege, is at present doubtful. But the Buddha certainly adopted, and probably extended, the most rational view current at the time.</P>
<P>There is one point, however, in which he seems to have restricted (and for a valid reason) the existing custom. It is impossible to avoid the inference from the passage just referred to (in the S&agrave;ma¤¤a-phala, above, P. 77), that the existing orders, or most of them, admitted slaves to their ranks. Now among a number of rules laid down to regulate admission to the Buddhist Order, in such wise that the existing rights of third parties should not be encroached upon, there is a rule (translated in `Vinaya Texts,' S. B. E., I, 199) that no runaway slave, shall be admitted. And in the form of words to be used at the chapter held for admitting new members, one of the questions asked of the candidate is: `Are you a freeman?'</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM7"></A>[<A HREF="#n7">7</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> Whenever slaves were admitted to the Order, they must have previously obtained the consent of their masters, and also, I think, have been emancipated.</P>
<P>Secondly, as regards all such matters as we may now fairly call `questions of caste' outside the Order, the Buddha adopted the only course then open to any man of sense; that is to say, he strove to influence that public opinion, on which the observances depend, by a constant inculcation of reasonable views. Thus in the &acirc;magandha Sutta</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM8"></A>[<A HREF="#n8">8</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> of the Sutta [\q&nbsp;104/] Nip&agrave;ta (certainly one of the very oldest of our documents) it is laid down, in eloquent words, that defilement does not come from eating this or that, prepared or given by this or that person, but from evil deeds and words and thoughts.</P>
<P>This is a particularly interesting passage, being one of the few in which sayings of previous Buddhas are recorded. In other words the Buddhists put forward this view as having been enunciated long ago-with the intended implication that it was a self-evident proposition which was common ground to the wise. No originality, no special insight, is claimed on account of a view that would have put an end to so many foolish prejudices based on superstition. The Buddha's position is again to adopt, in this matter, the sensible position already put forward by others.</P>
<P>As to other details also, which it would take too long to set out here, Gotama followed the same plan. On the general question, however, he had opinions, presumably his own. For they are not found elsewhere. And in the early Buddhist texts (always ready to give credit to others, and even anxious wherever possible to support their views by showing that others, especially in ancient times, had held them) these views are not referred to as part of the doctrine of either earlier or contemporary teachers.</P>
<P>We may class the utterances on this point under three heads-biological, ethical, and historical.</P>
<P>In the V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha Sutta of the Sutta Nip&agrave;ta (several verses of which have been inserted also in the Dhammapada) the question, as in the So&otilde;ada&otilde;&oacute;a Sutta, translated below, is as to what makes a man a Brahman. As his answer the Buddha reminds his questioners of the fact that whereas, in the case of plants (large or small), insects, quadrupeds, serpents, fish, and birds, there are many species and marks (due to the species) by which they can be distinguished-in the case of man there are no such species, and no such marks. `Herein,' as pointed out by Mr. Chalmers,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM9"></A>[<A HREF="#n9">9</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> `Gotama was in accord with the conclusion of modern biologists, that &szlig;the Anthropidae are represented by the single genus and species, Man&ucirc;&THORN;a conclusion the more remarkable as the accident of colour did not mislead Gotama' as it did so many of his contemporaries then; and even, within living memory, so many in the West. He goes on to draw the conclusion that distinctions made between different men are mere matters of prejudice and custom; that it is wisdom and goodness that make the only valid distinction, that make a man a Brahman; that the [\q&nbsp;105/] Arahat is therefore the true Brahman; and that it is only the ignorant who had, for so long, maintained that it was birth that made a man a Brahman.</P>
<P>Similar arguments frequently recur. In the Madhura Sutta, a dialogue, shortly after the Buddha's death, between the king of Madhura and Kacc&agrave;na, the point raised is whether the Brahmans are right in their exclusive claims. `The Brahmans say thus, Kacc&agrave;na: &szlig;The Brahmans are the most distinguished of the four divisions into which the people is classified</FONT>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">;</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM10"></A>[<A HREF="#n10">10</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> every other division is inferior. The Brahmans are the white division; all the rest are black. The Brahmans alone are accounted pure, not those who are not Brahmans. The Brahmans are the legitimate sons of God (of Brahm&agrave;), born from His mouth, specially made by Him, heirs of Brahm&agrave;! What do you, Sir, say to this?&ucirc;'</P>
<P>The Buddhist answer is first to remind the king of the actual facts of life-how a prosperous member of any one of the four va&otilde;&otilde;as would find members of each of the other three to wait upon him and serve him. There was no difference between them in this respect. Then, secondly, he points out how a wicked man (whatever his <I>va&otilde;&otilde;a</I>), in accordance with the doctrine of Karma acknowledged by all good men (not only by Buddhists), will be reborn in some state of woe; and a good man in some state of bliss. Thirdly, a criminal, whatever his va&otilde;&otilde;a, would be equally subject to punishment for his crime. And lastly, a man, whatever his va&otilde;&otilde;a, would, on joining an order, on becoming a religieux, receive equal respect and honour from the people</FONT>].&nbsp;<A NAME="BM11"></A>[<A HREF="#n11">11</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>A Brahman might object that all this ignores the important point that the Brahman were, originally, born of Brahma, and are his legitimate heirs. It was this claim to especial connection with the mysterious powers of a supernatural kind, so widely believed in, that formed their chief weapon in the struggle. We find the Buddhist reply to that in the Agga¤¤a Sutta of the D&atilde;gha, in many respects one. of the most interesting and instructive of all the Dialogues</FONT>].&nbsp;<A NAME="BM12"></A>[<A HREF="#n12">12</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> It is a kind [\q&nbsp;106/] of Buddhist book of Genesis. In it the pretensions of the Brahman are put forward in the same terms as those just quoted above from the Madhura Sutta.</P>
<P>Gotama replies that they make these claims in forgetfulness of the past. The claims have no basis in fact. It is righteousness (<I>dhamma</I>) and not class distinction (<I>va&otilde;&otilde;a</I>) that makes the real difference between man and man</FONT>].&nbsp;<A NAME="BM13"></A>[<A HREF="#n13">13</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> Do we not daily see Brahman women with child and bearing sons just like other folk? How can they then say that they are born of God? And as to their origin, when the evolution of the world began, beings were at first immaterial, feeding on joy, giving light from themselves, passing through the air. There was thick darkness round about them, and neither sun nor moon, nor stars, nor sex, nor measures of time. Then the earth rose in the midst of the waters, beautiful as honey in taste and colour and smell, and the beings, eating thereof, lost their brightness, and then sun and moon and stars appeared, and time began to run. And then also their bodies became more coarse and material, and differences of complexion (<I>va&otilde;&otilde;a</I>) became manifest among them. Then some prided themselves, and despised others, on the ground of their finer complexion. And thereupon the fine-tasting earth ceased to be so.</P>
<P>Then successively fine moss, and sweet creepers, and delicate rice appeared, and each time the beings ate thereof with a similar result. Then differences of sex appeared; and households were formed; and the lazy stored up the rice, instead of gathering it each evening and morning; and the rights of property arose, and were infringed. And when lusts were felt, and thefts committed, the beings, now become men, met together, and chose certain men, differing from the others in no wise except in virtue (<I>dhamma</I>), to restrain the evil doers by blame or fines or banishment. These were the first Kshatriyas. And others they chose to restrain the evil dispositions which led to the evil doing. And these were the first Brahman, differing from the others in no wise, except only in virtue (<I>dhamma</I>).</P>
<P>Then certain others, to keep their households going, and maintain their wives, started occupations of various kinds. And these were the first vessas. And some abandoned their homes and became the first recluses (<I>sama&otilde;as</I>). But all were alike in origin, and the only distinction between them was in virtue. And the highest of them all was acknowledged [\q&nbsp;107/] to be the Arahat, who had made himself so by the destruction of the Four Mental Intoxications (the <I>&agrave;savas</I>) and by breaking the bonds that tied him to rebirths; the man who had laid aside every burden, who had lived the life, had accomplished a11 that had to be done, had gained his end, and by the highest knowledge was set free!</P>
<P>We may not accept the historical accuracy of this legend. Indeed a continual note of good-humoured irony runs through the whole story, with its fanciful etymologies of the names of the four va&otilde;&otilde;&agrave;; and the aroma of it would be lost on the hearer who took it au grand szeezrieux. But it reveals a sound and healthy insight, and is much nearer to the actual facts than the Brahman legend it was intended to replace.</P>
<P>Had the Buddha's views on the whole question won the day-and widely shared, as they were, by others, they very nearly prevailed-the evolution of social grades and distinctions would have gone on in India on lines similar to those it followed in the West, and the caste system of India would never have been built up</FONT>].&nbsp;<A NAME="BM14"></A>[<A HREF="#n14">14</A>]</P>

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>2. Now the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM16"></A>[<A HREF="#n16">16</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> heard the news:</P>
<P>[\q&nbsp;109/] `They say that the Sama&otilde;a Gotama, of the S&agrave;kya clan, who went out from a S&agrave;kya family to adopt the religious life, has now arrived, with a great company of the brethren of his Order, at Icch&agrave;nankala, and is staying there in the Icch&agrave;nankala Wood. Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad:¤That Blessed One is an Arahat, a fully awakened one, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher for gods and men, a Blessed One, a Buddha. He, by himself, thoroughly knows and sees, as it were, face to face this universe,¤including the worlds above of the gods, the Brahmas, and the M&agrave;ras, and the world below with its recluses and Brahman, its princes and peoples,¤and having known it, he makes his knowledge known to others. The truth, lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation, doth he proclaim, both in the spirit and in the letter, the higher life doth he make known, in all its fullness and in all its purity.</P>
<P>[88] `And good is it to pay visits to Arahats like that.'</P>
<P>3. Now at that time a young Brahman, an Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM17"></A>[<A HREF="#n17">17</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> was a pupil under Pokkharas&agrave;di the Brahman. And he was a repeater (of the sacred words) knowing the mystic verses by heart, one who had mastered the Three Vedas, with the indices, the ritual, the phonology, and the exegesis (as a fourth),</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM18"></A>[<A HREF="#n18">18</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> and the legends [\q&nbsp;110/] as a fifth, learned in the idioms and the grammar, versed in Lok&agrave;yata sophistry, and in the theory of the signs on the body of a great man,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM19"></A>[<A HREF="#n19">19</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">¤so recognised an authority in the system of the threefold Vedic knowledge as expounded by his master, that he could say of him: `What I know that you know, and what you know that I know.'</P>
<P>4. And Pokkharas&agrave;di told Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha the news, and said: `Come now, dear Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, go to the Sama&otilde;a Gotama, and find out whether the reputations so noised abroad regarding him is in accord with the facts or not, whether the Sama&otilde;a Gotama is such as they say or not.'</P>
<P>5. `But how, Sir, shall I know whether that is so or not?'</P>
<P>`There have been handed down, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, in our mystic verses thirty-two bodily signs of a great man,¤ signs which, if a man has, he will become one of two things, and no other.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM20"></A>[<A HREF="#n20">20</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> If he dwells at home he will become a sovran of the world, a righteous king, bearing rule even to the shores of the four great oceans, a conqueror, the protector of his people, possessor of the seven royal treasures. [89] And these are the seven treasures that he has¤the Wheel, the Elephant, the Horse, the Gem, the Woman, the Treasurer, and the [\q&nbsp;111/] Adviser as a seventh.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM21"></A>[<A HREF="#n21">21</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> And he has more than a thousand sons, heroes, mighty in frame, beating down the armies of the foe. And he dwells in complete ascendancy over the wide earth from sea to sea, ruling it in righteousness without the need of baton or of sword. But if he go forth from the household life into the houseless state, then he will become a Buddha who removes the veil from the eyes of the world. Now I, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, am a giver of the mystic verses; you have received them from me.'</P>
<P>6. `Very good, Sir,' said Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha in reply; and rising from his seat and paying reverence to Pokkharas&agrave;di, he mounted a chariot drawn by mares, and proceeded, with a retinue of young Brahman, to the Icch&agrave;nankala Wood. And when he had gone on in the chariot as far as the road was practicable for vehicles, he got down, and went on, into the park, on foot.</P>
<P>7. Now at that time a number of the brethren were walking up and down in the open air. And Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha went up to them, and said: `Where may the venerable Gotama be lodging now? We have come hither to call upon him.'</P>
<P>8. Then the brethren thought: `This young Brahman Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha is of distinguished family, and a pupil of the distinguished Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di. The Blessed One will not find it difficult to hold conversation with such.' And they said to Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha: `There, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, is his lodging,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM22"></A>[<A HREF="#n22">22</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> where the door is shut, go quietly up and enter the porch gently, and give a cough, and knock on the cross-bar. The Blessed One will open the door for you.'</P>
<P>9. Then Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha did so. And the Blessed One opened the door, and Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha entered in. And the other young Brahman also went in; and they exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and [\q&nbsp;112/] compliments of politeness and courtesy, and took their seats. But Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, walking about, said something or other of a civil kind in an off-hand way, fidgeting about the while, or standing up, to the Blessed One sitting there.</P>
<P>[90] 10. And the Blessed One said to him: `Is that the way, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, that you would hold converse with aged teachers, and teachers of your teachers well stricken in years, as you now do, moving about the while or standing, with me thus seated?'</P>
<P>11. `Certainly not, Gotama. It is proper to speak with a Brahman as one goes along only when the Brahman himself is walking, and standing to a Brahman who stands, and seated to a Brahman who has taken his seat, or reclining to a Brahman who reclines. But with shavelings, sham friars, menial black fellows, the offscouring of our kinsman's heels</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM23"></A>[<A HREF="#n23">23</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">¤with them I would talk as I now do to you!'</P>
<P>`But you must have been wanting something, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, when you came here. Turn your thoughts rather to the object you had in view when you came. This young Brahman Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha is ill bred, though he prides himself on his culture; what can this come from except from want of training?'</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM24"></A>[<A HREF="#n24">24</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>12. Then Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha was displeased and angry with the Blessed One at being called rude; and at the thought that the Blessed One was vexed with him, he said, scoffing, jeering, and sneering at the Blessed One: `Rough is this S&agrave;kya breed of yours, Gotama, and rude; touchy is this S&agrave;kya breed of yours and [\q&nbsp;113/] violent.</P>
<P>[91] Menials, mere menials,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM25"></A>[<A HREF="#n25">25</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> they neither venerate, nor value, nor esteem, nor give gifts to, nor pay honour to Brahman. That, Gotama, is neither fitting, nor is it seemly!'</P>
<P>Thus did the young Brahman Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha for the first time charge the S&agrave;kyas with being menials.</P>
<P>13. `But in what then, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, have the S&agrave;kyas given you offence?'</P>
<P>`Once, Gotama, I had to go to Kapilavatthu on some business or other of Pokkharas&agrave;di's, and went into the S&agrave;kyas' Congress Hall.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM26"></A>[<A HREF="#n26">26</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> Now at that time there were a number of S&agrave;kyas, old and young, seated in the hall on grand seats, making merry and joking together, nudging one another with their fingers;</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM27"></A>[<A HREF="#n27">27</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> and for a truth, methinks, it was I myself that was the subject of their jokes; and not one of them even offered me a seat. That, Gotama, is neither fitting, nor is it seemly, that the S&agrave;kyas, menials as they are, mere menials, should neither venerate, nor value, nor esteem, nor give gifts to, nor pay honour to Brahman.'</P>
<P>Thus did the young Brahman Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha for the second time charge the S&agrave;kyas with being menials.</P>
<P>[\q&nbsp;114/] 14. `Why a quail, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, little hen bird though she be, can say what she likes in her own nest. And there the S&agrave;kyas are at their own home, in Kapilavatthu. It is not fitting for you to take offence at so trifling a thing.'</P>
<P>15. `There are these four grades</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM28"></A>[<A HREF="#n28">28</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> Gotama,¤the nobles, the Brahman, the tradesfolk, and the workpeople. And of these four, three¤the nobles, the tradesfolk, and the work-people¤are, verily, but attendants on the Brahman. [92] So, Gotama, that is neither fitting, nor is it seemly, that the, S&agrave;kyas, menials as they are, mere menials, should neither venerate, nor value, nor esteem, nor give gifts to, nor pay honour to the Brahman.'</P>
<P>Thus did the young Brahman Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha for the third time charge the S&agrave;kyas with being menials.</P>
<P>16. Then the Blessed One thought thus: `This Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha is very set on humbling the S&agrave;kyas with his charge of servile origin in. What if I were to ask him as to his own lineage?' And he said to him:</P>
<P>`And what family do you then, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, belong to?'</P>
<P>`I am a Ka&otilde;h&agrave;yana.'</P>
<P>`Yes, but if one were to follow up your ancient name and lineage, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, on the father's and the mother's side, it would appear that the S&agrave;kyas were once your masters, and that you are the offspring of one of their slave girls. But the S&agrave;kyas trace their line back to Okk&agrave;ka the king.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM29"></A>[<A HREF="#n29">29</A>]</P>
<P>`<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">Long ago, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, King Okk&agrave;ka, wanting to divert the succession in favour of the son of his favourite queen, banished his elder children¤Okk&agrave;mukha, Kara&otilde;&oacute;a Hatthinika, and Sinipura¤from the land. And being thus banished they took up their dwelling on the slopes of the Him&agrave;laya, on the borders of a lake where a mighty oak tree grew.</P>
<P>[\q&nbsp;115/] And through fear of injuring the purity of their line they intermarried with their sisters.</P>
<P>`Now Okk&agrave;ka the king asked the ministers at his court: &szlig;Where, Sirs, are the children now?&ucirc;</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM30"></A>[<A HREF="#n30">30</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`There is a spot, Sire, on the slopes of the Him&agrave;laya, on the, borders of a lake, where there grows a mighty oak (<I>sako</I>). There do they dwell. And lest they should injure the purity of their line they have married their own (<I>sak&agrave;hi</I>) sisters.'</P>
<P>`Then did Okk&agrave;ka the king burst forth in admiration [93]: &szlig;Hearts of oak (<I>saky&agrave;</I>) are those young fellows! Right well they hold their own (<I>paramasaky&agrave;</I>)!&ucirc;&nbsp;<A NAME="BM31"></A></FONT>[<A HREF="#n31">31</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`That is the reason, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, why they are known as S&agrave;kyas. Now Okk&agrave;ka had a slave girl called Dis&agrave;. She gave birth to a black baby. And no sooner was it born than the little black thing said, &szlig;Wash me, mother. Bathe me, mother. Set me free, mother, of this dirt. So shall I be of use to you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>`Now just as now, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, people- call devils &szlig;devils,&ucirc; so then they called devils &szlig;black fellows&ucirc; (<I>ka&otilde;he</I>). And they said: &szlig;This fellow spoke as soon as he was born. `Tis a black thing (<I>ka&otilde;ha</I>) that is born, a devil has been born!&ucirc; And that is the origin, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, of the Ka&otilde;h&agrave;yanas.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM32"></A>[<A HREF="#n32">32</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> He was the ancestor of the Ka&otilde;h&agrave;yanas.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM33"></A>[<A HREF="#n33">33</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> And thus is it, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, that if one were to follow up your ancient name and lineage, on the father's and on the mother's side, it would appear that the S&agrave;kyas were once your masters, and that you are the offspring of one of their slave girls.'</P>
<P>17. When he had thus spoken the young Brahman said to the Blessed One: `Let not the venerable [\q&nbsp;116/] Gotama humble Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha too sternly with this reproach of being descended from a slave girl. He is well born, Gotama, and of good family; he is versed in the sacred hymns, an able reciter, a learned man. And he is able to give answer to the venerable Gotama in these matters.'</P>
<P>18. Then the Blessed One said to them: `Quite so. If 194] you thought otherwise, then it would be for you to carry on our discussion further. But as you think so, let Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha himself speak.'</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM34"></A>[<A HREF="#n34">34</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>19. ` We do think so; and we will hold our peace. Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha is able to give answer to the venerable Gotama in these matters.'</P>
<P>20. Then the Blessed One said to Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha the Brahman: `Then this further question arises, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, a very reasonable one which, even though unwillingly, you should answer. If you do not give a clear reply, or go off upon another issue,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM35"></A>[<A HREF="#n35">35</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> or remain silent, or go away, then your head will split in pieces on the spot.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM36"></A>[<A HREF="#n36">36</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> What have you heard, when Brahman old and well stricken in years, teachers of yours or their teachers, were talking together, as to whence the Ka&otilde;h&agrave;yanas draw their origin, and who the ancestor was to whom they trace themselves back?'</P>
<P>And when he had thus spoken Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha remained silent. And the Blessed One asked the same question again. [95] And still Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha remained silent. Then the Blessed One said to him: `You [\q&nbsp;117/] had better answer, now, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha. This is no time for you to hold your peace. For whosoever, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, does not, even up to the third time of asking, answer a reasonable question put by a Tath&agrave;gata (by one who has won the truth), his head splits into pieces `on the spot.'</P>
<P>21. Now at that time the spirit who bears the thunderbolt</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM37"></A>[<A HREF="#n37">37</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> stood over above Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha in the sky with a mighty mass of iron, all fiery, dazzling, and aglow, with the intention, if he did not answer, there and then to split his head in pieces. And the Blessed One perceived the spirit bearing the thunderbolt, and so did Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha the Brahman. And Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha on becoming aware of it, terrified, startled, and agitated, seeking safety and protection and help from the Blessed One, crouched down beside him in awe,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM38"></A>[<A HREF="#n38">38</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> and said: `What was it the Blessed One said? Say it once again!'</P>
<P>`What do you think, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha? What have you heard, when Brahman old and well stricken in years, teachers of yours or their teachers, were talking together, as to whence the Ka&otilde;h&agrave;yanas draw their origin, and who the ancestor was to whom they trace themselves back?'</P>
<P>`Just so, Gotama, did I hear, even as the venerable Gotama hath said. That is the origin of the Ka&otilde;h&agrave;yanas, and that the ancestor to whom they trace themselves back.'</P>
<P>22. And when he had thus spoken the. young Brahman fell into tumult, and uproar, and turmoil; and said: `Low born, they say, is Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha the Brahman; his family, they say, is not of good standing; they say he is descended from a slave girl; and the S&agrave;kyas were his masters. We did not suppose that the Sama&otilde;a Gotama, whose words are righteousness itself, was not a man to be trusted!'</P>
<P>23. And the Blessed One thought: [96] `They [\q&nbsp;118/] go too far, these Brahman, in their depreciation of Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha as the offspring of a slave girl. Let me set him free from their reproach.' And he said to them: `Be not too severe in disparaging Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha the Brahman on the ground of his descent. That Ka&otilde;ha became a mighty seer.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM39"></A>[<A HREF="#n39">39</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> He went into the Dekkan, there he learnt mystic verses, and returning to Okk&agrave;ka the king, he demanded his daughter. Madda-r&aring;p&atilde; in marriage. To him the king in answer said: &szlig;Who forsooth is this fellow, who &THORN; son of my slave girl as he is &THORN; asks for my daughter in marriage;&ucirc; and, angry and displeased, he fitted an arrow to his bow. But neither could he let the arrow fly, nor could he take it off the string again.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM40"></A>[<A HREF="#n40">40</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`Then the ministers and courtiers went to Ka&otilde;ha the seer, and said &szlig;Let the king go safe, Sir; let the king go safe."</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM41"></A>[<A HREF="#n41">41</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>&szlig;The king shall suffer no harm. But should he shoot the arrow downwards, then would the earth dry up as far as his realm extends.&ucirc;</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM42"></A>[<A HREF="#n42">42</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>&szlig;Let the king, Sir, go safe, and the country too.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;The king shall suffer no harm, nor his land. But should he shoot the arrow upwards, the god would not rain for seven years as far as his realm extends.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Let the king, Sir, go safe, and the country too; and let the god rain.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;The king shall suffer no harm, nor the land either, and the god shall rain. But let the king aim the arrow at his eldest son. The prince shall suffer no harm, not a hair of him shall be touched."</P>
<P>Then, O Brahmans, the ministers told this to Okk&agrave;ka, [\q&nbsp;119/] and said: &szlig;Let the king aim at his eldest son.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM43"></A>[<A HREF="#n43">43</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> He will suffer neither harm nor terror.&ucirc; And the king did so, and no harm was done. But the king, terrified at the lesson given him, [97] gave the man his daughter Madda-r&aring;p&atilde; to wife. You should not, O Brahmans, be too severe to disparage Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha in the matter of his slave-girl ancestress. That Ka&otilde;ha was a mighty seer.'</P>
<P>24. Then the Blessed One said to Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha: `What think you, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha? Suppose a young Kshatriya should have connection with a Brahman maiden, and from their intercourse a son should be born. Now would the son thus come to the Brahman maiden through the Kshatriya youth receive a seat and water (as tokens of respect) from the Brahmans?"</P>
<P>`Yes, he would, Gotama.'</P>
<P>`But would the Brahman allow him to partake of the feast offered to the dead, or of the food boiled in milk,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM44"></A>[<A HREF="#n44">44</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> or of the offerings to the gods, or of food sent as a present?'</P>

<P>25. `Then what think you, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha? Suppose a Brahman youth should have connection with a Kshatriya maiden, and from their intercourse a son should be born. Now would the son thus come to the Kshatriya maiden through the Brahman youth receive [\q&nbsp;120/] a seat and water (as tokens of respect) from the Brahmans?'</P>

<P>26. `Then, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, whether one compares women with women, or men with men, the Kshatriyas are higher and the Brahmans inferior.</P>
<P>`And what think you, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha?

<P>[99] `But thereby, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, the Kshatriya would have fallen into the deepest degradation, shaven as to his head, cut dead with the ash-basket, banished from land and township.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`Not that, Gotama. How little is it that I can profess [\q&nbsp;127/] to have learnt! How supreme this Perfection of wisdom and conduct! Far is it from me to have been trained therein?'</P>

<P>`Not even that, Gotama.'</P>

And your teacher too, the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di, has told you this saying: &szlig;Who are these shavelings, sham friars, menial black fellows, the offscouring of our kinsman's heels, that they should claim converse with Brahmans versed in the threefold Vedic lore!&ucirc; &THORN;he himself not having even fulfilled any one even of these lesser duties (which lead men to neglect the higher ones). See, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, how deeply your teacher, the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di, has herein done you wrong.'</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM59"></A>[<A HREF="#n59">59</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>6. `And the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, is in the enjoyment of a grant from Pasenadi, the king of Kosala. But the king, does not allow him to come into his presence. When he consults with him he speaks to him only from behind a curtain. How is it, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, that the very king, from whom he accepts this pure and lawful maintenance, King Pasenadi of Kosala, does not admit him to his presence? See, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, how deeply your teacher, the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di, has herein done you wrong.'</P>
<P>7. `Now what think you, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha? Suppose a king, either seated on the neck of his elephant or on the back of his horse, or standing on the footrug of his chariot, [104] should discuss some resolution of state with his chiefs or princes. And suppose as he left the spot and stepped on one side, a workman (<I>S&aring;dra</I>) or the slave of a workman should come up and, standing there, should discuss [\q&nbsp;129/] the matter, saying: &szlig;Thus and thus said Pasenadi the king.&ucirc; Although he should speak as the king might have spoken, or discuss as the king might have done, would he thereby be the king, or even as one of his officers?'</P>
<P>`Certainly not, Gotama.'</P>
<P>8. `But just so, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, those ancient poets (<I>Rishis</I>) of the Brahmans, the authors of the verses, the utterers of the verses, whose ancient form of words so chanted, uttered, or composed, the Brahmans of today chant over again and rehearse, intoning or reciting exactly as has been intoned or recited -to wit, A&ntilde;&ntilde;haka, V&agrave;maka, V&agrave;madeva, Vess&agrave;mitta, Yamataggi. Angirasa, Bh&agrave;radvaja, V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, Kassapa, and Bhagu</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM60"></A>[<A HREF="#n60">60</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> &THORN; though you can say: &szlig;I, as a pupil, know by heart their verses,&ucirc; that you should on that account be a Rishi, or have attained to the state of a Rishi &THORN; such a condition of things has no existence!'</P>
<P>9. `Now what think you, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha? What have you heard when Brahmans, old and well stricken in years, teachers of yours or their teachers, were talking together -did those ancient Rishis, whose verses you so chant over and repeat, parade about well groomed, perfumed, trimmed as to their hair and beard, adorned with garlands and gems, clad in white garments, in the full possession and enjoyment of the five pleasures of sense, as you, and your teacher too, do now?'</P>
<P>[105] `Not that, Gotama.'</P>
<P>`Or did they live, as their food, on boiled rice of the best sorts, from which all the black specks had been sought out and removed, and flavoured with sauces and curries of various kinds, as you, and your teacher too, do now.</P>
<P>`Not that, Gotama.'</P>
<P>`Or were they waited upon by women with fringes [\q&nbsp;130/] and furbelows,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM61"></A>[<A HREF="#n61">61</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> round their loins, as you, and your teacher too, do now?'</P>
<P>`Or did they go about driving chariots, drawn, by mares with plaited manes and tails,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM62"></A>[<A HREF="#n62">62</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> using long wands and goads the while, as you, and your teacher too, do now?'</P>
<P>`Not that, Gotama.'</P>
<P>`Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns, with moats dug out round them</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM63"></A>[<A HREF="#n63">63</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> and crossbars let down before the gates,</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM64"></A>[<A HREF="#n64">64</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> by men girt with long swords, as you, and your teacher too, do now?'</P>
<P>`Not that, Gotama.'</P>
<P>10. `So then, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, neither are you a Rishi, nor your teacher, nor do you live under the conditions under which the Rishis lived. But whatever it may be, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, concerning which you are in doubt or perplexity about me, ask me as to that. I will make it clear by explanation.'</P>
<P>11. Then the Blessed One went, forth from his chamber, and began to walk up and down. And Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha did the same. And as he thus walked [\q&nbsp;131/] up and down, following the Blessed One, he took stock of the thirty-two signs of a great man, whether they appeared on the body of the Blessed One or not. And he perceived them all save only two. [106] With respect to those two &THORN; the concealed member and the extent of tongue</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM65"></A>[<A HREF="#n65">65</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> &THORN; he was in doubt and perplexity, not satisfied, not sure.</P>
<P>12. And the Blessed One knew that he was so in doubt. And he so arranged matters by his Wondrous Gift that Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha the Brahman saw how that part of the Blessed One that ought to be hidden by clothes was enclosed in a sheath. And the Blessed One so bent round his tongue that he touched and stroked both his ears, touched and stroked both his nostrils, and the whole circumference of his forehead he covered with his tongue.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM66"></A>[<A HREF="#n66">66</A>]</P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>[\q&nbsp;132/] And Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, the young Brahman, thought: `The Sama&otilde;a Gotama is endowed with the thirty two signs of a great man, with them all, not only with some of them.' And he said to the Blessed One: `And now, Gotama, we would `fain depart. We are busy, and have much to do.'</P>
<P>`Do, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, what seemeth to you fit.'</P>
<P>And Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha mounted his chariot drawn by mares, and departed thence.</P>
<P>13. Now at that time the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di had gone forth from Ukka&ntilde;&ntilde;ha with a great retinue of Brahmans, and was seated in his own pleasaunce waiting there for Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha. And Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha came on to the pleasaunce. And when he had come in his chariot as far as the path was practicable for chariots, he descended from it, and came on foot to where Pokkharas&agrave;di was, and saluted him, and took his seat respectfully on one side. And when he was so seated, Pokkharas&agrave;di said to him:</P>
<P>14. `Well, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha! Did you see the Blessed One?'</P>
<P>`Yes, Sir, we saw him.'</P>
<P>`Well! is the venerable Gotama so as the reputation [107] about him I told you of declares; and not otherwise. Is he such a one, or is he not?'</P>
<P>`He is so, Sir, as his reputation declares, and not otherwise. Such is he, not different. And he is endowed with the thirty-two signs of a great man, with all of them, not only with some.'</P>
<P>`And did you have any talk, Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, with the Sama&otilde;a Gotama?'</P>
<P>`Yes, Sir, I had.'</P>
<P>`And how did the talk go?'</P>
<P>Then Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha told the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di all the talk that he had had with the Blessed One.</P>
<P>15. When he had thus spoken, Pokkharas&agrave;di said to him: `Oh! you wiseacre! Oh! you dullard! Oh! you [\q&nbsp;133/] expert, forsooth, in our threefold Vedic lore! A man, they say, who should carry out his business thus, must, on the dissolution of the body, after death, be reborn into some dismal state of misery and woe. What could the very points you pressed in your insolent words lead up to, if not to the very disclosures the venerable Gotama made<A NAME="BM67"></A></FONT>?&nbsp;[<A HREF="#n67">67</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> What a wiseacre; what a dullard; what an expert, forsooth, in our threefold Vedic lore.' And angry and displeased, he struck out with his foot, and rolled Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha over. And he wanted, there and then, himself, to go and call on the Blessed One.</P>
<P>[l08] 16. But the Brahman there spake thus to Pokkharas&agrave;di: `It is much too late, Sir, today to go to call on the Sama&otilde;a Gotama. The venerable Pokkharas&agrave;di can do so tomorrow.'</P>
<P>So Pokkharas&agrave;di had sweet food, both hard and soft, made ready at his own house, and taken on wagons, by the light of blazing torches, out to Ukka&ntilde;&ntilde;ha. And he himself went on to the Icch&agrave;nankala Wood, driving in his chariot as far as the road was practicable for vehicles, and then going on, on foot, to where the Blessed One was. And when he had exchanged with the Blessed One the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy, he took his seat on one side, and said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P>17. `Has our pupil, Gotama, the young Brahman Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, been here?'</P>
<P>`Yes, Brahman, he has.'</P>
<P>`And did you, Gotama, have any talk with him?'</P>
<P>`Yes, Brahman, I had.'</P>
<P>`And on what wise was the talk that you had with him.'</P>
<P>18. Then the Blessed One told the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di all the talk that had taken place. And when [\q&nbsp;134/] he had thus spoken Pokkharas&agrave;di said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P>`He is young and foolish, Gotama, that young Brahman Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha. Forgive him, Gotama.'</P>
<P>`Let him be quite happy, Brahman, `that young Brahman Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha.'</P>
<P>[109] 19. And the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di took stock, on the body of the Blessed One, of the thirty-two marks of a Great Being. And he saw them all plainly, save only two. As to two of them &THORN; the sheath-concealed member and the extensive tongue &THORN; he was still in doubt and undecided. But the Blessed One showed them to Pokkharas&agrave;di, even as he had shown them to Amba&ntilde;&ntilde;ha.</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM68"></A>[<A HREF="#n68">68</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> And Pokkharas&agrave;di perceived that the Blessed One was endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Being, with all of them, not only with some. And he said to the Blessed One: `May the venerable Gotama grant me the favour of taking his tomorrow's meal with me, and also the members of the Order with him.' And the Blessed One accepted, by silence, his request.</P>
<P>20. Then the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di, seeing that the Blessed One had accepted, had (on the morrow) the time announced to him: `It is time, oh Gotama, the meal is ready.' And the Blessed One, who had dressed in the early morning, put on his outer robe, and taking his bowl with him, went, with the brethren, to Pokkharas&agrave;di's house, and sat down on the seat prepared for him. And Pokkharas&agrave;di, the Brahman, satisfied the Blessed One, with his own hand, with sweet food, both hard and soft, until he refused any more, and the young Brahmans the members of the Order. And when the Blessed One had finished his meal, and cleansed the bowl and his</FONT>&nbsp;<A NAME="BM69"></A>[<A HREF="#n69">69</A>]<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> hands, Pokkharas&agrave;di took a low seat, and sat down beside him.</P>
<P>21. Then to him thus seated [110] the Blessed One [\q&nbsp;135/] discoursed in due order; that is to say, he spake to him of generosity, of right conduct, of heaven, of the danger. the vanity, and the defilement of lusts, of the advantages of renunciation. And when the Blessed, One saw that Pokkharas&agrave;di, the Brahman, had become prepared, softened, unprejudiced, upraised, and believing in heart, then he proclaimed the doctrine the Buddhas alone have won; that is to say, the doctrine of sorrow, of its origin, of its cessation, and of the Path. And just as a clean cloth from which all stain has been washed away will readily take the dye, just even so did Pokkharas&agrave;di, the Brahman, obtain, even while sitting there, the pure and spotless Eye for the Truth, and he knew: `Whatsoever has a beginning in that is inherent also the necessity of dissolution.'</P>
<P>22. And then the Brahman Pokkharas&agrave;di, as one who had seen the Truth, had mastered it, understood it, dived deep down into it, who had passed beyond doubt and put away perplexity and gained full confidence, who had become dependent on no other man for his knowledge of the teaching of the Master, addressed the Blessed One, and said:</P>
<P>`Most excellent, oh Gotama (are the words of thy mouth), most excellent! just as if a man were to set up that which has been thrown down, or were to reveal that which has been hidden away, or were to point out the right road to him who has gone. astray, or were to bring a light into the darkness so that those who had eyes could see external forms, &THORN; just even so, Lord, has the truth been made known to me, in many a figure, by the venerable Gotama. And I, oh Gotama, with my sons, and my wife, and my people, and my companions, betake myself to the venerable Gotama as my guide, to the truth, and to the Order. May the venerable Gotama accept me as a disciple, as one who, from this day forth, as long as life endures, has taken him as his guide. And just as the venerable Gotama visits the families of others, his disciples, at Ukka&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, so let him visit [\q&nbsp;136/] mine. Whosoever there may be there, of Brahman or their wives, who shall pay reverence to the venerable Gotama, or stand up in his presence, or offer him a seat or water, or take delight in him, to him that will be, for long, a cause of weal and bliss.'</P>
<P>`It is well, Brahman, what you say.'</P>

If the king had full proprietary (zemindary) rights as well, which is the probable meaning of r&agrave;ja-bhogga&uuml;, his share would be, either with or without the land tax, on half. The grant would be of his own rights only. The rights of the peasants to the other half, and the use of the common and waste and woods, would remain to them. If Buddhaghosa's interpretation of brahmadeyya&uuml; is correct, then the grantee would also be the king's representative for all purposes judicial and executive. Elsewhere the word has only been found as applied to marriage; and the first part of the compound (brahma) has always been interpreted by Brahmans as referring to themselves. But brahma as the first part of a compound never has that meaning in P&agrave;li; and the word in our passage means literally `a full gift.'</P>
