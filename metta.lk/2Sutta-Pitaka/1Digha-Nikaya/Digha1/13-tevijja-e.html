TO THE<BR>
TEVIJJA SUTTA</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>THIS is the only Suttanta, among the thirteen translated in this volume, in which the discourse does not lead up to Arahatship. It leads up only to the so&THORN;called <I>Brahma Vih&agrave;ras&THORN;</I>the<I> </I>supreme conditions&THORN;four states of mind held to result, after death, in a rebirth in the heavenly worlds of Brahm&agrave;. Why is it&THORN;the Buddhist ideal being Arahatship, which leads to no rebirth at all&THORN;that this lower ideal is thus suddenly introduced?</P>
<P>It would seem that the particular point here discussed was regarded as so important that it could scarcely be left out. And when we recollect that the highest teaching current before the Buddha, and still preserved in the pre-Buddhistic Upanishads, was precisely about union with Brahm&agrave;; we may, without much danger of error, explain the position occupied in the series of dialogues by this Suttanta by the supposition that it was deliberately inserted here as the Buddhist answer to the Upanishad theory. In this respect it is noteworthy that the neuter Brahman is quietly ignored. That is quite in accordance with the method of the Suttantas. The Buddha is in them often represented as using, in his own sense, words familiar to his interlocutors in a different sense. The neuter Brahman is, so far as I am aware, entirely unknown in the Nik&agrave;yas, and of course the Buddha's idea of Brahm&agrave;, in the masculine, really differs widely from that of the Upanishads.</P>
<P>There is nothing original in the Buddhist belief that a man's habit of mind at the time of his death would determine, save only in the one case of the Arahat, the nature of his rebirth. It is an Indian&THORN;not an exclusively Buddhist theory. The Buddhist texts represent it as held by non-Buddhists, and already long before. the Buddha's time, and as accepted by all as a matter of course. And it is even not exclusively Indian. As I have pointed out elsewhere, it is [\q&nbsp;299/] ascribed by Plato to Socrates<A NAME="BM1"></A>. </FONT><A HREF="#n1"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">[1]</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> The essentially Buddhist parts of the theory are three. In the first place, the choice of the particular details they held essential to such a habit of mind as would lead to rebirth in the Brahm&agrave;-worlds ; secondly, their doctrine that there was not really any 'soul' to be reborn ; and thirdly, that the highest ideal was not to be reborn at all (even only once, and into union with Brahm&agrave;).</P>
<P>The J&agrave;taka commentary in numerous passages states that the four Brahma vih&agrave;ras were practised, long before the time of the rise of Buddhism, by the sages of old. I have not found such a statement in the Nik&agrave;yas; and it is most probable therefore that the J&agrave;taka commentator is ante-dating the particular meditations in question. However this may be, they remained, throughout the long history of Buddhism, an essential part of Buddhist practice. They are even mentioned in the J&agrave;taka M&agrave;l&agrave;, a work usually supposed to be Mah&agrave;y&agrave;nist, and dated about a thousand years later than the Buddha. <A NAME="BM2"></A></FONT><A HREF="#n2"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">[2]</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> They are well-known to-day in Burma, Siam, and Ceylon. And it would be interesting to know whether they still form a part of the regulated meditations which are known to be practised by Buddhists in Thibet, China, and Japan. But they have not been found in any Indian book not a Buddhist work, and are therefore almost certainly exclusively Buddhist. Even the most determined anti-Buddhist must admit the beauty of the language (in spite of its repetitions?? 76-78), the subtle depth of the ideas, and the great value of the practice from the point of view of ethical self-training. He would probably rejoin, and with truth, that similar sentiments are met with in other (post-Buddhistic) Indian books. But it is one thing to give expression in isolated passages to such views, and quite another to have selected just these four as the four cornerstones of habitual endeavour.</P>
<P>It should be recollected that the argument here is only an <I>argumettium ad hominem. </I>If you want union with Brahm&agrave;&THORN; which you had much better not want&THORN;this is the way to attain to it. <A NAME="BM3"></A></FONT><A HREF="#n3"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">[3]</FONT></A></P>

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>1. Thus have I heard. When the Exalted One was once journeying through Kosala with a great company of the brethren, with about five hundred brethren, he came to the Brahman village in Kosala which is called Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a. And there at Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a the Exalted One stayed in the mango grove, on the bank of the river Aciravat&atilde;, to the north of Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a.</P>
<P>2. Now at that time many very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans were staying at Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a; to wit, Ka&iuml;k&atilde; the Brahman, T&agrave;rukkha the Brahman, Pokkharas&agrave;di the Brahman, J&agrave;&otilde;usso&otilde;i the Brahman, Todeyya the Brahman, and other very distinguished and wealthy Brahmans. <A NAME="BM5"></A></FONT><A HREF="#n5"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">[5]</FONT></A></P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>[\q&nbsp;301/] 3.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>4. The young Brahman V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha spake thus:</P>

<P>5. The young Brahman Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja spake thus:</P>
<P>`This is the straight path, this the direct way which makes for salvation, and leads him, who acts according to it, into a state of union with Brahm&agrave;. I mean that which has been announced by the Brahman T&agrave;rukkha.'</P>
<P>6. But neither was the young Brahman V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha able to convince the young Brahman Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, nor was the young Brahman Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja able to convince the young Brahman V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha.</P>
<P>7. Then the young Brahman V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha said to the young Brahman Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja:</P>
<P>`That Sama&otilde;a Gotama, Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, of the sons of the S&agrave;kyas, who went out from the S&agrave;kya clan to adopt the religious life, is now staying at Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a, in the mango grove, on the bank of the river Aciravat&atilde;, to the north of Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a. Now regarding that venerable Gotama, such is the high reputation that has been noised abroad: "That Exalted One is an Arahat, a fully enlightened one, abounding in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher of gods and men, an Exalted One, a Buddha.&ucirc;</P>
<P>[\q&nbsp;302/] Come, then, Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, let us go to the place where the Sama&otilde;a Gotama is; and when we have come there, let us ask the Sama&otilde;a Gotama touching this matter. What the Sama&otilde;a Gotama shall declare unto us, that let us bear in mind. <A NAME="BM7"></A></FONT><A HREF="#n7"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">[7]</FONT></A></P>
<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>`Very well, my friend!' said the young Brahman Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja, in assent, to the young Brahman V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha.</P>
<P>8. Then the young Brahman V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha and the young Brahman Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja went on to the place where the Exalted One was.</P>
<P>And when they had come there, they exchanged with the Exalted One the greetings and compliments of politeness and courtesy, and sat down beside him.</P>
<P>And while they were thus seated the young Brahman V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha said to the Exalted One:</P>
<P>`As we, Gotama, were taking exercise and walking up and down, there sprung up a conversation between us on which was the true path, and which the false. I said thus:</P>

<P>`Now what think you, V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, suppose there were a man born in Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a, and people should ask him, who never till that time had left Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a, which was the way to Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a.

<P>`Certainly not, Gotama! And why? If the man had been born and brought up in Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a, every road that leads to Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a would be perfectly familiar to him.'</P>
<P>38. `That man, V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, born and brought up at Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a might, if he were asked the way to Manas&agrave;ka&ntilde;a, fall into doubt and difficulty, but to the Tath&agrave;gata, when asked touching the path which leads to the world of Brahm&agrave;, there can be neither doubt nor difficulty.

Yea, I know it even as one who has entered the Brahm&agrave;-world, and has been born within it!'</P>
<P>39. When he had thus spoken ,V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, the young Brahman, said to the Blessed One:</P>
<P>`Just so has it been told me, Gotama, even that the Sama&otilde;a Gotama knows the way to a state of union with Brahm&agrave;. It is well!

<P>[\q&nbsp;316/] `So be it, Lord!' said the young Brahman V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, in assent, to the Blessed One.</P>
<P>40. Then the Blessed One spake, and said:</P>
<P>`Know, V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, that (from time to time) a Tath&agrave;gata is born into the world, an Arahat, a fully awakened one, abounding, in wisdom and goodness, happy, with knowledge of the worlds, unsurpassed as a guide to mortals willing to be led, a teacher of gods and men, a Blessed One, a Buddha. He, by himself, thoroughly understands, and sees, as it were, face to face this universe&THORN;including the worlds above with the cods, the M&agrave;ras, and the Brahm&agrave;s; and the world below with its Sama&otilde;as and Brahmans, its princes and peoples;&THORN;and he then makes his knowledge known to others. The truth doth he proclaim both in the letter and in the spirit, lovely in its origin, lovely in its progress, lovely in its consummation: the higher life doth he make known, in all its purity and in all its perfectness.'</P>
<P>41. `A householder (<I>gahapati</I>), or one of his children, or a man of inferior birth in any class, listens to that truth. <A NAME="BM27"></A></FONT><A HREF="#n27"><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">[27]</FONT></A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"> On hearing the truth he has faith in the Tath&agrave;gata, and when he has acquired that faith he thus considers with himself:</P>
<P>&szlig;Full of hindrances is household life, a path defiled by passion: free as the air is the life of him who has renounced all worldly things. How difficult it is for the man who dwells at home to live the higher life in all its fullness, in all its purity, in all its bright perfection! Let me then cut off my hair and beard, let me clothe myself in the orange-coloured robes, and let me go forth from a household life into the homeless state.&ucirc;</P>
<P>`Then before long, forsaking his portion of wealth, be it great or be it small; forsaking his circle of relatives, be they many or be they few, he cuts off his hair and beard, he clothes himself in the orange-coloured [\q&nbsp;317/] robes. and he goes forth from the household life into the homeless state.</P>
<P>42. `When he has thus become a recluse he passes a life self-restrained by that restraint which should be binding on a recluse. Uprightness is his delight, and he sees danger in the least of those things he should avoid. He adopts and trains himself in the precepts. He encompasses himself with goodness in word and deed. He sustains his life by means that are quite pure; good is his conduct, guarded the door of his senses; mindful and self-possessed, he is altogether happy!'</P>
<P>43-75. `And how, V&agrave;se&ntilde;&ntilde;ha, is his conduct good?'</P>
<P>[The answer is set forth in the words of the tract on the S&atilde;las, translated above, pp.</P>
