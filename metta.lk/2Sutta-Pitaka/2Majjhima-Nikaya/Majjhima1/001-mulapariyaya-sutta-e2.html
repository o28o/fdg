<h3>Translator's Introduction</h3>
<p>The Buddha taught that clinging to views is one of the four forms of
clinging that tie the mind to the processes of suffering. He thus
recommended that his followers relinquish their clinging, not only to
views in their full-blown form as specific positions, but also in their
rudimentary form as the categories &amp; relationships that the mind
reads into experience. This is a point he makes in the following
discourse, which is apparently his response to a particular school of
Brahmanical thought that was developing in his time -- the Samkhya, or
classification school. </p>
<p>This school had its beginnings in the thought of Uddalaka, a
ninth-century B.C. philosopher who posited a "root": an abstract
principle out of which all things emanated and which was immanent in
all things. Philosophers who carried on this line of thinking offered a
variety of theories, based on logic and meditative experience, about
the nature of the ultimate root and about the hierarchy of the
emanation. Many of their theories were recorded in the Upanishads and
eventually developed into the classical Samkhya system around the time
of the Buddha. </p>
<p>Although the present discourse says nothing about the background of
the monks listening to it, the Commentary states that before their
ordination they were brahmins, and that even after their ordination
they continued to interpret the Buddha's teachings in light of their
previous training, which may well have been proto-Samkhya. If this is
so, then the Buddha's opening lines -- "I will teach you the sequence
of the root of all phenomena" -- would have them prepared to hear his
contribution to their line of thinking. And, in fact, the list of
topics he covers reads like a Buddhist Samkhya. Paralleling the
classical Samkhya, it contains 24 items, begins with the physical world
(here, the four physical properties), and leads back through ever more
refined &amp; inclusive levels of being &amp; experience, culminating
with the ultimate Buddhist concept: Unbinding (nibbana). In the pattern
of Samkhya thought, Unbinding would thus be the ultimate "root" or
ground of being immanent in all things and out of which they all
emanate. </p>
<p>However, instead of following this pattern of thinking, the Buddha
attacks it at its very root: the notion of a principle in the abstract,
the "in" (immanence) &amp; "out of" (emanation) superimposed on
experience. Only an uninstructed, run of the mill person, he says,
would read experience in this way. In contrast, a person in training
should look for a different kind of "root" -- the root of suffering
experienced in the present -- and find it in the act of delight.
Developing dispassion for that delight, the trainee can then comprehend
the process of coming-into-being for what it is, drop all participation
in it, and thus achieve true awakening. </p>
<p>If the listeners present at this discourse were indeed interested in
fitting Buddhist teachings into a Samkhyan mold, then it's small wonder
that they were displeased -- one of the few places where we read of a
negative reaction to the Buddha's words. They had hoped to hear his
contribution to their project, but instead they hear their whole
pattern of thinking &amp; theorizing attacked as ignorant &amp;
ill-informed. The Commentary tells us, though, they were later able to
overcome their displeasure and eventually attain awakening on listening
to the discourse reported in AN III.126. </p>
<p>Although at present we rarely think in the same terms as the Samkhya
philosophers, there has long been -- and still is -- a common tendency
to create a "Buddhist" metaphysics in which the experience of
emptiness, the Unconditioned, the Dharma-body, Buddha-nature, rigpa,
etc., is said to function as the ground of being from which the "All"
-- the entirety of our sensory &amp; mental experience -- is said to
spring and to which we return when we meditate. Some people think that
these theories are the inventions of scholars without any direct
meditative experience, but actually they have most often originated
among meditators, who label (or in the words of the discourse,
"perceive") a particular meditative experience as the ultimate goal,
identify with it in a subtle way (as when we are told that "we are the
knowing"), and then view that level of experience as the ground of
being out of which all other experience comes. </p>
<p>Any teaching that follows these lines would be subject to the same
criticism that the Buddha directed against the monks who first heard
this discourse. </p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a
 name="ukkattha">Ukkattha</a>, in the shade of a royal Sal tree in the
Very Blessed Grove. There he addressed the monks, "Monks!" </p>
<p>"Yes, lord," the monks responded. </p>
<p>The Blessed One said, "Monks, I will teach you the sequence of the
root of all phenomena [or: the root sequence of all phenomena]. Listen
&amp; pay close attention. I will speak." </p>
<p>"As you say, sir," they responded. </p>
<p>The Blessed One said: "There is the case, monks, where an
uninstructed run-of-the-mill person -- who has no regard for noble
ones, is not well-versed or disciplined in their Dhamma; who has no
regard for men of integrity, is not well-versed or disciplined in their
Dhamma -- perceives earth as earth. Perceiving earth as earth, he
conceives [things] about earth, he conceives [things] in earth, he
conceives [things] coming out of earth, he conceives earth as 'mine,'
he delights in earth. Why is that? Because he has not comprehended it,
I tell you. </p>

Perceiving Unbinding as Unbinding, he conceives things about Unbinding,
he conceives things in Unbinding, he conceives things coming out of
Unbinding, he conceives Unbinding as 'mine,' he delights in Unbinding.
Why is that? Because he has not comprehended it, I tell you. </p>
