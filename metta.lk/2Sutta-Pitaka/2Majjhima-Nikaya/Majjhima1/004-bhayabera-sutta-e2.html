<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near <a
 name="S&agrave;vatthi">S&agrave;vatthi</a> at Jeta's Grove, <a name="anatha">An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika</a>'s
monastery. Then <a name="janussoni">Janussoni</a> the brahmin went to
the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with
him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat
to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One,
"Master Gotama, the sons of good families who have gone forth from the
home life into homelessness out of conviction in Master Gotama: is
Master Gotama their leader? Is Master Gotama their helper? Is Master
Gotama their inspirer? Do they take Master Gotama as their example?" </p>
<p>"Yes, brahmin, so it is. The sons of good families who have gone
forth from the home life into homelessness out of conviction in me: I
am their leader. I am their helper. I am their inspirer. They take me
as their example." </p>
<p>"But, Master Gotama, it's not easy to endure isolated forest or
wilderness dwellings. It's not easy to maintain seclusion, not easy to
enjoy being alone. The forests, as it were, plunder the mind of a monk
who has not attained concentration." </p>
<p>"Yes, brahmin, so it is. It's not easy to endure isolated forest or
wilderness dwellings. It's not easy to maintain seclusion, not easy to
enjoy being alone. The forests, as it were, plunder the mind of a monk
who has not attained concentration. Before my awakening, when I was
still an unawakened Bodhisatta, the thought occurred to me as well:
'It's not easy to maintain seclusion, not easy to enjoy being alone.
The forests, as it were, plunder the mind of a monk who has not
attained concentration.' </p>
<p>"The thought occurred to me: 'When priests or contemplatives who are
unpurified in their bodily activities resort to isolated forest or
wilderness dwellings, it's the fault of their unpurified bodily
activities that they give rise to unskillful fear &amp; terror. But
it's not the case that I am unpurified in my bodily activities when I
resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings. I am purified in my
bodily activities. I am one of those noble ones who are purified in
their bodily activities when they resort to isolated forest or
wilderness dwellings.' Seeing in myself this purity of bodily
activities, I felt even more undaunted about staying in the wilderness.
</p>
<p>"The thought occurred to me: 'When priests or contemplatives who are
unpurified in their verbal activities...unpurified in their mental
activities...unpurified in their livelihood resort to isolated forest
or wilderness dwellings, it's the fault of their unpurified livelihood
that they give rise to unskillful fear &amp; terror. But it's not the
case that I am unpurified in my livelihood when I resort to isolated
forest or wilderness dwellings. I am purified in my livelihood. I am
one of those noble ones who are purified in their livelihood when they
resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings.' Seeing in myself
this purity of livelihood, I felt even more undaunted about staying in
the wilderness. </p>
<p>"The thought occurred to me: 'When priests or contemplatives who are
covetous &amp; fiercely passionate for sensual pleasures...I am not
covetous...'.... </p>
<p>"...'When priests or contemplatives who have minds of ill will, with
destructive attitudes...I have a mind of good will...'.... </p>
<p>"...'When priests or contemplatives who are overcome by torpor &amp;
lethargy...I am devoid of torpor &amp; lethargy...'.... </p>
<p>"...'When priests or contemplatives who are restless &amp; with an
unstill mind...I have a still mind...'.... </p>
<p>"...'When priests or contemplatives who are uncertain &amp;
doubting...I have gone beyond uncertainty...'.... </p>
<p>"...'When priests or contemplatives who are given to praising
themselves &amp; disparaging others...I do not praise myself or
disparage others...'.... </p>
<p>"...'When priests or contemplatives who tend toward panic &amp;
dread...I have gone beyond horripilation...'.... </p>
<p>"...'When priests or contemplatives who are desirous of gains,
offerings, &amp; fame...I have few wants...'.... </p>
<p>"...'When priests or contemplatives who are lazy &amp; lacking in
persistence...My persistence is aroused...'.... </p>
<p>"...'When priests or contemplatives who are muddled in their
mindfulness &amp; unalert...I have mindfulness established...'.... </p>
<p>"...'When priests or contemplatives who are unconcentrated, with
straying minds...I am consummate in concentration...'.... </p>
<p>"The thought occurred to me: 'When priests or contemplatives who are
drooling idiots, resort to isolated forest or wilderness dwellings,
it's the fault of their drooling idiocy that they give rise to
unskillful fear &amp; terror. But it's not the case that I am a
drooling idiot, when I resort to isolated forest or wilderness
dwellings. I am consummate in discernment. I am one of those noble ones
who are consummate in discernment when they resort to isolated forest
or wilderness dwellings.' Seeing in myself this consummate discernment,
I felt even more undaunted about staying in the wilderness. </p>
<p>"<a name="fear">The thought</a> occurred to me: 'What if -- on
recognized, designated nights such as the eighth, fourteenth, &amp;
fifteenth of the lunar fortnight -- I were to stay in the sort of
places that are awe-inspiring and make your hair stand on end, such as
park-shrines, forest-shrines, &amp; tree-shrines? Perhaps I would get
to see that fear &amp; terror.' So at a later time -- on recognized,
designated nights such as the eighth, fourteenth, &amp; fifteenth of
the lunar fortnight -- I stayed in the sort of places that are
awe-inspiring and make your hair stand on end, such as park-shrines,
forest-shrines, &amp; tree-shrines. And while I was staying there a
wild animal would come, or a bird would make a twig fall, or wind would
rustle the fallen leaves. The thought would occur to me: 'Is this that
fear &amp; terror coming?' Then the thought occurred to me: 'Why do I
just keep waiting for fear? What if I were to subdue fear &amp; terror
in whatever state they come?' So when fear &amp; terror came while I
was walking back &amp; forth, I would not stand or sit or lie down. I
would keep walking back &amp; forth until I had subdued that fear &amp;
terror. When fear &amp; terror came while I was standing, I would not
walk or sit or lie down. I would keep standing until I had subdued that
fear &amp; terror. When fear &amp; terror came while I was sitting, I
would not lie down or stand up or walk. I would keep sitting until I
had subdued that fear &amp; terror. When fear &amp; terror came while I
was lying down, I would not sit up or stand or walk. I would keep lying
down until I had subdued that fear &amp; terror. </p>
<p>"There are some priests &amp; contemplatives, brahmin, who have the
perception of 'day' when it is night, and of 'night' when it is day.
This, I tell you, is their being in a dwelling of delusion. As for me,
I have the perception of 'day' when it is day, and of 'night' when it
is night. If anyone, when speaking rightly, were to say, 'A being not
subject to delusion has appeared in the world for the benefit &amp;
happiness of many, out of sympathy for the world, for the welfare,
benefit, &amp; happiness of human &amp; divine beings,' he would
rightly be speaking of me. </p>
<p>"Unflagging persistence was aroused in me, and unmuddled mindfulness
established. My body was calm &amp; unaroused, my mind concentrated
&amp; single. Quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from
unskillful mental qualities, I entered &amp; remained in the first
jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by
directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed
thought &amp; evaluation, I entered &amp; remained in the second jhana:
rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free
from directed thought &amp; evaluation -- internal assurance. With the
fading of rapture I remained in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, and
physically sensitive of pleasure. I entered &amp; remained in the third
jhana, of which the noble ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he
has a pleasurable abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain
-- as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress -- I
entered &amp; remained in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp;
mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. </p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to the <i>knowledge of recollecting my
past lives.</i> I recollected my manifold past lives, i.e., one birth,
two...five, ten...fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand,
many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many
eons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion: 'There I had such a name,
belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such
my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing
away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name,
belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such
my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing
away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus I remembered my manifold
past lives in their modes &amp; details. </p>
<p>"This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed; light arose -- as happens in one who is heedful, ardent,
&amp; resolute. </p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to the <i>knowledge of the passing
away &amp; reappearance of beings.</i> I saw -- by means of the divine
eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human -- beings passing away &amp;
re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior,
beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with
their kamma: 'These beings -- who were endowed with bad conduct of
body, speech &amp; mind, who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and
undertook actions under the influence of wrong views -- with the
break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of
deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these
beings -- who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, &amp;
mind, who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook
actions under the influence of right views -- with the break-up of the
body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the
heavenly world.' Thus -- by means of the divine eye, purified &amp;
surpassing the human -- I saw beings passing away &amp; re-appearing,
and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp;
ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with their kamma. </p>
<p>"This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed; light arose -- as happens in one who is heedful, ardent,
&amp; resolute. </p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to the <i>knowledge of the ending of
the mental fermentations.</i> I discerned, as it was actually present,
that 'This is stress...This is the origination of stress...This is the
cessation of stress...This is the way leading to the cessation of
stress...These are fermentations...This is the origination of
fermentations...This is the cessation of fermentations...This is the
way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' My heart, thus knowing,
thus seeing, was released from the fermentation of sensuality, released
from the fermentation of becoming, released from the fermentation of
ignorance. With release, there was the knowledge, 'Released.' I
discerned that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.
There is nothing further for this world.' </p>
<p>"This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed; light arose -- as happens in one who is heedful, ardent,
&amp; resolute. </p>
<p>"Now, brahmin, if the thought should occur to you, 'Perhaps Gotama
the contemplative is even today not free of passion, not free of
aversion, not free of delusion, which is why he resorts to isolated
forest &amp; wilderness dwellings,' it should not be seen in that way.
It's through seeing two compelling reasons that I resort to isolated
forest &amp; wilderness dwellings: seeing a pleasant abiding for myself
in the present, and feeling sympathy for future generations." </p>
<p>"How truly future generations have been shown sympathy by Master
Gotama in the manner of one who is worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened! <a
 name="magnif">Magnificent</a>, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if
he were to place upright what had been overturned, were to reveal what
was hidden, were to show the way to one who was lost, or were to hold
up a lamp in the dark so that those with eyes could see shapes, in the
same way Master Gotama has -- through many lines of reasoning -- made
the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and
to the Sangha of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower
who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life." </p>
