<p>"Now what is the allure of sensuality? There are, monks, these five
strands of sensuality. Which five? Forms cognizable via the eye --
agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing, fostering desire, enticing.
Sounds cognizable via the ear...Aromas cognizable via the
nose...Flavors cognizable via the tongue...Tactile sensations
cognizable via the body -- agreeable, pleasing, charming, endearing,
fostering desire, enticing. Now whatever pleasure or joy arises in
dependence on these five strands of sensuality, that is the allure of
sensuality.
</p>
<p>"<a name="drawback">And what</a> is the drawback of sensuality?
There is the case where, on account of the occupation by which a
clansman makes a living -- whether checking or accounting or
calculating or plowing or trading or cattle tending or archery or as a
king's man, or whatever the occupation may be -- he faces cold; he
faces heat; being harassed by mosquitoes, flies, wind, sun, and
creeping things; dying from hunger and thirst.
</p>
<p>"Now this drawback in the case of sensuality, this mass of stress
visible here and now, has sensuality for its reason, sensuality for its
source, sensuality for its cause, the reason being simply sensuality.
</p>
<p>"If the clansman gains no wealth while thus working and striving and
making effort, he sorrows, grieves and laments, beats his breast,
becomes distraught: 'My work is in vain, my efforts are fruitless!' Now
this drawback too in the case of sensuality, this mass of stress
visible here and now, has sensuality for its reason...
</p>
<p>"If the clansman gains wealth while thus working and striving and
making effort, he experiences pain and distress in protecting it: 'How
shall neither kings nor thieves make off with my property, nor fire
burn it, nor water sweep it away nor hateful heirs make off with it?'
And as he thus guards and watches over his property, kings or thieves
make off with it, or fire burns it, or water sweeps it away, or hateful
heirs make off with it. And he sorrows, grieves and laments, beats his
breast, becomes distraught: 'What was mine is no more!' Now this
drawback too in the case of sensuality, this mass of stress visible
here and now, has sensuality for its reason...
</p>
<p>"Furthermore, it is with sensuality for the reason, sensuality for
the source, sensuality for the cause, the reason being simply
sensuality, that kings quarrel with kings, nobles with nobles, priests
with priests, householders with householders, mother with child, child
with mother, father with child, child with father, brother with
brother, sister with sister, brother with sister, sister with brother,
friend with friend. And then in their quarrels, brawls, and disputes,
they attack one another with fists or with clods or with sticks or with
knives, so that they incur death or deadly pain. Now this drawback too
in the case of sensuality, this mass of stress visible here and now,
has sensuality for its reason...
</p>
<p>"Furthermore, it is with sensuality for the reason, sensuality for
the source...that (men), taking swords and shields and buckling on bows
and quivers, charge into battle massed in double array while arrows and
spears are flying and swords are flashing; and there they are wounded
by arrows and spears, and their heads are cut off by swords, so that
they incur death or deadly pain. Now this drawback too in the case of
sensuality, this mass of stress visible here and now, has sensuality
for its reason...
</p>
<p>"Furthermore, it is with sensuality for the reason, sensuality for
the source...that (men), taking swords and shields and buckling on bows
and quivers, charge slippery bastions while arrows and spears are
flying and swords are flashing; and there they are splashed with
boiling cow dung and crushed under heavy weights, and their heads are
cut off by swords, so that they incur death or deadly pain. Now this
drawback too in the case of sensuality, this mass of stress visible
here and now, has sensuality for its reason, sensuality for its source,
sensuality for its cause, the reason being simply sensuality.
</p>
<p>"And what is the emancipation from sensuality? Whatever is the
subduing of passion and desire, the abandoning of passion and desire
for sensuality, that is the emancipation from sensuality."
