<h3>Translator's Introduction</h3>
<p>This discourse plays a central role in the early Buddhist analysis
of conflict. As might be expected, the blame for conflict lies within,
in the unskillful habits of the mind, rather than without. The culprit
in this case is a habit called <i>papa&ntilde;ca.</i> Unfortunately,
none of the early texts give a clear definition of what the word
papa&ntilde;ca means, so it's hard to find a precise English equivalent
for the term. However, they do give a clear analysis of how
papa&ntilde;ca arises, how it leads to conflict, and how it can be
ended. In the final analysis, these are the questions that matter --
more than the precise definition of terms -- so we will deal with them
first before proposing a few possible translation equivalents for the
word. </p>
<p>Three passages in the discourses -- DN 21, MN 18, and Sn IV.11 --
map the causal processes that give rise to papa&ntilde;ca and lead from
papa&ntilde;ca to conflict. Because the Buddhist analysis of causality
is generally non-linear, with plenty of room for feedback loops, the
maps vary in some of their details. In DN 21, the map reads like this: </p>
<blockquote>the perceptions &amp; categories of papa&ntilde;ca &gt;
thinking &gt; desire &gt; dear-&amp;-not-dear &gt; envy &amp;
stinginess &gt; rivalry &amp; hostility </blockquote>
<p>In Sn IV.11, the map is less linear and can be diagramed like this: </p>
<blockquote>perception &gt; the categories of papa&ntilde;ca </blockquote>
<blockquote>perception &gt; name &amp; form &gt; contact &gt; appealing
&amp; unappealing &gt; desire &gt; dear-&amp;-not-dear &gt;
stinginess/divisiveness/quarrels/disputes </blockquote>
<p>In MN 18, the map is this: </p>
<blockquote>contact &gt; feeling &gt; perception &gt; thinking &gt; the
perceptions &amp; categories of papa&ntilde;ca </blockquote>
<p>In this last case, however, the bare outline misses some of the
important implications of the way this process is phrased. In the full
passage, the analysis starts out in an impersonal tone: </p>
<blockquote>Dependent on eye &amp; forms, eye-consciousness arises
[similarly with the rest of the six sense]. The meeting of the three is
contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there is feeling. </blockquote>
<p>Starting with feeling, the notion of an "agent" -- in this case, the
feeler -- acting on "objects," is introduced: </p>
<blockquote>What one feels, one perceives (labels in the mind). What
one perceives, one thinks about. What one thinks about, one
"papa&ntilde;cizes". </blockquote>
<p>Through the process of papa&ntilde;ca, the agent then becomes a
victim of his/her own patterns of thinking: </p>
<blockquote>Based on what a person papa&ntilde;cizes, the perceptions
&amp; categories of papa&ntilde;ca assail him/her with regard to past,
present, &amp; future forms cognizable via the eye [as with the
remaining senses]. </blockquote>
<p>What are these perceptions &amp; categories that assail the person
who papa&ntilde;cizes? Sn IV.14 states that the root of the categories
of papa&ntilde;ca is the perception, "I am the thinker." From this
self-reflexive thought -- in which one conceives a "self," a thing
corresponding to the concept of "I" -- a number of categories can be
derived: being/not-being, me/not-me, mine/not-mine, doer/done-to,
signifier/signified. Once one's self becomes a thing under the rubric
of these categories, it's impossible not to be assailed by the
perceptions &amp; categories derived from these basic distinctions.
When there's the sense of identification with something that
experiences, then based on the feelings arising from sensory contact,
some feelings will seem appealing -- worth getting for the self -- and
others will seem unappealing -- worth pushing away. From this there
grows desire, which comes into conflict with the desires of others who
are also engaging in papa&ntilde;ca. This is how inner complications
breed external contention. </p>
<p>How can this process be ended? Through a shift in perception, caused
by the way one attends to feelings, using the categories of appropriate
attention [see MN 2]. As the Buddha states in DN 21, rather than
viewing a feeling as an appealing or unappealing thing, one should look
at it as part of a causal process: when a particular feeling is
pursued, do skillful or unskillful qualities increase in the mind? If
skillful qualities increase, the feeling may be pursued. If unskillful
qualities increase, it shouldn't. When comparing feelings that lead to
skillful qualities, notice which are more refined: those free of
thinking (directed thought) and evaluation, as in the higher stages of
mental absorption, or jhana. When seeing this, there is a tendency to
opt for the more refined feelings, and this cuts through the act of
thinking that, according to MN 18, provides the basis for
papa&ntilde;ca. </p>
<p>In following this program, the notion of agent and victim is
avoided, as is self-reflexive thinking in general. There is simply the
analysis of cause-effect processes. One is still making use of
dualities -- distinguishing between unskillful and skillful (and
affliction/lack of affliction, the results of unskillful and skillful
qualities) -- but the distinction is between processes, not things.
Thus one's analysis avoids the type of thinking that, according to DN
21, depends on the perceptions and categories of papa&ntilde;ca, and in
this way the vicious cycle by which thinking and papa&ntilde;ca keep
feeding each other is cut. </p>
<p>Ultimately, by following this program to greater and greater levels
of refinement through the higher levels of mental absorption, one finds
less and less to relish and enjoy in the six senses and the mental
processes based on them. With this sense of disenchantment, the
processes of feeling and thought are stilled, and there is a
breakthrough to the cessation of the six sense spheres. When these
spheres cease, is there anything else left? Ven. S&agrave;riputta, in
AN IV.173, warns us not to ask, for to ask if there is, isn't,
both-is-and-isn't, neither-is-nor-isn't anything left in that sphere is
to papa&ntilde;cize what is free from papa&ntilde;ca. However, this
sphere is not a total annihilation of experience. It's a type of
experience that DN 11 calls consciousness without feature, luminous all
around, where water, earth, fire, &amp; wind have no footing, where
long/short, coarse/fine, fair/foul, name/form are all brought to an
end. This is the fruit of the path of arahantship -- a path that makes
use of dualities but leads to a fruit beyond them. </p>
<p>It may come as cold comfort to realize that conflict can be totally
overcome only with the realization of arahantship, but it's important
to note that by following the path recommended in DN 21 -- learning to
avoid references to any notion of "self" and learning to view feelings
not as things but as parts of a causal process affecting the qualities
in the mind -- the basis for papa&ntilde;ca is gradually undercut, and
there are fewer and fewer occasions for conflict. In following this
path, one reaps its increasing benefits all along the way. </p>
<b></b>
<p><b>Translating papa&ntilde;ca:</b> As one writer has noted, the word
papa&ntilde;ca has had a wide variety of meanings in Indian thought,
with only one constant: in Buddhist philosophical discourse it carries
negative connotations, usually of falsification and distortion. The
word itself is derived from a root that means diffuseness, spreading,
proliferating. The Pali Commentaries define papa&ntilde;ca as covering
three types of thought: craving, conceit, and views. They also note
that it functions to slow the mind down in its escape from samsara.
And, as our analysis has shown, it functions to create baneful
distinctions and unnecessary issues. For these reasons, I have chosen
to render the word as "complication," although some of the following
alternatives might be acceptable as well: self-reflexive thinking,
reification, proliferation, exaggeration, elaboration, distortion. </p>
<p></p>
<hr>
<p></p>
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was living among
the <a name="sakyan">Sakyans</a> near <a name="kapilavatthu">Kapilavatthu</a>
in the Banyan Park. Then in the early morning, having put on his robes
and carrying his bowl &amp; outer robe, he went into Kapilavatthu for
alms. Having gone for alms in Kapilavatthu, after the meal, returning
from his alms round, he went to the Great Wood for the day's abiding.
Plunging into the Great Wood, he sat down at the root of a bilva
sapling for the day's abiding. </p>
<p><a name="dandapani">Dandapani</a> ("Stick-in-hand") the Sakyan, out
roaming &amp; rambling for exercise, also went to the Great Wood.
Plunging into the Great Wood, he went to where the Blessed One was
under the bilva sapling. On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings
with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he
stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to the Blessed
One, "What is the contemplative's doctrine? What does he proclaim?" </p>
<p>"The sort of doctrine, friend, where one does not keep quarreling
with anyone in the cosmos with its deities, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, with
its contemplatives &amp; priests, its royalty &amp; commonfolk; the
sort [of doctrine] where perceptions no longer lie latent in the
brahmin who remains dissociated from sensual pleasures, free from
perplexity, his uncertainty cut away, devoid of craving for becoming
&amp; non-. Such is my doctrine, such is what I proclaim." </p>
<p>When this was said, Dandapani the Sakyan -- shaking his head,
wagging his tongue, raising his eyebrows so that his forehead was
wrinkled in three furrows -- left, leaning on his stick. </p>
<p>Then, when it was evening, the Blessed One rose from his seclusion
and went to the Banyan Park. On arrival, he sat down on a seat made
ready. As he was sitting there, he [told the monks what had happened].
When this was said, a certain monk said to the Blessed One, "Lord, what
sort of doctrine is it where one does not keep quarreling with anyone
in the cosmos with its deities, Maras, &amp; Brahmas, with its
contemplatives &amp; priests, its royalty &amp; commonfolk; where
perceptions no longer lie latent in the brahmin who remains dissociated
from sensual pleasures, free from perplexity, his uncertainty cut away,
devoid of craving for becoming &amp; non-?" </p>
<p>"If, monk, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions &amp;
categories of complication assail a person, there is nothing there to
relish, welcome, or remain fastened to, then that is the end of the
underlying tendencies to passion, to irritation, to views, to
uncertainty, to conceit, to passion for becoming, &amp; to ignorance.
That is the end of taking up rods &amp; bladed weapons, of arguments,
quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive tale-bearing, &amp; false
speech. That is where these evil, unskillful things cease without
remainder." That is what the Blessed One said. Having said it, the One
Well-gone got up from his seat and went into his dwelling. </p>
<p>Then, not long after the Blessed One had left, this thought occurred
to the monks: "This brief statement the Blessed One made, after which
he went into his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning --
i.e., 'If, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions &amp;
categories of complication assail a person, there is nothing to relish
... that is where these evil, unskillful things cease without
remainder': now who might analyze the unanalyzed detailed meaning of
this brief statement?" Then the thought occurred to them, "<a
 name="kaccayana">Ven. Maha Kaccayana</a> is praised by the Teacher and
esteemed by his knowledgeable companions in the holy life. He is
capable of analyzing the unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief
statement. Suppose we were to go to him and, on arrival, question him
about this matter." </p>
<p>So the monks went to Ven. Maha Kaccayana and, on arrival exchanged
courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings
&amp; courtesies, they sat to one side. As they were sitting there,
they [told him what had happened, and added,] "Analyze the meaning,
Ven. Maha Kaccayana!" </p>
<p>[He replied:] "Friends, <a name="heartwood">it's as if</a> a man
needing heartwood, looking for heartwood, wandering in search of
heartwood -- passing over the root &amp; trunk of a standing tree
possessing heartwood -- were to imagine that heartwood should be sought
among its branches &amp; leaves. So it is with you, who -- having
bypassed the Blessed One when you were face to face with him, the
Teacher -- imagine that I should be asked about this matter. For
knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he sees. He is the Eye, he is
Knowledge, he is Dhamma, he is Brahma. He is the speaker, the
proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, the giver of the Deathless, the
lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata. That was the time when you should
have questioned him about this matter. However he answered, that was
how you should have remembered it." </p>
<p>"Yes, friend Kaccayana: knowing, the Blessed One knows; seeing, he
sees. He is the Eye, he is Knowledge, he is Dhamma, he is Brahma. He is
the speaker, the proclaimer, the elucidator of meaning, <a name="giver">the
giver of the Deathless</a>, the lord of the Dhamma, the Tathagata. That
was the time when we should have questioned him about this matter.
However he answered, that was how we should have remembered it. But you
are praised by the Teacher and esteemed by your knowledgeable
companions in the holy life. You are capable of analyzing the
unanalyzed detailed meaning of this brief statement. Analyze the
meaning, Ven. Maha Kaccayana!" </p>
<p>"In that case, my friends, listen &amp; pay close attention. I will
speak." </p>
<p>"As you say, friend," the monks responded. </p>
<p>Ven. Maha Kaccayana said this: "Concerning the brief statement the
Blessed One made, after which he went into his dwelling without
analyzing the detailed meaning -- i.e., 'If, with regard to the cause
whereby the perceptions &amp; categories of complication assail a

becoming, &amp; to ignorance. That is the end of taking up rods &amp;
bladed weapons, of arguments, quarrels, disputes, accusations, divisive
tale-bearing, &amp; false speech. That is where these evil, unskillful
things cease without remainder' -- I understand the detailed meaning to
be this: </p>
<p>"Dependent on eye &amp; forms, eye-consciousness arises. The meeting
of the three is contact. With contact as a requisite condition, there
is feeling. What one feels, one perceives (labels in the mind). What

<p>"Now, when there is no eye, when there are no forms, when there is

<p>"So, concerning the brief statement the Blessed One made, after
which he entered his dwelling without analyzing the detailed meaning --
i.e., 'If, with regard to the cause whereby the perceptions &amp;

That is the end of taking up rods &amp; bladed weapons, of arguments,

speech. That is where these evil, unskillful things cease without
remainder' -- this is how I understand the detailed meaning. Now, if
you wish, having gone to the Blessed One, question him about this
matter. However he answers is how you should remember it." </p>
<p>Then the monks, delighting &amp; approving of Ven. Maha Kaccayana's
words, rose from their seats and went to the Blessed One. On arrival,
having bowed down to him, they sat to one side. As they were sitting
there, they [told him what had happened after he had gone into his
dwelling, and ended by saying,] "Then Ven. Maha Kaccayana analyzed the
meaning using these words, statements, &amp; phrases." </p>
<p>"Maha Kaccayana is wise, monks. He is a person of great discernment.
If you had asked me about this matter, I too would have answered in the
same way he did. That is the meaning of this statement. That is how you
should remember it." </p>
<p>When this was said, <a name="ananda">Ven. &acirc;nanda</a> said to
the Blessed One, "<a name="honey">Lord</a>, it's as if a man --
overcome with hunger, weakness, &amp; thirst -- were to come across a
ball of honey. Wherever he were to taste it, he would experience a
sweet, delectable flavor. In the same way, wherever a monk of capable
awareness might investigate the meaning of this Dhamma discourse with
his discernment, he would experience gratification, he would experience
confidence. What is the name of this Dhamma discourse?" </p>
<p>"Then, &acirc;nanda, you can remember this Dhamma discourse as the
'Ball of Honey Discourse.'" </p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, Ven. &acirc;nanda
delighted in the Blessed One's words. </p>
