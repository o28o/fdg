<hr>
<p></p>
<p>I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying at <a
 name="S&agrave;vatthi">S&agrave;vatthi</a>, in Jeta's Grove, <a
 name="An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika">An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika</a>'s
monastery. There he addressed the monks: "Monks!" </p>
<p>"Yes, lord," the monks replied. </p>
<p>The Blessed One said, "Monks, before my self-awakening, when I was
still just an unawakened Bodhisatta, the thought occurred to me: 'Why
don't I keep dividing my thinking into two sorts?' So I made thinking
imbued with sensuality, thinking imbued with ill will, &amp; thinking
imbued with harmfulness one sort, and thinking imbued with
renunciation, thinking imbued with non-ill will, &amp; thinking imbued
with harmlessness another sort. </p>
<p>"And as I remained thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, thinking
imbued with sensuality arose. I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with
sensuality has arisen in me; and that leads to my own affliction or to
the affliction of others or to the affliction of both. It obstructs
discernment, promotes vexation, &amp; does not lead to Unbinding.' </p>
<p>"As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction, it subsided. As I
noticed that it leads to the affliction of others...to the affliction
of both...it obstructs discernment, promotes vexation, &amp; does not
lead to Unbinding, it subsided. Whenever thinking imbued with
sensuality had arisen, I simply abandoned it, destroyed it, dispelled
it, wiped it out of existence. </p>
<p>"And as I remained thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, thinking
imbued with ill will arose. I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with ill
will has arisen in me; and that leads to my own affliction or to the
affliction of others or to the affliction of both. It obstructs
discernment, promotes vexation, &amp; does not lead to Unbinding.' </p>
<p>"As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction, it subsided. As I
noticed that it leads to the affliction of others...to the affliction
of both...it obstructs discernment, promotes vexation, &amp; does not
lead to Unbinding, it subsided. Whenever thinking imbued with ill will
had arisen, I simply abandoned it, destroyed it, dispelled it, wiped it
out of existence. </p>
<p>"And as I remained thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, thinking
imbued with harmfulness arose. I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with
harmfulness has arisen in me; and that leads to my own affliction or to
the affliction of others or to the affliction of both. It obstructs
discernment, promotes vexation, &amp; does not lead to Unbinding.' </p>
<p>"As I noticed that it leads to my own affliction, it subsided. As I
noticed that it leads to the affliction of others...to the affliction
of both...it obstructs discernment, promotes vexation, &amp; does not
lead to Unbinding, it subsided. Whenever thinking imbued with
harmfulness had arisen, I simply abandoned it, destroyed it, dispelled
it, wiped it out of existence. </p>
<p>"<a name="habit">Whatever a</a> monk keeps pursuing with his
thinking &amp; pondering, that becomes the inclination of his
awareness. If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with sensuality,
abandoning thinking imbued with renunciation, his mind is bent by that
thinking imbued with sensuality. If a monk keeps pursuing thinking
imbued with ill will, abandoning thinking imbued with non-ill will, his
mind is bent by that thinking imbued with ill will. If a monk keeps
pursuing thinking imbued with harmfulness, abandoning thinking imbued
with harmlessness, his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with
harmfulness. </p>
<p>"<a name="cowherd1">Just as</a> in the last month of the Rains, in
the autumn season when the crops are ripening, a cowherd would look
after his cows: He would tap &amp; poke &amp; check &amp; curb them
with a stick on this side &amp; that. Why is that? Because he foresees
flogging or imprisonment or a fine or public censure arising from that
[if he let his cows wander into the crops]. In the same way I foresaw
in unskillful qualities drawbacks, degradation, &amp; defilement, and I
foresaw in skillful qualities rewards related to renunciation &amp;
promoting cleansing. </p>
<p>"And as I remained thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, thinking
imbued with renunciation arose. I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with
renunciation has arisen in me; and that leads neither to my own
affliction, nor to the affliction of others, nor to the affliction of
both. It fosters discernment, promotes lack of vexation, &amp; leads to
Unbinding. If I were to think &amp; ponder in line with that even for a
night...even for a day...even for a day &amp; night, I do not envision
any danger that would come from it, except that thinking &amp;
pondering a long time would tire the body. When the body is tired, the
mind is disturbed; and a disturbed mind is far from concentration.' So
I steadied my mind right within, settled, unified, &amp; concentrated
it. Why is that? So that my mind would not be disturbed. </p>
<p>"And as I remained thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, thinking
imbued with non-ill will arose. I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with
non-ill will has arisen in me; and that leads neither to my own
affliction, nor to the affliction of others, nor to the affliction of
both. It fosters discernment, promotes lack of vexation, &amp; leads to
Unbinding. If I were to think &amp; ponder in line with that even for a
night...even for a day...even for a day &amp; night, I do not envision

mind is disturbed; and a disturbed mind is far from concentration.' So
I steadied my mind right within, settled, unified, &amp; concentrated
it. Why is that? So that my mind would not be disturbed. </p>
<p>"And as I remained thus heedful, ardent, &amp; resolute, thinking
imbued with harmlessness arose. I discerned that 'Thinking imbued with
harmlessness has arisen in me; and that leads neither to my own
affliction, nor to the affliction of others, nor to the affliction of

<p>"Whatever a monk keeps pursuing with his thinking &amp; pondering,
that becomes the inclination of his awareness. If a monk keeps pursuing
thinking imbued with renunciation, abandoning thinking imbued with
sensuality, his mind is bent by that thinking imbued with renunciation.
If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with non-ill will, abandoning
thinking imbued with ill will, his mind is bent by that thinking imbued
with non-ill will. If a monk keeps pursuing thinking imbued with
harmlessness, abandoning thinking imbued with harmfulness, his mind is
bent by that thinking imbued with harmlessness. </p>
<p>"<a name="cowherd2">Just as</a> in the last month of the hot season,
when all the crops have been gathered into the village, a cowherd would
look after his cows: While resting under the shade of a tree or out in
the open, he simply keeps himself mindful of 'those cows.' In the same
way, I simply kept myself mindful of 'those mental qualities.' </p>
<p>"Unflagging persistence was aroused in me, and unmuddled mindfulness
established. My body was calm &amp; unaroused, my mind concentrated
&amp; single. Quite withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from
unskillful mental qualities, I entered &amp; remained in the first
jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born from withdrawal, accompanied by
directed thought &amp; evaluation. With the stilling of directed
thought &amp; evaluation, I entered &amp; remained in the second jhana:
rapture &amp; pleasure born of composure, unification of awareness free
from directed thought &amp; evaluation -- internal assurance. With the
fading of rapture I remained in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, and
physically sensitive of pleasure. I entered &amp; remained in the third
jhana, of which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he
has a pleasurable abiding.' With the abandoning of pleasure &amp; pain
-- as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress -- I
entered &amp; remained in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity &amp;
mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. </p>
<p><a name="tevijja">"When</a> the mind was thus concentrated,
purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable,
steady, &amp; attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the <i>knowledge
of recollecting my past lives.</i> I recollected my manifold past
lives, i.e., one birth, two...five, ten...fifty, a hundred, a thousand,
a hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of
cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion:
'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an
appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp;
pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose
there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such
an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure &amp;
pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose
here.' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes &amp;
details. </p>
<p>"This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed; light arose -- as happens in one who is heedful, ardent,
&amp; resolute. </p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to the <i>knowledge of the passing
away &amp; reappearance of beings.</i> I saw -- by means of the divine
eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human -- beings passing away &amp;
re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior,
beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with
their kamma: 'These beings -- who were endowed with bad conduct of
body, speech &amp; mind, who reviled the Noble Ones, held wrong views
and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views -- with the
break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of
deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in <a name="hell">hell</a>.
But these beings -- who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech,
&amp; mind, who did not revile the Noble Ones, who held right views and
undertook actions under the influence of right views -- with the
break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good
destinations, in the <a name="heaven">heavenly world</a>.' Thus -- by
means of the divine eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human -- I saw
beings passing away &amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are
inferior &amp; superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp;
unfortunate in accordance with their kamma. </p>
<p>"This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed; light arose -- as happens in one who is heedful, ardent,
&amp; resolute. </p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to the <i>knowledge of the ending of
the mental fermentations.</i> I discerned, as it was actually present,
that 'This is stress...This is the origination of stress...This is the
cessation of stress...This is the way leading to the cessation of
stress...These are fermentations...This is the origination of
fermentations...This is the cessation of fermentations...This is the
way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' My heart, thus knowing,
thus seeing, was released from the fermentation of sensuality, released
from the fermentation of becoming, released from the fermentation of
ignorance. With release, there was the knowledge, 'Released.' I
discerned that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.
There is nothing further for this world.' </p>
<p>"This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed; light arose -- as happens in one who is heedful, ardent,
&amp; resolute. </p>
<p>"<a name="false">Suppose, monks</a>, that in a forested wilderness
there were a large low-lying marsh, in dependence on which there lived
a large herd of deer; and a certain man were to appear, not desiring
their benefit, not desiring their welfare, not desiring their rest from
bondage. He would close off the safe, restful path that led to their
rapture, and would open up a false path, set out a male decoy, place a
female decoy, and thus the large herd of deer, at a later time, would
fall into ruin &amp; disaster. Then suppose that a certain man were to
appear to that same large herd of deer, desiring their benefit,
desiring their welfare, desiring their rest from bondage. He would open
up the safe, restful path that led to their rapture, would close off
the false path, take away the male decoy, destroy the female decoy, and
thus the large herd of deer, at a later time, would come into growth,
increase, &amp; abundance. </p>
<p>"I have given this simile in order to convey a meaning. The meaning
is this: 'The large, low-lying marsh' is a term for sensual pleasures.
'The large herd of deer' is a term for beings. 'The man not desiring
their benefit, not desiring their welfare, not desiring their rest from
bondage' is a term for Mara, the Evil One. 'The false path' is a term
for the eightfold wrong path, i.e., wrong view, wrong resolve, wrong
speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong
mindfulness, &amp; wrong concentration. 'The male decoy' is a term for
passion &amp; delight. 'The female decoy' is a term for ignorance. 'The
man desiring their benefit, desiring their welfare, desiring their rest
from bondage' is a term for the Tathagata, the Worthy One, the Rightly
Self-awakened One. 'The safe, restful path that led to their rapture'
is a term for the noble eightfold path, i.e., right view, right
resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort,
right mindfulness, &amp; right concentration. </p>
<p>"So, monks, I have opened up the safe, restful path, closed off the
false path, removed the male decoy, destroyed the female. Whatever a
teacher should do -- seeking the welfare of his disciples, out of
sympathy for them -- that have I done for you. Over there are the roots
of trees; over there, empty dwellings. Practice jhana, monks. Don't be
heedless. Don't later fall into regret. This is our message to you." </p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in
the Blessed One's words. </p>
