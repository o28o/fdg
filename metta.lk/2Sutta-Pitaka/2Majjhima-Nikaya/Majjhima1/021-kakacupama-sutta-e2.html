<p>... </p>
<p>"Once, monks, in this same <a name="S&agrave;vatthi">S&agrave;vatthi</a>,
there was a lady of a household named <a name="vedehika">Vedehika</a>.
This good report about Lady Vedehika had circulated: 'Lady Vedehika is
gentle. Lady Vedehika is even-tempered. Lady Vedehika is calm.' Now,
Lady Vedehika had a slave named <a name="kali">Kali</a> who was
diligent, deft, &amp; neat in her work. The thought occurred to Kali
the slave: 'This good report about my Lady Vedehika has circulated:
"Lady Vedehika is even-tempered. Lady Vedehika is gentle. Lady Vedehika
is calm." Now, is anger present in my lady without showing, or is it
absent? Or is it just because I'm diligent, deft, &amp; neat in my work
that the anger present in my lady doesn't show? Why don't I test her?' </p>
<p>"So Kali the slave got up after daybreak. Then Lady Vedehika said to
her: 'Hey, Kali!' </p>
<p>"'Yes, madam?' </p>
<p>"'Why did you get up after daybreak?' </p>
<p>"'No reason, madam.' </p>
<p>"'No reason, you wicked slave, and yet you get up after daybreak?'
Angered &amp; displeased, she scowled. </p>
<p>"Then the thought occurred to Kali the slave: 'Anger <i>is</i>
present in my lady without showing, and not absent. And it's just
because I'm diligent, deft, &amp; neat in my work that the anger
present in my lady doesn't show. Why don't I test her some more?' </p>
<p>"So Kali the slave got up later in the day. Then Lady Vedehika said
to her: 'Hey, Kali!' </p>
<p>"'Yes, madam?' </p>
<p>"'Why did you get up later in the day?' </p>
<p>"'No reason, madam.' </p>
<p>"'No reason, you wicked slave, and yet you get up later in the day?'
Angered &amp; displeased, she grumbled. </p>
<p>"Then the thought occurred to Kali the slave: 'Anger <i>is</i>
present in my lady without showing, and not absent. And it's just
because I'm diligent, deft, &amp; neat in my work that the anger
present in my lady doesn't show. Why don't I test her some more?' </p>
<p>"So Kali the slave got up even later in the day. Then Lady Vedehika
said to her: 'Hey, Kali!' </p>
<p>"'Yes, madam?' </p>
<p>"'Why did you get up even later in the day?' </p>
<p>"'No reason, madam.' </p>
<p>"'No reason, you wicked slave, and yet you get up even later in the
day?' Angered &amp; displeased, she grabbed hold of a rolling pin and
gave her a whack over the head, cutting it open. </p>
<p>"Then Kali the slave, with blood streaming from her cut-open head,
went and denounced her mistress to the neighbors: 'See, ladies, the
gentle one's handiwork? See the even-tempered one's handiwork? See the
calm one's handiwork? How could she, angered &amp; displeased with her
only slave for getting up after daybreak, grab hold of a rolling pin
and give her a whack over the head, cutting it open?' </p>
<p>"After that this evil report about Lady Vedehika circulated: 'Lady
Vedehika is vicious. Lady Vedehika is foul-tempered. Lady Vedehika is
violent.' </p>
<p>"<a name="admonish">In the</a> same way, monks, a monk may be ever
so gentle, ever so even-tempered, ever so calm, as long as he is not
touched by disagreeable aspects of speech. But it is only when
disagreeable aspects of speech touch him that he can truly be known as
gentle, even-tempered, &amp; calm. I don't call a monk easy to admonish
if he is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish only by
reason of robes, almsfood, lodging, &amp; medicinal requisites for
curing the sick. Why is that? Because if he doesn't get robes,
almsfood, lodging, &amp; medicinal requisites for curing the sick, then
he isn't easy to admonish and doesn't make himself easy to admonish.
But if a monk is easy to admonish and makes himself easy to admonish
purely out of esteem for the Dhamma, respect for the Dhamma, reverence
for the Dhamma, then I call him easy to admonish. Thus, monks, you
should train yourselves: 'We will be easy to admonish and make
ourselves easy to admonish purely out of esteem for the Dhamma, respect
for the Dhamma, reverence for the Dhamma.' That's how you should train
yourselves. </p>
<p>"Monks, there are these <a name="BM5speech">five aspects</a> of
speech by which others may address you: timely or untimely, true or
false, affectionate or harsh, beneficial or unbeneficial, with a mind
of good-will or with inner hate. Others may address you in a timely way
or an untimely way. They may address you with what is true or what is
false. They may address you in an affectionate way or a harsh way. They
may address you in a beneficial way or an unbeneficial way. They may
address you with a mind of good-will or with inner hate. In any event,
you should train yourselves: 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will
say no evil words. We will remain sympathetic to that person's welfare,
with a mind of good will, and with no inner hate. We will keep
pervading him with an awareness imbued with good will and, beginning
with him, we will keep pervading the all-encompassing world with an
awareness imbued with good will -- abundant, expansive, immeasurable,
free from hostility, free from ill will.' That's how you should train
yourselves. </p>
<p>"<a name="digging">Suppose that</a> a man were to come along
carrying a hoe &amp; a basket, saying, 'I will make this great earth be
without earth.' He would dig here &amp; there, scatter soil here &amp;
there, spit here &amp; there, urinate here &amp; there, saying, 'Be
without earth. Be without earth.' Now, what do you think -- would he
make this great earth be without earth?" </p>
<p>"No, lord. Why is that? Because this great earth is deep &amp;
enormous. It can't easily be made to be without earth. The man would
reap only a share of weariness &amp; disappointment." </p>
<p>"In the same way, monks, there are these five aspects of speech by
which others may address you: timely or untimely, true or false,
affectionate or harsh, beneficial or unbeneficial, with a mind of
good-will or with inner hate. Others may address you in a timely way or
an untimely way. They may address you with what is true or what is
false. They may address you in an affectionate way or a harsh way. They
may address you in a beneficial way or an unbeneficial way. They may
address you with a mind of good-will or with inner hate. In any event,
you should train yourselves: 'Our minds will be unaffected and we will
say no evil words. We will remain sympathetic to that person's welfare,
with a mind of good will, and with no inner hate. We will keep
pervading him with an awareness imbued with good will and, beginning
with him, we will keep pervading the all-encompassing world with an
awareness imbued with good will equal to the great earth -- abundant,
expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.'
That's how you should train yourselves. </p>
<p>"<a name="drawing">Suppose that</a> a man were to come along
carrying lac, yellow orpiment, indigo, or crimson, saying, 'I will draw
pictures in space, I will make pictures appear.' Now, what do you think
-- would he draw pictures in space &amp; make pictures appear?" </p>
<p>"No, lord. Why is that? Because space is formless &amp; featureless.
It's not easy to draw pictures there and to make them appear. The man
would reap only a share of weariness &amp; disappointment." </p>
<p>"In the same way, monks, there are these five aspects of speech by
which others may address you: timely or untimely, true or false,

good-will or with inner hate. Others may address you in a timely way or

should train yourselves. </p>
<p>"<a name="boiling">Suppose that</a> a man were to come along
carrying a burning grass torch and saying, 'With this burning grass
torch I will heat up the river <a name="ganges">Ganges</a> and make it
boil.' Now, what do you think -- would he, with that burning grass
torch, heat up the river Ganges and make it boil?" </p>
<p>"No, lord. Why is that? Because the river Ganges is deep &amp;
enormous. It's not easy to heat it up and make it boil with a burning
grass torch. The man would reap only a share of weariness &amp;
disappointment." </p>
<p>"In the same way, monks, there are these five aspects of speech by

<p>"<a name="bag">Suppose there</a> were a catskin bag -- beaten,
well-beaten, beaten through &amp; through, soft, silky, free of
rustling &amp; crackling -- and a man were to come along carrying a
stick or shard and saying, 'With this stick or shard I will take this
catskin bag -- beaten, well-beaten, beaten through &amp; through, soft,
silky, free of rustling &amp; crackling -- and I will make it rustle
&amp; crackle.' Now, what do you think -- would he, with that stick or
shard, take that catskin bag -- beaten, well-beaten, beaten through
&amp; through, soft, silky, free of rustling &amp; crackling -- and
make it rustle &amp; crackle?" </p>
<p>"No, lord. Why is that? Because the catskin bag is beaten,
well-beaten, beaten through &amp; through, soft, silky, free of
rustling &amp; crackling. It's not easy to make it rustle &amp; crackle
with a stick or shard. The man would reap only a share of weariness
&amp; disappointment." </p>

awareness imbued with good will equal to a catskin bag -- abundant,
expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility, free from ill will.'
That's how you should train yourselves. </p>
<p>"Monks, <a name="saw">even if</a> bandits were to carve you up
savagely, limb by limb, with a two-handled saw, he among you who let
his heart get angered even at that would not be doing my bidding. Even
then you should train yourselves: 'Our minds will be unaffected and we
will say no evil words. We will remain sympathetic, with a mind of good
will, and with no inner hate. We will keep pervading these people with
an awareness imbued with good will and, beginning with them, we will
keep pervading the all-encompassing world with an awareness imbued with
good will -- abundant, expansive, immeasurable, free from hostility,
free from ill will.' That's how you should train yourselves. </p>
<p>"Monks, if you attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of
the saw, do you see any aspects of speech, slight or gross, that you
could not endure?" </p>
<p>"No, lord." </p>
<p>"Then attend constantly to this admonition on the simile of the saw.
That will be for your long-term welfare &amp; happiness." </p>
<p>That is what the Blessed One said. Gratified, the monks delighted in
the Blessed One's words. </p>
