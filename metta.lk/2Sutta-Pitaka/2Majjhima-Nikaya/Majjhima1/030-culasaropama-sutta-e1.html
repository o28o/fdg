Simile of the Heartwood</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">I heard thus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">At one time the Blessed One was
living in the monastery offered by
An&agrave;thapi&iuml;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in
S&agrave;vatthi. Then the brahmin Ping&agrave;lakoccha
approached the Blessed One exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a
side. Seated, the brahmin said to the Blessed One: Good Gotama, these
recluses and brahmins, with followers and teachers of followers are
famous ford makers They are the highly considered Pur&agrave;na
Kassapa, Makkhali Gos&agrave;la, Ajita Kesakambali, Pakudha
Kacc&agrave;yana, Sa&curren;&curren;jaya
Bela&ntilde;&ntilde;haputta and Nigan&ntilde;ha
N&agrave;taputta. Venerable sir, did they all realise their view
completely or didn't they. Or is it that some realised and some did not
realise? Brahmin, whether they all realised their view completely or
did not realise their view completely, or some realised and some did
not realise, leave it alone. I will teach it listen carefully and
attentively. The brahmin Ping&agrave;lakoccha agreed and the
Blessed One said:</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Brahmin, like a man wandering in
search of heartwood, would come to a standing huge tree with heartwood
and he would ignore, the heartwood, sapwood, bark and shoots and would
cut the branches and leaves, and go away with it thinking it is the
heartwood. A wise man seeing him would say, this good man does not know
the heartwood, sapwood, bark, shoots, branches and leaves. He wandering
in search of heartwood, come to a huge standing tree with heartwood
ignoring the heartwood, sapwood, bark and shoots, has cut the branches
and leaves and is carrying them away thinking it is heartwood. The
purpose for which he sought heartwood will not be served.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Brahmin, a certain person leaving
his household would go forth as a homeless, out of faith thinking I am
submerged in birth, decay, death, grief lament unpleasantness and
distress. It is only a few that declare the complete ending of
unpleasanatness. Gone forth thus, he is reborn in gain, honour and
fame. Satisfied with it and his desires fulfilled, he would praise
himself and disparages others. I am a gainer of hospitality, these
other bhikkhus are impotent and not wise. He does not arouse interest
or effort to realise something more exalted than gain, honour and fame
and abides infatuated and lethargic.</font></p>

Not infatuated nor lethargic takes upon himself the endowment of

<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Brahmin, what thing is more noble
and exalted than knowledges and vision. Here brahmin, the bhikkhu,
secluded from sensual desires and secluded from demerit, with thoughts
and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion
attained to abides in the first jh&agrave;na. Brahmin, this thing
is more noble and exalted than knowledges and vision</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again, brahmin, the bhikkhu
overcoming thoughts and thought processes, the self internally
appeased, the mind in one point, with joy and pleasantness born of
concentration attained to abides in the second jh&agrave;na.
Brahmin, this thing is more noble and exalted than knowledges and
vision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again, brahmin, the bhikkhu with
equanimity to joy and detachment abides mindful and aware, experiencing
pleasantness with the body, attained to the third jh&agrave;na. The
noble ones call this, abiding mindfully in pleasantness . with
equanimity. This thing is more noble and exalted than knowledges and
vision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again, brahmin, the bhikkhu
dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, earlier having dispelled
pleasure and displeasure, without unpleasantness and pleasantness and
with mindfulness purified with equanimity, attained to abides in the
fourth jh&agrave;na. Brahmin, this thing is more noble and exalted
than knowledges and vision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again, brahmin, overcoming all
perceptions of matter and all perceptions of anger not attending to
various perceptions, with space is boundless attained to abides in the
sphere of space. Brahmin, this too is more noble and exalted than
knowledges and vision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again, brahmin, the bhikkhu
overcoming all the sphere of space, with consciousness is boundless
attained to abides in the sphere of consciousness. Brahmin, this too is
more noble and exalted than knowledges and vision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again the bhikikhu overcoming all
the sphere of consciousness, with there is no-thing attained to abides
in the sphere of no-thingness. Brahmin, this too is more noble and
exalted than knoweldges and vision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again the bhikkhu overcoming all
the sphere of no-thingness attained to abides in the sphere of
neither-perception-nor-non-perception. Brahmin, this is more noble and
exalted than knowledges and vision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again the bhikkhu overcoming all
the sphere of neither-perception -nor non-perception attained to abides
in the cessation of perceptions and feelings. Seeing this with wisdom,
desires are also destroyed. Brahmin, this too is more noble and exalted
than knowledges and vision.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Brahmin, like a man wandering in
search of heartwood come to a huge standing tree with heartwood would
cut the heartwood and would carry it away knowing it is the heartwood,
for whatever purpose he sought that heartwood, to that purpose he would
come. I say, this person is comparable to that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Brahmin, this holy is led not for,
gain honour and fame, not for endowment of virtues, not for endowment
of concentration, and not for the endowment of knowledges and vision.
Brahmin, it is for the unshakeable release of mind. This is the essence
of the holy life, it is the heartwood and the end of the holy life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">When this was said the brahmin
Ping&agrave;lakocca said to the Blessed One, I understand good
Gotama, it is as though, something overturned is reinstated something
covered is made manifest. As though the path is told to someone who had
lost his way . Or as lighting an oil lamp for those who have eyes to
see forms in the dark. Thus good Gotama has explained the Teaching in
many ways. Now I take refuge in good Got&agrave;ma, in the
Teaching, and the Community of bhikkhus. May good Gotama bear me as a
lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.</font></p>
