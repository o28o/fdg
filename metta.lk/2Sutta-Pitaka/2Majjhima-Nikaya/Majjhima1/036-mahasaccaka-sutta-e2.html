<hr>
<p>... </p>
<p>[The Buddha is speaking to Saccaka Aggivessana:] </p>
<p>"Before my Awakening, when I was still an unawakened Bodhisatta, the
thought occurred to me: '<a name="road">The household</a> life is
crowded, a dusty road. Life gone forth is the open air. It isn't easy,
living in a home, to lead the holy life that is totally perfect,
totally pure, a polished shell. What if I, having shaved off my hair
&amp; beard and putting on the ochre robe, were to go forth from the
home life into homelessness?' </p>
<p>"So at a later time, when I was still young, black-haired, endowed
with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life, having shaved
off my hair &amp; beard -- though my parents wished otherwise and were
grieving with tears on their faces -- I put on the ochre robe and went
forth from the home life into homelessness. </p>
<p>"Having gone forth in search of what might be skillful, seeking the
unexcelled state of sublime peace, I went to <a name="alara">Alara
Kalama</a> and, on arrival, said to him: 'Friend Kalama, I want to
practice in this doctrine &amp; discipline.' </p>
<p>"When this was said, he replied to me, 'You may stay here, my
friend. This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter &amp;
dwell in his own teacher's knowledge, having realized it for himself
through direct knowledge.' </p>
<p>"It was not long before I learned the doctrine. As far as mere
lip-reciting &amp; repetition, I could speak the words of knowledge,
the words of the elders, and I could affirm that I knew &amp; saw -- I,
along with others. </p>
<p>"I thought: 'It isn't through mere conviction alone that Alara
Kalama declares, "I have entered &amp; dwell in this Dhamma, having
realized it for myself through direct knowledge." Certainly he dwells
knowing &amp; seeing this Dhamma.' So I went to him and said, 'To what
extent do you declare that you have entered &amp; dwell in this
Dhamma?' When this was said, he declared the sphere of nothingness. </p>
<p>"I thought: 'Not only does Alara Kalama have conviction,
persistence, mindfulness, concentration, &amp; discernment. I, too,
have conviction, persistence, mindfulness, concentration, &amp;
discernment. What if I were to endeavor to realize for myself the
Dhamma that Alara Kalama declares he has entered &amp; dwells in,
having realized it for himself through direct knowledge.' So it was not
long before I quickly entered &amp; dwelled in that Dhamma, having
realized it for myself through direct knowledge. I went to him and
said, 'Friend Kalama, is this the extent to which you have entered
&amp; dwell in this Dhamma, having realized it for yourself through
direct knowledge?' </p>
<p>"'Yes, my friend...' </p>
<p>"'This, friend, is the extent to which I, too, have entered &amp;
dwell in this Dhamma, having realized it for myself through direct
knowledge.' </p>
<p>"'It is a gain for us, my friend, a great gain for us, that we have
such a companion in the holy life. So the Dhamma I declare I have
entered &amp; dwell in, having realized it for myself through direct
knowledge, is the Dhamma you declare you have entered &amp; dwell in,
having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge. And the
Dhamma you declare you have entered &amp; dwell in, having realized it
for yourself through direct knowledge, is the Dhamma I declare I have
entered &amp; dwell in, having realized it for myself through direct
knowledge. The Dhamma I know is the Dhamma you know; the Dhamma you
know is the Dhamma I know. As I am, so are you; as you are, so am I.
Come friend, let us now lead this community together.' </p>
<p>"In this way did Alara Kalama, my teacher, place me, his pupil, on
the same level with himself and pay me great honor. But the thought
occurred to me, 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to
Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the sphere of
nothingness.' So, dissatisfied with that Dhamma, I left. </p>
<p>"In search of what might be skillful, seeking the unexcelled state
of sublime peace, I went to <a name="uddaka">Uddaka Ramaputta</a> and,
on arrival, said to him: 'Friend Uddaka, I want to practice in this
doctrine &amp; discipline.' </p>
<p>"When this was said, he replied to me, 'You may stay here, my
friend. This doctrine is such that a wise person can soon enter &amp;
dwell in his own teacher's knowledge, having realized it for himself
through direct knowledge.' </p>
<p>"It was not long before I quickly<!--{AG says that "it was not long before I quickly" is correct.}-->
learned the doctrine. As far as mere lip-reciting &amp; repetition, I
could speak the words of knowledge, the words of the elders, and I
could affirm that I knew &amp; saw -- I, along with others. </p>
<p>"I thought: 'It wasn't through mere conviction alone that Rama
declared, "I have entered &amp; dwell in this Dhamma, having realized
it for myself through direct knowledge." Certainly he dwelled knowing
&amp; seeing this Dhamma.' So I went to Uddaka and said, 'To what
extent did Rama declare that he had entered &amp; dwelled in this
Dhamma?' When this was said, Uddaka declared the sphere of neither
perception nor non-perception. </p>
<p>"I thought: 'Not only did Rama have conviction, persistence,
mindfulness, concentration, &amp; discernment. I, too, have conviction,
persistence, mindfulness, concentration, &amp; discernment. What if I
were to endeavor to realize for myself the Dhamma that Rama declared he
entered &amp; dwelled in, having realized it for himself through direct
knowledge.' So it was not long before I quickly entered &amp; dwelled
in that Dhamma, having realized it for myself through direct knowledge.
I went to Uddaka and said, 'Friend Uddaka, is this the extent to which
Rama entered &amp; dwelled in this Dhamma, having realized it for
himself through direct knowledge?' </p>
<p>"'Yes, my friend...' </p>
<p>"'This, friend, is the extent to which I, too, have entered &amp;
dwell in this Dhamma, having realized it for myself through direct
knowledge.' </p>
<p>"'It is a gain for us, my friend, a great gain for us, that we have
such a companion in the holy life. So the Dhamma Rama declared he
entered &amp; dwelled in, having realized it for himself through direct
knowledge, is the Dhamma you declare you have entered &amp; dwell in,
having realized it for yourself through direct knowledge. And the
Dhamma you declare you have entered &amp; dwell in, having realized it
for yourself through direct knowledge, is the Dhamma Rama declared he
entered &amp; dwelled in, having realized it for himself through direct
knowledge. The Dhamma he knew is the Dhamma you know; the Dhamma you
know is the Dhamma he knew. As he was, so are you; as you are, so was
he. Come friend, lead this community.' </p>
<p>"In this way did Uddaka Ramaputta, my companion in the holy life,
place me in the position of teacher and pay me great honor. But the
thought occurred to me, 'This Dhamma leads not to disenchantment, to
dispassion, to cessation, to stilling, to direct knowledge, to
Awakening, nor to Unbinding, but only to reappearance in the sphere of
neither perception nor non-perception.' So, dissatisfied with that
Dhamma, I left. </p>
<p>"In search of what might be skillful, seeking the unexcelled state
of sublime peace, I wandered by stages in the Magadhan country and came
to the military town of Uruvela. There I saw some delightful
countryside, with an inspiring forest grove, a clear-flowing river with
fine, delightful banks, and villages for alms-going on all sides. The
thought occurred to me: 'How delightful is this countryside, with its
inspiring forest grove, clear-flowing river with fine, delightful
banks, and villages for alms-going on all sides. This is just right for
the striving of a clansman intent on striving.' So I sat down right
there, thinking, 'This is just right for striving.' </p>
<p>"Then these three similes -- spontaneous, never before heard --
appeared to me. <a name="fire">Suppose</a> there were a wet, sappy
piece of timber lying in the water, and a man were to come along with
an upper fire-stick, thinking, 'I'll light a fire. I'll produce heat.'
Now what do you think? Would he be able to light a fire and produce
heat by rubbing the upper fire-stick in the wet, sappy timber lying in
the water?" </p>
<p>"No, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because the timber is wet &amp;
sappy, and besides it is lying in the water. Eventually the man would
reap only his share of weariness &amp; disappointment." </p>
<p>"So it is with any priest or contemplative who does not live
withdrawn from sensuality in body &amp; mind, and whose desire,
infatuation, urge, thirst, &amp; fever for sensuality is not
relinquished &amp; stilled within him: Whether or not he feels painful,
racking, piercing feelings due to his striving [for Awakening], he is
incapable of knowledge, vision, &amp; unexcelled self-awakening. This
was the first simile -- spontaneous, never before heard -- that
appeared to me. </p>
<p>"Then a second simile -- spontaneous, never before heard -- appeared
to me. Suppose there were a wet, sappy piece of timber lying on land
far from water, and a man were to come along with an upper fire-stick,
thinking, 'I'll light a fire. I'll produce heat.' Now what do you
think? Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the
upper fire-stick in the wet, sappy timber lying on land far from
water?" </p>
<p>"No, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because the timber is wet &amp;
sappy, even though it is lying on land far from water. Eventually the
man would reap only his share of weariness &amp; disappointment." </p>
<p>"So it is with any priest or contemplative who lives withdrawn from
sensuality in body only, but whose desire, infatuation, urge, thirst,
&amp; fever for sensuality is not relinquished &amp; stilled within
him: Whether or not he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
his striving, he is incapable of knowledge, vision, &amp; unexcelled
self-awakening. This was the second simile -- spontaneous, never before
heard -- that appeared to me. </p>
<p>"Then a third simile -- spontaneous, never before heard -- appeared
to me. Suppose there were a dry, sapless piece of timber lying on land
far from water, and a man were to come along with an upper fire-stick,
thinking, 'I'll light a fire. I'll produce heat.' Now what do you
think? Would he be able to light a fire and produce heat by rubbing the
upper fire-stick in the dry, sapless timber lying on land?" </p>
<p>"Yes, Master Gotama. Why is that? Because the timber is dry &amp;
sapless, and besides it is lying on land far from water." </p>
<p>"So it is with any priest or contemplative who lives withdrawn from
sensuality in body &amp; mind, and whose desire, infatuation, urge,
thirst, &amp; fever for sensuality is relinquished &amp; stilled within
him: Whether or not he feels painful, racking, piercing feelings due to
his striving, he is capable of knowledge, vision, &amp; unexcelled
self-awakening. This was the third simile -- spontaneous, never before
heard -- that appeared to me. </p>
<p>"I thought: 'Suppose that I, clenching my teeth and pressing my
tongue against the roof of my mouth, were to beat down, constrain,
&amp; crush my mind with my awareness.' So, clenching my teeth and
pressing my tongue against the roof of my mouth, I beat down,
constrained, &amp; crushed my mind with my awareness. Just as a strong
man, seizing a weaker man by the head or the throat or the shoulders,
would beat him down, constrain, &amp; crush him, in the same way I beat
down, constrained, &amp; crushed my mind with my awareness. As I did
so, sweat poured from my armpits. And although tireless persistence was
aroused in me, and unmuddled mindfulness established, my body was
aroused &amp; uncalm because of the painful exertion. But the painful
feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain. </p>
<p>"I thought: 'Suppose I were to become absorbed in the trance of
non-breathing.' So I stopped the in-breaths &amp; out-breaths in my
nose &amp; mouth. As I did so, there was a loud roaring of winds coming
out my earholes, <a name="wind">just like</a> the loud roar of winds
coming out of a smith's bellows...So I stopped the in-breaths &amp;
out-breaths in my nose &amp; mouth &amp; ears. As I did so, extreme
forces sliced through my head, <a name="head">just as</a> if a strong
man were slicing my head open with a sharp sword...Extreme pains arose
in my head, <a name="turban">just as</a> if a strong man were
tightening a turban made of tough leather straps around my
head...Extreme forces carved up my stomach cavity, <a name="butcher">just
as</a> if a butcher or his apprentice were to carve up the stomach
cavity of an ox...There was an extreme burning in my body, just as if
two strong men, grabbing a weaker man by the arms, were to roast &amp;
broil him over a pit of hot embers. And although tireless persistence
was aroused in me, and unmuddled mindfulness established, my body was
aroused &amp; uncalm because of the painful exertion. But the painful
feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain. </p>
<p>"Devas, on seeing me, said, 'Gotama the contemplative is dead.'
Other devas said, 'He isn't dead, he's dying.' Others said, 'He's
neither dead nor dying, he's an arahant, for this is the way arahants
live.' </p>
<p>"I thought: 'Suppose I were to practice going altogether without
food.' Then devas came to me and said, 'Dear sir, please don't practice
going altogether without food. If you go altogether without food, we'll
infuse divine nourishment in through your pores, and you will survive
on that.' I thought, 'If I were to claim to be completely fasting while
these devas are infusing divine nourishment in through my pores, I
would be lying.' So I dismissed them, saying, 'Enough.' </p>
<p>"I thought: 'Suppose I were to take only a little food at a time,
only a handful at a time of bean soup, lentil soup, vetch soup, or pea
soup.' So I took only a little food at a time, only handful at a time
of bean soup, lentil soup, vetch soup, or pea soup. My body became
extremely emaciated. Simply from my eating so little, my limbs became
like the jointed segments of vine stems or bamboo stems...My backside
became like a camel's hoof...My spine stood out like a string of
beads...My ribs jutted out like the jutting rafters of an old, run-down
barn...The gleam of my eyes appeared to be sunk deep in my eye sockets
like the gleam of water deep in a well...My scalp shriveled &amp;
withered like a green bitter gourd, shriveled &amp; withered in the
heat &amp; the wind...The skin of my belly became so stuck to my spine
that when I thought of touching my belly, I grabbed hold of my spine as
well; and when I thought of touching my spine, I grabbed hold of the
skin of my belly as well...If I urinated or defecated, I fell over on
my face right there...Simply from my eating so little, if I tried to
ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair -- rotted at
its roots -- fell from my body as I rubbed, simply from eating so
little. </p>
<p>"People on seeing me would say, 'Gotama the contemplative is black.
Other people would say, 'Gotama the contemplative isn't black, he's
brown.' Others would say, 'Gotama the contemplative is neither black
nor brown, he's golden-skinned. So much had the clear, bright color of
my skin deteriorated, simply from eating so little. </p>
<p>"I thought: 'Whatever priests or contemplatives in the past have
felt painful, racking, piercing feelings due to their striving, this is
the utmost. None have been greater than this. Whatever priests or
contemplatives in the future will feel painful, racking, piercing
feelings due to their striving, this is the utmost. None will be
greater than this. Whatever priests or contemplatives in the present
are feeling painful, racking, piercing feelings due to their striving,
this is the utmost. None is greater than this. But with this racking
practice of austerities I haven't attained any superior human state,
any distinction in knowledge or vision worthy of the noble ones. Could
there be another path to Awakening?' </p>
<p>"I thought: 'I recall once, when my father the Sakyan was working,
and I was sitting in the cool shade of a rose-apple tree, then -- quite
withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities
-- I entered &amp; remained in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure
born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation.
Could that be the path to Awakening?' Then, following on that memory,
came the realization: 'That is the path to Awakening.' I thought: 'So
why am I afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with
sensuality, nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities?' I thought:
'I am no longer afraid of that pleasure that has nothing to do with
sensuality, nothing to do with unskillful mental qualities, but it is
not easy to achieve that pleasure with a body so extremely emaciated.
Suppose I were to take some solid food: some rice &amp; porridge.' So I
took some solid food: some rice &amp; porridge. Now five monks had been
attending on me, thinking, 'If Gotama, our contemplative, achieves some
higher state, he will tell us.' But when they saw me taking some solid
food -- some rice &amp; porridge -- they were disgusted and left me,
thinking, 'Gotama the contemplative is living luxuriously. He has
abandoned his exertion and is backsliding into abundance.' </p>
<p>"So when I had taken solid food and regained strength, then -- quite
withdrawn from sensuality, withdrawn from unskillful mental qualities,
I entered &amp; remained in the first jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure
born from withdrawal, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation.
But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not invade my mind
or remain. With the stilling of directed thought &amp; evaluation, I
entered &amp; remained in the second jhana: rapture &amp; pleasure born
of composure, unification of awareness free from directed thought &amp;
evaluation -- internal assurance. But the pleasant feeling that arose
in this way did not invade my mind or remain. With the fading of
rapture I remained in equanimity, mindful &amp; alert, and physically
sensitive of pleasure. I entered &amp; remained in the third jhana, of
which the Noble Ones declare, 'Equanimous &amp; mindful, he has a
pleasurable abiding.' But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way
did not invade my mind or remain. With the abandoning of pleasure &amp;
pain -- as with the earlier disappearance of elation &amp; distress --
I entered &amp; remained in the fourth jhana: purity of equanimity
&amp; mindfulness, neither pleasure nor pain. But the pleasant feeling
that arose in this way did not invade my mind or remain. </p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my
past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives, i.e., one birth,
two...five, ten...fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand,
many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many
eons of cosmic contraction &amp; expansion: 'There I had such a name,
belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such
my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing
away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name,
belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such
my experience of pleasure &amp; pain, such the end of my life. Passing
away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus I remembered my manifold
past lives in their modes &amp; details. </p>
<p>"This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed; light arose -- as happens in one who is heedful, ardent,
&amp; resolute. But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not
invade my mind or remain. </p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away
&amp; reappearance of beings. I saw -- by means of the divine eye,
purified &amp; surpassing the human -- beings passing away &amp;
re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp; superior,
beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in accordance with
their kamma: 'These beings -- who were endowed with bad conduct of
body, speech, &amp; mind, who reviled the noble ones, held wrong views
and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views -- with the
break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of
deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these
beings -- who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech &amp;
mind, who did not revile the noble ones, who held right views and
undertook actions under the influence of right views -- with the
break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good
destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus -- by means of the divine
eye, purified &amp; surpassing the human -- I saw beings passing away
&amp; re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior &amp;
superior, beautiful &amp; ugly, fortunate &amp; unfortunate in
accordance with their kamma. </p>
<p>"This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed; light arose -- as happens in one who is heedful, ardent,
&amp; resolute. But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not
invade my mind or remain. </p>
<p>"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished,
rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, &amp; attained to
imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the
mental fermentations. I discerned, as it was actually present, that
'This is stress...This is the origination of stress...This is the
cessation of stress...This is the way leading to the cessation of
stress...These are fermentations...This is the origination of
fermentations...This is the cessation of fermentations...This is the
way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' My heart, thus knowing,
thus seeing, was released from the fermentation of sensuality, released
from the fermentation of becoming, released from the fermentation of
ignorance. With release, there was the knowledge, 'Released.' I
discerned that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done.
There is nothing further for this world.' </p>
<p>"This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the
night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was
destroyed; light arose -- as happens in one who is heedful, ardent,
&amp; resolute. But the pleasant feeling that arose in this way did not
invade my mind or remain." </p>
