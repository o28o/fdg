</font></i><font face="Times_CSX+">(39) The Longer Discourse in
Assapura</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">I heard thus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">At one time the Blessed One lived
in the Anga country, in a hamlet named Assapura and addressed the
bhikkhus from there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, people call you recluses,
and you too acknowledge we are recluses. Bhikkhus, you, who have
promised to be a recluse, should take upon yourself to abide by the
things that make you a recluse and a brahmin. By that our recluseship
becomes true, and our promise is carried out. May it be fruitful to
them that offer us robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when
ill. May my going forth be fruitful, and full of results. Bhikkhus, you
should train thus.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, what are the things that
make you a recluse and a brahmin? We will be endowed with shame and
remorse. Bhikkhus, thus you should train. Bhikkhus, it might occur to
you thus;. We are endowed with shame and remorse. With this much our
recluseship is done. If you be satisfied, thinking there is nothing
more to do, I inform, entreat, and annonce to you, do not fall from
your recluseship, there is something more to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, what further thing has to
be done? We will be pure in our bodily actions manifest, open and
without a flaw. Yet on account of that purity of bodily actions we will
not praise ourselves or disparage others. Bhikkhus, thus you should
train. It might occur to you. We are endowed with shame and remorse and
our bodily actions will be pure. When this much is done, our
recluseship is done. If you be satisfied, thinking there is nothing
more to do. I inform, entreat and announce to you, do not fall from
your recluseship, there is something more to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, what further thing has to
be done? We will be pure in verbal actions manifest, open and without a
flaw. Yet on account of that purity of verbal actions we will not
praise ourselves or disparage others. Bhikkhus, thus you should train.
It might occur to you. We are endowed with shame and remorse, our
bodily actions are pure, our verbal actions are pure. When this much is
done, our recluseship is done. If you be satisfied, thinking there is
nothing more to do, I inform, entreat and announce to you, do not fall
from your recluseship, there is something more to do. ... . </font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, what further thing has to
be done. We will be pure in mental actions manifest, open and without a
flaw. Yet on account of that purity of mental actions we will not
praise ourselves or disparage others. Bhikkhus, thus you should train.
It might occur to you. We are endowed with shame and remorse, our
bodily actions are pure, our verbal actions are pure. Our mental
actions are pure. When this much is done, our recluseship is done. If
you be satisfied, thinking there is nothing more to do, I inform,
entreat and announce to you, do not fall from your recluseship, there
is something more to do. ... </font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, what further thing has to
be done? We will be pure in our livelihood manifest, open and without a
flaw. Yet on account of that purity of livelihood we will not praise
ourselves or disparage others. Bhikkhus, thus you should train. It
might occur to you We are endowed with shame and remorse, our bodily
actions are pure, our verbal actions are pure. Our mental actions are
pure . and our livelihood is pure. When this much is done, our
recluseship is done. If you be satisfied, thinking there is nothing
more to do, I inform, entreat and announce to you, do not fall from
your recluseship, there is something more to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, what further thing has to
be done? We will be with protected mental faculties. Seeing a form with
the eye we will not take the sign or the details. To one living with
the mental faculty of the eye not protected, evil demerit of
covetousness and displeasure may arise. To control it, we fall. Hearing
a sound with the ear, Cognising a smell with the nose, Cognising a
taste with the tongue, Cognising a touch with the body, Cognising an
idea with the mind will not take the sign or the details. To one living
with the mental faculty of the mind not protected, evil demerit of
covetousness and displeasure may arise. To control it we fall. Thus you
should train It might occur to you. We are endowed with shame and
remorse, our bodily actions are pure, our verbal actions are pure. Our
mental actions are pure . and our livelihood is pure. We are controlled
in our mental faculties. When this much is done, our recluseship is
done. If you be satisfied, thinking there is nothing more to do, I
inform, entreat and announce to you, do not fall from your recluseship,
there is something more to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, what further thing has to
be done? We will know the right amount to partake food. Reflecting we
will partake food, not for play, not for intoxication, not for growth
and beauty, for the upkeep of this body, not to enjoy soups. As support
to lead the holy life. Putting an end to earlier feelings, will not
arouse new feelings. It will be without blame for a pleasant abiding.
Thus you should train. It might occur to you. We are endowed with shame
and remorse, pure bodily actions, pure verbal actions,
pure&uuml;ental actions and a pure livelihood. We are controlled in
our mental faculties. We know the right amount to partake of food ...
When this much is done, our recluseship is done. If you be satisfied,
thinking there is nothing more to do. I inform, entreat and announce to
you, do not fall from your recluseship. There is something more to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, what further thing has to
be done? We should be yoked to wakefulness. During the day seated in
the chankamana, we will clean the mind of obstructing things. In the
first watch of the night seated in the chankamana, we will clean the
mind of obstructing things. In the middle watch of the night, turning
to the right side making the lion's posture, keeping one foot over the
other, mindful and aware of the time of waking we will lie. In the last
watch of the night . seated in the chankamana we will clean the mind of
obstructing things. Thus you should train. Bhikkhus, . it might occur
to you thus. We are endowed with shame and remorse, our bodily, verbal
and mental actions are pure. Our livelihood is pure. We are controlled
in our mental faculties. We know the right amount to partake of food
... We are yoked to wakefulness. When this much is done, our
recluseship is done. If you be satisfied, thinking there is nothing
more to do. I inform, entreat and announce to you, do not fall from
your recluseship, there is something more to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, what further thing has to
be done? We will be endowed with mindful awareness. Coming forward and
turning back we will be aware. Looking on and looking away we will be
aware. Bending and stretching we will be aware, Wearing the three robes
and bowl we will be aware. Tasting, drinking, eating and enjoying we
will be aware. Urinating and excreting we will be aware. Going,
standing, sitting, lying, awake, talking or being silent we will be
aware. Thus you should train. Bhikkhus, it might occur to you. We are
endowed with shame and remorse. Our bodily, verbal and mental actions
are pure. Our livelihood is pure. We are controlled in our mental
faculties. We know the right amount to partake of food ... We are yoked
to wakefulness ... We are mindful and aware. When this much is done,
our recluseship is done. If you be satisfied, thinking there is nothing
more to do. I inform, entreat and announce to you, do not fall from
your recluseship. There is something more to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, what further thing has to
be done. We will abide in a secluded dwelling a forest, the root of a
tree, mountain grotto or cave, a charnel ground, a forest jungle, an
open space, or a heap of straw. Returning from the alms round, after
the meal is over, we will sit in a cross-legged posture, mindfulness
established in front. Dispelling covetousness for the world. Will abide
with a mind free of covetousness. Dispelling anger will abide with a
mind free of anger. With the perception of light will abide sloth and
torpor dispelled from the mind. Will abide appeasing the self,
dispelling restlessness and worry. Will abide dispelling doubts, about
merit that should and should not be done</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, like a man would borrow
some money to engage in some business. When that business prospered, he
would pay off the debt and would have some money remaining for his wife
and children. So he would reflect, earlier I borrowed this money and
engaged in this business. It prospered. I paid off the debt and now I
have some money remaining to attend to my wife and children. He gains
joy and pleasure on account of it. Or like a man who was seriously ill,
not desiring even to take food, and in the meantime he would get over
the illness Food too will become agreeable to him and he would regain
his bodily strength. So he reflects, earlier I was seriously ill, food
was not agreeable to me. Now I have overcome that illness, food is
agreeable, and now I have regained my bodily strength. Recalling this
he gains joy and pleasure. Or like a man, released from prison. Happy
and without fear and not losing his wealth. He reflects, earlier I was
a prisoner, now am free and happy. I have not lost my wealth and now I
live without fear. Recalling that he gains pleasure and joy. Or like a
man who was a slave under another's power, not in his own power, not
able to go where he liked. Released he is no more under another's
power, using his power, freed from slavery would go where he liked. He
reflects, earlier, I was a slave, under another's power, not in my own
power. Now I `m free, in my own power, free to go where I like. On
account of that he gains joy and pleasure. Or like a man in a desert
with his wealth. Would safely cross the desert without loss of wealth.
He would reflect, I entered the desert path with all my wealth and
crossed the desert safely without loss of life or wealth and he gains
pleasure and joy on account of it. In the same manner the bhikkhu sees
himself as though in debt, with an illness, in prison, as a slave, and
as in a desert path when the five hindrances are not dispelled, When
they are dispelled he sees himself as the debt paid off, the illness
subsided, released from prison, released from slavery, and as having
crossed the desert path</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Dispelling the five hindrances and
wisely making less the minor defilements of the mind, he secludes the
mind from sensual thoughts and defiling thoughts. With thoughts and
thought processes, and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion,
attained to abides in the first jh&agrave;na. He pervades this
body, perfects it and fills it up with joy and pleasantness born of
seclusion. Does not leave a single spot untouched with that joy and
pleasantness born of seclusion. Bhikkhus, like a bather or his
apprentice, would place some bathing powder in a bronze vessel, would
mix it sprinkling water and turning it into a ball of lather. He would
mix it well, until the lather becomes a ball and nothing would trickle
down from it. In the same manner he would pervade this body, perfect it
and fill it up with the joy and pleasantness born of seclusion, not
leaving a single spot untouched with that joy and pleasantness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again, the bhikkhu overcoming,
thoughts and thought processes, would bring the mind to a single point
appeasing it internally. And without thoughts and thought processes and
with joy and pleasantness born of concentration would attain to abide
in the second jh&agrave;na. Then he would pervade this body,
perfect it and fill it up with joy and pleasantness born of
concentration. He would not leave a single spot untouched with that joy
and pleasantness born of concentration. Like a deep pond without inlets
from the east, west, north or south, is filled up with cool water
springing from the bottom. Rain water too would not enter it. The cool
water coming up, would fill it flowing all round and completing it, not
leaving a single spot untouched by that cold water. In the same manner
he pervades this body, perfects it and fills it up with joy and
pleasantness born of concentration. Would not leave a single spot
untouched with the joy and pleasantness born of concentration. .</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again, the bhikkhu, with equanimity
to joy and detachment, would abide mindful and aware, experiencing
pleasantness too with the body and abide attained to the third
jh&agrave;na. To this the noble ones say abiding in pleasantness
with equanimity. Then he pervades this body, perfects it, fills it up
with pleasantness devoid of joy. Would not leave a single spot
untouched with that pleasantness devoid of joy. Like, of blue, red and
white lotuses that grow in a pond, some are born, grow, develop,
nourish and bloom in the water. Their tops and roots are pervaded with
the cold water and they do not have a place not touched with the cold
water. In the same manner he pervades this body, perfects it, and fills
it up with pleasantness devoid of joy, touching everything with that
pleasantness.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Again the bhikkhu, dispelling
pleasantness and unpleasantness, and earlier over coming, pleasure and
displeasure, with mindfulness purified with equanimity attained to
abides in the fourth jh&agrave;na. Then. he sits pervading the
whole body with that pure and clean mind, not leaving out any spot.
Like a man who has covered himself with a white cloth together with the
head, without leaving out anything. In the same manner he sits
pervading the whole body with that pure clean mind, not leaving out any
spot untouched with the pure clean mind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">When the mind is concentrated,
pure, free from minor defilements is malleable workable not disturbed,
he directs the mind for the knowledge of previous births. Recollects
the manifold previous births, one birth, two births, three, four, five,
ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred births, a thousand births,
a hundred thousand births, innumerable forward cycles of births,
innumerable backward cycles of births, innumerable forward and backward
cycles of births. There I was of such name, clan, disposition,
supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with
such a life span. Disappearing from there, was born there, with such
name, clan, disposition, supports, experiencing such pleasant and
unpleasant feelings, with such a life span. Disappearing from there, is
born here. Thus with all modes and all details he recollects the
manifold previous births.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">When the mind is concentrated,
pure, free from minor defilements, malleable workable not disturbed, he
directs the mind for the knowledge of the disappearing and appearing of
beings. With the heavenly eye purified beyond human, he sees beings
disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly,
arising in good and bad states according to their actions: These good
beings misbehaving by body, speech and mind, blaming noble ones, with
the wrong view of actions, after death are born in loss, in decrease,
in hell. As for these good beings, well behaved in body speech and
mind, not blaming noble ones, with the right view of actions after
death are born in heaven. Thus with the heavenly eye purified beyond
human he sees beings disappearing and appearing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">When the mind is concentrated,
pure, free from minor defilements, malleable workable not disturbed, he
directs the mind for the destruction of desires. Knows, this is
unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the
cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path to the cessation of
unpleasantness as it really is.: Knows these are desires, this the
arising of desires, this the cessation of desires and this is the path
to the cessation of desires as it really is. When he knows thus and
sees thus his mind is released from sensual desires, the desires `to
be', and desires of ignorance. Knowledge arises I'm released, birth is
destroyed, have done what should be done. The holy life is lived, there
is nothing more to wish. Like a man standing on the bank of a pond in a
mountain glen with pure clear undisturbed water would clearly see
shells, pebbles, stones and gravel and shoals of fish moving and
floating in the water. In the same manner, he knows this is unpleasant,
this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of
unpleasantnes and this is the path to the cessation of unpleasantness
as it really is. Knows, these are desires, this the arising of desires
this is the cessation of desires and this is the path to the cessation
of desires as it really is. When he knows thus and sees thus, his mind
is released from sensual desires, from desires `to be' and from desires
of ignorance. Knowledge arises I'm released He knows birth is
destroyed, what should be done, is done. The holy life is lived, there
is nothing more to wish.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times_CSX+">Bhikkhus, to this is said the
