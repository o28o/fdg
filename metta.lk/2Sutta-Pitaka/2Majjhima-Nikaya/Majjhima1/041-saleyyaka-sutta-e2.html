<p><b>Introduction</b> (by Bhikkhu Khantipalo)<br>
The brahmins of this discourse, intelligent people, asked a question
about the causality of rebirth -- why is one reborn in the states of
deprivation (the hells, animals, and ghosts) while others make it to
the heaven worlds? </p>
<p>The Buddha then analyzes what kind of kamma will take one to a low
rebirth. You see any of your own actions here? Then you know what to do
about it, for if one makes any of these ten courses of unwholesome
kamma strong in oneself, a result can be expected at least "on the
dissolution of the body, after death," if not in this life. </p>
<p>The ten courses of wholesome kamma follow. They should be
strengthened in oneself, repeated frequently so that they become
habitual. If one recognizes any of one's own actions among them, then
just guard against the conceit: "I am good." </p>
<p>The last part of the sutta deals with the aspirations which one may
have for rebirth at the time of death. Of course, one's previously made
kamma must be such that it will support such aspirations. A miser might
aspire to riches but his kamma will give him poverty. If a person has
kept the Uposatha and generally all the precepts and been generous and
truthful as well, this is the passport to heavenly birth (from the gods
of the Four Kings up to the gods that Wield Power over others'
Creations). Beyond this, it is necessary also to be proficient in jhana
and one will gain rebirth among the Brahmas (from the Divinity's
Retinue to the Very Fruitful gods) according to proficiency in this.
For the next five Brahma-planes, the state of non-returning is
required, while for the last four one must have gained the formless
attainments. Finally, one may aspire to no rebirth: to Arahantship, but
of course the aspiration alone is not sufficient -- practice and
sufficient insight-wisdom are needed. </p>

<p></p>
<p>1. Thus have I heard. On one occasion the Blessed One was wandering
in the <a name="kosala">Kosalan</a> country with a large Sangha of
bhikkhus, and eventually he arrived at a Kosalan brahmin village called
<a name="sala">Sala</a>. </p>
<p>2. The brahmin householders of Sala heard: "A monk called Gotama, it
seems, a son of the Sakyans who went forth from a Sakyan clan, has been
wandering in the Kosalan country with a large Sangha of bhikkhus and
has come to Sala. Now a good report of Master Gotama has been spread to
this effect: 'That Blessed One is such since he is Arahant and Fully
Enlightened, perfect in true knowledge and conduct, sublime, knower of
worlds, incomparable teacher of men to be tamed, teacher of gods and
humans, enlightened, blessed. He describes this world with its gods,
its Maras, and its (Brahma) Divinities, this generation with its monks
and brahmins, with its kings and its people, which he has himself
realized through direct knowledge. He teaches a Dhamma that is good in
the beginning, good in the middle and good in the end with (the right)
meaning and phrasing, he affirms a holy life that is utterly perfect
and pure.' Now it is good to see such Arahants." </p>
<p>3. The brahmin householders of Sala went to the Blessed One; and
some paid homage to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some
exchanged greetings with him, and when the courteous and amiable talk
was finished, sat down at one side; some raised hands palms together in
salutation to the Blessed One and sat down at one side; some pronounced
their name and clan in the Blessed One's presence and sat down at one
side; some kept silence and sat down at one side. </p>
<p>4. When they were seated, they said to the Blessed One: "Master
Gotama, what is the reason, what is the condition, why some beings
here, on the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in states
of deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell;
and what is the reason, what is the condition, why some beings here, on
the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a happy
destination, even in the heavenly world?" </p>
<p>5. "Householders, it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with
the Dhamma, by reason of unrighteous conduct, that beings here on the
dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in states of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. It
is by reason of conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, by reason of
righteous conduct, that some beings here on the dissolution of the
body, after death, reappear in a happy destination, even in the
heavenly world." </p>
<p>6. "We do not understand the detailed meaning of this utterance of
Master Gotama's spoken in brief without expounding the detailed
meaning. It would be good if Master Gotama taught us the Dhamma so that
we might understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's utterance
spoken in brief without expounding the detailed meaning." </p>
<p>"Then, householders, listen and heed well what I shall say." </p>
<p>"Yes, venerable sir," they replied. The Blessed One said this: </p>
<p>7. "Householders, there are three kinds of bodily conduct not in
accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct. There are four kinds
of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous
conduct. There are three kinds of mental conduct not in accordance with
the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct. </p>
<p>8. "And how are there three kinds of bodily conduct not in
accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone is a
killer of living beings: he is murderous, bloody-handed, given to blows
and violence, and merciless to all living beings. He is a taker of what
is not given: he takes as a thief another's chattels and property in
the village or in the forest. He is given over to misconduct in sexual
desires: he has intercourse with such (women) as are protected by the
mother, father, (mother and father), brother, sister, relatives, as
have a husband, as entail a penalty, and also with those that are
garlanded in token of betrothal. That is how there are three kinds of
bodily conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct. </p>
<p>9. "And how are there four kinds of verbal conduct not in accordance
with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone speaks falsehood:
when summoned to a court or to a meeting, or to his relatives'
presence, or to his guild, or to the royal family's presence, and
questioned as a witness thus, 'So, good man, tell what you know,' then,
not knowing, he says 'I know,' or knowing, he says 'I do not know,' not
seeing, he says 'I see,' or seeing, he says 'I do not see'; in full
awareness he speaks falsehood for his own ends or for another's ends or
for some trifling worldly end. He speaks maliciously: he is a repeater
elsewhere of what is heard here for the purpose of causing division
from these, or he is a repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for
the purpose of causing division from those, and he is thus a divider of
the united, a creator of divisions, who enjoys discord, rejoices in
discord, delights in discord, he is a speaker of words that create
discord. He speaks harshly: he utters such words as are rough, hard,
hurtful to others, censorious of others, bordering on anger and
unconducive to concentration. He is a gossip: as one who tells that
which is unseasonable, that which is not fact, that which is not good,
that which is not the Dhamma, that which is not the Discipline, and he
speaks out of season speech not worth recording, which is unreasoned,
indefinite, and unconnected with good. That is how there are four kinds
of verbal conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous
conduct. </p>
<p>10. "And how are there three kinds of mental conduct not in
accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous conduct? Here someone is
covetous: he is a coveter of another's chattels and property thus: 'Oh,
that what is another's were mine!' Or he has a mind of ill will, with
the intention of a mind affected by hate thus: 'May these beings be
slain and slaughtered, may they be cut off, perish, or be annihilated!'
Or he has wrong view, distorted vision, thus: 'There is nothing given,
nothing offered, nothing sacrificed, no fruit and ripening of good and
bad kammas, no this world, no other world, no mother, no father, no
spontaneously (born) beings,<a name="BM1"> </a>[<a href="#n1">1</a>]
no good and virtuous monks and brahmins that have themselves realized
by direct knowledge and declare this world and the other world.' <a
 name="BM2">[</a><a href="#n2">2</a>] That is how there are three kinds
of mental conduct not in accordance with the Dhamma, unrighteous
conduct. </p>
<p>"So, householders, it is by reason of conduct not in accordance with
the Dhamma, by reason of unrighteous conduct, that some beings here, on
the dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in states of
deprivation, in an unhappy destination, in perdition, even in hell. </p>
<p>11. "Householders, there are three kinds of bodily conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct. There are four kinds of
verbal conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct. There
are three kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma,
righteous conduct. </p>
<p>12. "And how are there three kinds of bodily conduct in accordance
with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone, abandoning the
killing of living beings, becomes one who abstains from killing living
beings; with rod and weapon laid aside, gentle and kindly, he abides
compassionate to all living beings. Abandoning the taking of what is
not given, he becomes one who abstains from taking what is not given;
he does not take as a thief another's chattels and property in the
village or in the forest. Abandoning misconduct in sexual desires, he
becomes one who abstains from misconduct in sexual desires: he does not
have intercourse with such women as are protected by mother, father,
(father and mother), brother, sister, relatives, as have a husband, as
entail a penalty, and also those that are garlanded in token of
betrothal. That is how there are three kinds of bodily conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct. </p>
<p>13. "And how are there four of verbal conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone, abandoning false speech,
becomes one who abstains from false speech: when summoned to a court or
to a meeting or to his relatives' presence or to his guild or to the
royal family's presence, and questioned as a witness thus, 'So, good
man, tell what you know,' not knowing, he says 'I do not know,' or
knowing, he says 'I know,' not seeing he says 'I do not see,' or
seeing, he says 'I see'; he does not in full awareness speak falsehood
for his own ends or for another's ends or for some trifling worldly
end. Abandoning malicious speech, he becomes one who abstains from
malicious speech: as one who is neither a repeater elsewhere of what is
heard here for the purpose of causing division from these, nor a
repeater to these of what is heard elsewhere for the purpose of causing
division from those, who is thus a reuniter of the divided, a promoter
of friendships, enjoying concord, rejoicing in concord, delighting in
concord, he becomes a speaker of words that promote concord. Abandoning
harsh speech, he becomes one who abstains from harsh speech: he becomes
a speaker of such words as are innocent, pleasing to the ear and
lovable, as go to the heart, are civil, desired of many and dear to
many. Abandoning gossip, he becomes one who abstains from gossip: as
one who tells that which is seasonable, that which is factual, that
which is good, that which is the Dhamma, that which is the Discipline,
he speaks in season speech worth recording, which is reasoned, definite
and connected with good. That is how there are four kinds of verbal
conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct. </p>
<p>14. "And how are there three kinds of mental conduct in accordance
with the Dhamma, righteous conduct? Here someone is not covetous: he is
not a coveter of another's chattels and property thus: 'Oh, that what
is another's were mine!' He has no mind of ill will, with the intention
of a mind unaffected by hate thus: 'May these beings be free from
enmity, affliction and anxiety, may they live happily!' He has right
view, undistorted vision, thus: 'There is what is given and what is
offered and what is sacrificed, and there is fruit and ripening of good
and bad kammas, and there is this world and the other world and mother
and father and spontaneously (born) beings, and good and virtuous monks
and brahmins that have themselves realized by direct knowledge and
declared this world and the other world.' That is how there are three
kinds of mental conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous
conduct. </p>
<p>"So, householders, it is by reason of conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, by reason of righteous conduct, that some beings here, on the
dissolution of the body, after death, reappear in a happy destination,
even in the heavenly world. </p>
<p>15. "If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that on the dissolution of
the body, after death, I might reappear in the company of the
warrior-nobles of great property!' it is possible that on the
dissolution of the body, after death, he may do so. Why is that?
Because he observes conduct that is in accordance with the Dhamma,
righteous conduct. </p>
<p>16. "If a householder who observes conduct is accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that on the dissolution of
the body, after death, I might reappear in the company of the brahmins
of great property!' it is possible... </p>
<p>17. "If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma,...'...I might reappear in the company of householders of great
property!' it is possible... </p>
<p>18. "If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that on the dissolution of
the body, after death, I might reappear in the company of the gods of
the Four Kings!' it is possible that on the dissolution of the body,
after death, he may do so. Why is that? Because he observes conduct in
accordance with the Dhamma, righteous conduct. </p>

<p>42. "If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that on the dissolution of
the body, after death, I might reappear in the company of the gods of
the base consisting of neither-perception-nor-non-perception!' it is
possible that, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he may do
so. Why is that? Because he observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct. </p>
<p>43. "If a householder who observes conduct in accordance with the
Dhamma, righteous conduct, should wish: 'Oh, that by realization myself
with direct knowledge, I may here and now enter upon and abide in the
deliverance of the heart and the deliverance by wisdom that are
taint-free with exhaustion of taints!' it is possible that, by
realization himself with direct knowledge, he may here and now enter
upon and abide in the deliverance of the heart and the deliverance by
wisdom that are taint-free with exhaustion of taints. Why is that?
Because he observes conduct in accordance with the Dhamma, righteous
conduct." </p>
<p>44. When this was said, the brahmin householders of Sala said to the
Blessed One: </p>
<p>"<a name="magnif">Magnificent</a>, Master Gotama! Magnificent,
Master Gotama! The Dhamma has been made clear in many ways by Master
Gotama, as though he were turning upright what had been overthrown,
revealing the hidden, showing the way to one who was lost, holding up a
lamp in the darkness for those with eyes to see forms. </p>
<p>45. "We go to Master Gotama for refuge, and to the Dhamma, and to
the Sangha of bhikkhus. From today let Master Gotama accept us as
followers who have gone to him for refuge for life." </p>
