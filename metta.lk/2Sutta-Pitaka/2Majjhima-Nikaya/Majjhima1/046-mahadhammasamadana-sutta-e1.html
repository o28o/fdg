(46) The Longer Discourse on Observances</P>
</B><P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&iuml;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, humans are always with interests, desires and intentions, like these. May unwelcome, disagreeable and unpleasant things decrease and may welcome, agreeable and pleasant things increase. Bhikkhus, to them, with such interests, desires and intentions, unwelcome, disagreeable and unpleasant things increase and welcome, agreeable and pleasant things decrease. Bhikkhus, do you understand the reason for it. Venerable sir, the Blessed One is the originator, leader and the refuge of the Teaching, may the Blessed One himself explain the meaning of these words. The bhikkhus will bear it in mind, hearing it from the Blessed One. Then bhikkhus, listen carefully I will preach.</P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, the not learned ordinary man, who has not seen noble ones, and Great Men, not heard their Teaching and not trained in their Teaching, does not know the things that should be practised and the things that should not be practised. He practises things that should not be practised and does not practise the things that should be practised. To him who practises things that should not be practised and does not practise things that should be practised unwelcome, disagreeable, unpleasant things increase and welcome, agreeable, pleasant things decrease. What is the reason? Bhikkhus, it happens thus to the unwise.</P>

To him who practises things that should be practised and does not practise things that should not be practised unwelcome, disagreeable, unpleasant things decrease and welcome, agreeable, pleasant things increase. What is the reason:Bhikkhus, it happens thus to the wise.</P>

<P>Bhikkhus, a man who wants to live and not die, who likes pleasantnes, loathes unpleasantness, would come along and is told :Friend, this is a drink prepared out of the bitter goad, and it is mixed with poison. It is not agreeable to sight, smell, or taste, and drinking it you will come to death or deathly unpleasantness. If you desire drink. Not reflecting about it, he would drink. To sight, smell or taste it would not be agreeable and drinking it, he would come to death or deathly unpleasanatness.
