...
<p>Then <a name="koravya">King Koravya</a> said to his gamekeeper:
"Clean up the <a name="migacira">Migacira</a> pleasure garden. I am
going there to see the beautiful grounds."
</p>
<p>"As you say, your majesty," the gamekeeper responded to the king. As
he was cleaning up Migacira he saw <a name="ratthapala">Ven. Ratthapala</a>
sitting in the shade of a certain tree for the day's abiding. On seeing
him, he went to the king and said, "Migacira has been cleaned up for
you, your majesty. And the clansman Ratthapala -- the son of the
leading clan in this <a name="thullakotthita">Thullakotthita</a>, of
whom you have often spoken highly -- is there, sitting in the shade of
a certain tree for the day's abiding."
</p>
<p>"In that case, my dear gamekeeper, never mind about the pleasure
garden for today. I am now going to pay my respects to that Master
Ratthapala."
</p>
<p>Then, saying, "Give away all the staple and non-staple foods that
have been prepared," King Koravya had auspicious vehicles harnessed.
Mounting an auspicious vehicle he set out from Thullakotthita
accompanied by other auspicious vehicles in full royal pomp to see Ven.
Ratthapala. Going as far by vehicle as the ground would permit, he
dismounted and went to Ven. Ratthapala, accompanied by many eminent
members of his court. On arrival, he exchanged courteous greetings with
Ven. Ratthapala. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp;
courtesies, he stood to one side. As he was standing there, he said to
Ven. Ratthapala, "May Master Ratthapala sit here on the elephant rug."
</p>
<p>"Never mind, great king. You sit there. I am sitting on my own
seat."
</p>
<p>So King Koravya sat down on the seat prepared. As he was sitting
there, he said to Ven. Ratthapala, "There are cases where, having
suffered these four kinds of loss, men shave off their hair &amp;
beard, put on the ochre robe, and go forth from the home life into
homelessness. Which four? Loss through aging, loss through illness,
loss of wealth, &amp; loss of relatives...But Master Ratthapala has
suffered none of these. What did he know or see or hear that Master
Ratthapala went forth from the home life into homelessness?"
</p>
<p>"Great king, there are four Dhamma summaries stated by the Blessed
One who knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened. Having
known &amp; seen &amp; heard them, I went forth from the home life into
homelessness. Which four?
</p>
<p>"'The world[<a href="#n1" name="1">1</a>] is swept away. It does not
endure': This is the first Dhamma summary stated by the Blessed One who
knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened. Having known
&amp; seen &amp; heard it, I went forth from the home life into
homelessness.
</p>
<p>"'The world is without shelter, without protector': This is the
second Dhamma summary...
</p>
<p>"'The world is without ownership. One has to pass on, leaving
everything behind': This is the third Dhamma summary...
</p>
<p>"'The world is insufficient, insatiable, a slave to craving': This
is the fourth Dhamma summary...
</p>
<p>"These, great king, are the four Dhamma summaries stated by the
Blessed One who knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened.
Having known &amp; seen &amp; heard them, I went forth from the home
life into homelessness."
</p>
<p>"Master Ratthapala, you say, 'The world is swept away. It does not
endure.' Now how is the meaning of this statement to be understood?"
</p>
<p>"What do you think, great king: When you were twenty or twenty-five
years old -- an expert elephant rider, an expert horseman, an expert
charioteer, an expert archer, an expert swordsman -- were you strong in
arm &amp; strong in thigh, fit, &amp; seasoned in warfare?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Ratthapala, when I was twenty or twenty-five years
old...I was strong in arm &amp; strong in thigh, fit, &amp; seasoned in
warfare. It was as if I had supernormal power. I do not see anyone who
was my equal in strength."
</p>
<p>"And what do you think, great king: Are you even now as strong in
arm &amp; strong in thigh, as fit, &amp; as seasoned in warfare?"
</p>
<p>"Not at all, Master Ratthapala. I'm now a feeble old man, aged,
advanced in years, having come to the last stage of life, 80 years old.
Sometimes, thinking, 'I will place my foot here,' I place it somewhere
else."
</p>
<p>"It was in reference to this, great king, that the Blessed One who
knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, said: 'The world
is swept away. It does not endure.' Having known &amp; seen &amp; heard
this, I went forth from the home life into homelessness."
</p>
<p>"It's amazing, Master Ratthapala. It's astounding, how well that has
been said by the Blessed One who knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly
self-awakened: 'The world is swept away. It does not endure.' For the
world really is swept away, Master Ratthapala. It does not endure.
</p>
<p>"Now, in this royal court there are elephant troops &amp; cavalry
&amp; chariot troops &amp; infantry that will serve to defend us from
dangers. And yet you say, 'The world is without shelter, without
protector.' How is the meaning of this statement to be understood?"
</p>
<p>"What do you think, great king: Do you have any recurring illness?"
</p>
<p>"Yes, Master Ratthapala, I have a recurring wind-illness. Sometimes
my friends &amp; advisors, relatives &amp; blood-kinsmen, stand around
me saying, 'This time King Koravya will die. This time King Koravya
will die.'"
</p>
<p>"And what do you think, great king: Can you say to your friends
&amp; advisors, relatives &amp; blood-kinsmen, 'My friends &amp;
advisors, relatives &amp; blood-kinsmen are commanded: all of you who
are present, share out this pain so that I may feel less pain'? Or do
you have to feel that pain all alone?"
</p>
<p>"Oh, no, Master Ratthapala, I can't say to my friends &amp;
advisors, relatives &amp; blood-kinsmen, 'All of you who are present,
share out this pain so that I may feel less pain.' I have to feel that
pain all alone."
</p>
<p>"It was in reference to this, great king, that the Blessed One who
knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, said: 'The world
is without shelter, without protector.' Having known &amp; seen &amp;
heard this, I went forth from the home life into homelessness."
</p>
<p>"It's amazing, Master Ratthapala. It's astounding, how well that has
been said by the Blessed One who knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly
self-awakened: 'The world is without shelter, without protector.' For
the world really is without shelter, Master Ratthapala. It is without
protector.
</p>
<p>"Now, in this royal court there is a great deal of gold &amp; silver
stashed away underground &amp; in attic vaults. And yet you say, 'The
world is without ownership. One has to pass on, leaving everything
behind.' How is the meaning of this statement to be understood?"
</p>
<p>"What do you think, great king? As you now enjoy yourself endowed
&amp; replete with the pleasures of the five senses, can you say, 'Even
in the afterlife I will enjoy myself in the same way, endowed &amp;
replete with the very same pleasures of the five senses'? Or will this
wealth fall to others, while you pass on in accordance with your
kamma?"
</p>
<p>"On, no, Master Ratthapala, I can't say, 'Even in the afterlife I
will enjoy myself in the same way, endowed &amp; replete with the very
same pleasures of the five senses.' This wealth will fall to others,
while I pass on in accordance with my kamma."
</p>
<p>"It was in reference to this, great king, that the Blessed One who
knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, said: 'The world
is without ownership. One has to pass on, leaving everything behind.'
Having known &amp; seen &amp; heard this, I went forth from the home
life into homelessness."
</p>
<p>"It's amazing, Master Ratthapala. It's astounding, how well that has
been said by the Blessed One who knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly
self-awakened: 'The world is without ownership. One has to pass on,
leaving everything behind.' For the world really is without ownership,
Master Ratthapala. One has to pass on, leaving everything behind.
</p>
<p>"Now, Master Ratthapala, you say, 'The world is insufficient,
insatiable, a slave to craving.' How is the meaning of this statement
to be understood?"
</p>
<p>"What do you think, great king: Do you now rule over the prosperous
country of <a name="kuru">Kuru</a>?"
</p>
<p>"That is so, Master Ratthapala. I rule over the prosperous country
of Kuru."
</p>
<p>"What do you think, great king: Suppose a trustworthy, reliable man
of yours were to come to you from the east. On arrival he would say to
you, 'May it please your majesty to know, I have come from the east.
There I saw a great country, powerful &amp; prosperous, populous &amp;
crowded with people. Plenty are the elephant troops there, plenty the
cavalry troops, chariot troops, &amp; infantry troops. Plenty is the
ivory-work there, plenty the gold &amp; silver, both worked &amp;
unworked. Plenty are the women for the taking. It is possible, with the
forces you now have, to conquer it. Conquer it, great king!' What would
you do?"
</p>
<p>"Having conquered it, Master Ratthapala, I would rule over it."
</p>
<p>"Now what do you think, great king? Suppose a trustworthy, reliable
man of yours were to come to you from the west...the north...the
south...the other side of the ocean. On arrival he would say to you,
'May it please your majesty to know, I have come from the other side of
the ocean. There I saw a great country, powerful &amp; prosperous,
populous &amp; crowded with people. Plenty are the elephant troops
there, plenty the cavalry troops, chariot troops, &amp; infantry
troops. Plenty is the ivory-work there, plenty the gold &amp; silver,
both worked &amp; unworked. Plenty are the women for the taking. It is
possible, with the forces you now have, to conquer it. Conquer it,
great king!' What would you do?"
</p>
<p>"Having conquered it, Master Ratthapala, I would rule over it, too."
</p>
<p>"It was in reference to this, great king, that the Blessed One who
knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly self-awakened, said: 'The world
is insufficient, insatiable, a slave to craving.' Having known &amp;
seen &amp; heard this, I went forth from the home life into
homelessness."
</p>
<p>"It's amazing, Master Ratthapala. It's astounding, how well that has
been said by the Blessed One who knows &amp; sees, worthy &amp; rightly
self-awakened: 'The world is insufficient, insatiable, a slave to
craving.' For the world really is insufficient, Master Ratthapala. It's
insatiable, a slave to craving."
</p>
<p>That is what Ven. Ratthapala said. Having said that, he further said
this:
</p>
<blockquote>I see in the world<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; people with wealth<br>
who, from delusion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; don't make a gift<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; of the treasure they've gained.<br>
Greedy, they stash it away,<br>
hoping for even more<br>
sensual pleasures.
  <p>A king who, by force,<br>
has conquered the world<br>
and rules over the earth<br>
to the edge of the sea,<br>
dissatisfied with the ocean's near shore,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; longs for the ocean's<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; far shore as well.
  </p>
  <p>Kings &amp; others<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- plenty of people -- <br>
go to death with craving<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; unabated. Unsated<br>
they leave the body behind,<br>
having not had enough<br>
of the world's sensual pleasures.
  </p>
  <p>One's relatives weep<br>
&amp; pull out their hair.<br>
'Oh woe, our loved one is dead,' they cry.<br>
Carrying him off,<br>
wrapped in a piece of cloth,<br>
they place him<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on a pyre,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then set him on fire.
  </p>
  <p>So he burns, poked with sticks,<br>
in just one piece of cloth,<br>
leaving all his possessions behind.<br>
They are not shelters for one who has died -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not relatives,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; friends,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or companions.
  </p>
  <p>His heirs take over his wealth,<br>
while the being goes on,<br>
in line with his kamma.<br>
No wealth at all<br>
follows the dead one -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; not children, wives,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dominion, or riches.
  </p>
  <p>Long life<br>
can't be gotten with wealth,<br>
nor aging<br>
warded off with treasure.<br>
The wise say this life<br>
is next to nothing -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; impermanent,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; subject to change.
  </p>
  <p>The rich &amp; the poor<br>
touch the touch of Death.<br>
The foolish &amp; wise<br>
are touched by it, too.<br>
But while fools lie as if slain by their folly,<br>
the wise don't tremble<br>
when touched by the touch.
  </p>
  <p>Thus the discernment by which<br>
one attains to mastery,<br>
is better than wealth -- <br>
for those who haven't reached mastery<br>
go from existence to existence,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; out of delusion,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; doing bad deeds.
  </p>
  <p>One goes to a womb<br>
&amp; to the next world,<br>
falling into the wandering on<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- one thing<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after another -- <br>
while those of weak discernment,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; trusting in one,<br>
also go to a womb<br>
&amp; to the next world.
  </p>
  <p>Just as an evil thief<br>
caught at the break-in<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is destroyed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by his own act,<br>
so evil people<br>
-- after dying, in the next world -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; are destroyed<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; by their own acts.
  </p>
  <p>Sensual pleasures -- <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; variegated,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; enticing,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sweet -- <br>
in various ways disturb the mind.<br>
Seeing the drawbacks in sensual objects:<br>
that's why, O king, I went forth.
  </p>
  <p>Just like fruits, people fall<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- young &amp; old -- <br>
at the break-up of the body.<br>
Knowing this, O king,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I went forth.<br>
The contemplative life is better<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; for sure.
  </p>
