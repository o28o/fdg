<p>.... Now at that time the Blessed One was sitting &amp; exchanging
courtesies &amp; conversation with some very senior brahmins. It so
happened that a brahmin student named <a name="kapadika">Kapadika</a>
was seated in the assembly: young, shaven-headed, sixteen years old, a
master of the Three Vedas with their vocabularies, liturgy, phonology,
&amp; etymologies, and the histories as a fifth; skilled in philology
&amp; grammar, well-versed in cosmology &amp; the marks of a great man.
While the very senior brahmins were conversing with the Blessed One, he
kept breaking in &amp; interrupting their talk. So the Blessed One
scolded him, "Venerable Bharadvaja, don't break in &amp; interrupt
while the very senior brahmins are conversing. Wait until they are
finished talking." </p>
<p>When this was said, the brahmin <a name="canki">Canki</a> said to
the Blessed One, "Master Gotama, don't scold the brahmin student
Kapadika. He is a clansman, learned, wise, with good delivery. He is
capable of taking part in this discussion with Master Gotama." </p>
<p>Then the thought occurred to the Blessed One, "Yes, this brahmin
student Kapadika must be accomplished in the texts of the Three Vedas,
inasmuch as the brahmins honor him so." </p>
<p>Then the thought occurred to Kapadika, "When Gotama the
contemplative meets my gaze with his, I will ask him a question." </p>
<p>And so the Blessed One, encompassing Kapadika's awareness with his
awareness, met his gaze. Kapadika thought, "Gotama the contemplative
has turned to me. Suppose I ask him a question." So he said to the
Blessed One, "Master Gotama, with regard to the ancient hymns of the
brahmins -- passed down through oral transmission &amp; included in
their canon -- the brahmins have come to the definite conclusion that
"Only this is true; anything else is worthless." What does Master
Gotama have to say to this?" </p>
<p>"Tell me, Bharadvaja, is there among the brahmins even one brahmin
who says, 'This I know; this I see; only this is true; anything else is
worthless?'" </p>
<p>"No, Master Gotama." </p>
<p>"And has there been among the brahmins even one teacher or teacher's
teacher back through seven generations who said, 'This I know; this I
see; only this is true; anything else is worthless?'" </p>
<p>"No, Master Gotama." </p>
<p>"And among the brahmin seers of the past, the creators of the hymns,
the composers of the hymns -- those ancient hymns, sung, repeated,
&amp; collected, which brahmins at present still sing, still chant,
repeating what was said, repeating what was spoken -- i.e., <a
 name="atthaka">Atthaka</a>, <a name="vamaka">Vamaka</a>, <a
 name="vamadeva">Vamadeva</a>, <a name="vessamitta">Vessamitta</a>, <a
 name="yamataggi">Yamataggi</a>, <a name="angirasa">Angirasa</a>, <a
 name="bharadvaja">Bharadvaja</a>, <a name="vasettha">Vasettha</a>, <a
 name="kassapa">Kassapa</a> &amp; <a name="bhagu">Bhagu</a>: was there
even one of these who said, 'This we know; this we see; only this is
true; anything else is worthless?'" </p>
<p>"No, Master Gotama." </p>
<p>"So then, Bharadvaja, it seems that there isn't among the brahmins
even one brahmin who says, 'This I know; this I see; only this is true;
anything else is worthless.' And there hasn't been among the brahmins
even one teacher or teacher's teacher back through seven generations
who said, 'This I know; this I see; only this is true; anything else is
worthless.' And there hasn't been among the brahmin seers of the past,
the creators of the hymns, the composers of the hymns ... even one who
said, 'This we know; this we see; only this is true; anything else is
worthless.' <a name="blind">Suppose</a> there were a row of blind men,
each holding on to the one in front of him: the first one doesn't see,
the middle one doesn't see, the last one doesn't see. In the same way,
the statement of the brahmins turns out to be a row of blind men, as it
were: the first one doesn't see, the middle one doesn't see, the last
one doesn't see. So what do you think, Bharadvaja: this being the case,
doesn't the conviction of the brahmins turn out to be groundless?" </p>
<p>"It's not only out of conviction, Master Gotama, that the brahmins
honor this. They also honor it as unbroken tradition." </p>
<p>"Bharadvaja, first you went by conviction. Now you speak of unbroken
tradition. There are five things that can turn out in two ways in the
here-&amp;-now. Which five? Conviction, liking, unbroken tradition,
reasoning by analogy, &amp; an agreement through pondering views. These
are the five things that can turn out in two ways in the
here-&amp;-now. Now some things are firmly held in conviction and yet
vain, empty, &amp; false. Some things are not firmly held in
conviction, and yet they are genuine, factual, &amp; unmistaken. Some
things are well-liked ... truly an unbroken tradition ... well-reasoned
... Some things are well-pondered and yet vain, empty, &amp; false.
Some things are not well-pondered, and yet they are genuine, factual,
&amp; unmistaken. In these cases it isn't proper for a knowledgeable
person who safeguards the truth to come to a definite conclusion, 'Only
this is true; anything else is worthless." </p>
<p>"But to what extent, Master Gotama, is there the safeguarding of the
truth? To what extent does one safeguard the truth? We ask Master
Gotama about the safeguarding of the truth." </p>
<p>"If a person has conviction, his statement, 'This is my conviction,'
safeguards the truth. But he doesn't yet come to the definite
conclusion that 'Only this is true; anything else is worthless.' To
this extent, Bharadvaja, there is the safeguarding of the truth. To
this extent one safeguards the truth. I describe this as the
safeguarding of the truth. But it is not yet an awakening to the truth.
</p>
<p>"If a person likes something ... holds an unbroken tradition ... has
something reasoned through analogy ... has something he agrees to,
having pondered views, his statement, 'This is what I agree to, having
pondered views,' safeguards the truth. But he doesn't yet come to the
definite conclusion that 'Only this is true; anything else is
worthless.' To this extent, Bharadvaja, there is the safeguarding of
the truth. To this extent one safeguards the truth. I describe this as
the safeguarding of the truth. But it is not yet an awakening to the
truth. </p>
<p>"Yes, Master Gotama, to this extent there is the safeguarding of the
truth. To this extent one safeguards the truth. We regard this as the
safeguarding of the truth. But to what extent is there an awakening to
the truth? To what extent does one awaken to the truth? We ask Master
Gotama about awakening to the truth." </p>
<p>"There is the case, Bharadvaja, where a monk lives in dependence on
a certain village or town. Then a householder or householder's son goes
to him and observes him with regard to three mental qualities --
qualities based on greed, qualities based on aversion, qualities based
on delusion: 'Are there in this venerable one any such qualities based
on greed that, with his mind overcome by these qualities, he might say,
"I know," while not knowing, or say, "I see," while not seeing; or that
he might urge another to act in a way that was for his/her long-term
harm &amp; pain?' As he observes him, he comes to know, 'There are in
this venerable one no such qualities based on greed .... His bodily
behavior &amp; verbal behavior are those of one not greedy. And the
Dhamma he teaches is deep, hard to see, hard to realize, tranquil,
refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle, to-be-experienced by
the wise. This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a person who's greedy. </p>
<p>When, on observing that the monk is purified with regard to
qualities based on greed, he next observes him with regard to qualities
based on aversion: 'Are there in this venerable one any such qualities
based on aversion that, with his mind overcome by these qualities, he
might say, "I know," while not knowing, or say, "I see," while not
seeing; or that he might urge another to act in a way that was for
his/her long-term harm &amp; pain?' As he observes him, he comes to
know, 'There are in this venerable one no such qualities based on
aversion .... His bodily behavior &amp; verbal behavior are those of
one not aversive. And the Dhamma he teaches is deep, hard to see, hard
to realize, tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle,
to-be-experienced by the wise. This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a
person who's aversive. </p>
<p>When, on observing that the monk is purified with regard to
qualities based on aversion, he next observes him with regard to
qualities based on delusion: 'Are there in this venerable one any such
qualities based on delusion that, with his mind overcome by these
qualities, he might say, "I know," while not knowing, or say, "I see,"
while not seeing; or that he might urge another to act in a way that
was for his/her long-term harm &amp; pain?' As he observes him, he
comes to know, 'There are in this venerable one no such qualities based
on delusion .... His bodily behavior &amp; verbal behavior are those of
one not deluded. And the Dhamma he teaches is deep, hard to see, hard
to realize, tranquil, refined, beyond the scope of conjecture, subtle,
to-be-experienced by the wise. This Dhamma can't easily be taught by a
person who's deluded. </p>
<p>When, on observing that the monk is purified with regard to
qualities based on delusion, he places conviction in him. With the
arising of conviction, he visits him &amp; grows close to him. Growing
close to him, he lends ear. Lending ear, he hears the Dhamma. Hearing
the Dhamma, he remembers it. Remembering it, he penetrates the meaning
of those dhammas. Penetrating the meaning, he comes to an agreement
through pondering those dhammas. There being an agreement through
pondering those dhammas, desire arises. With the arising of desire, he
becomes willing. Willing, he contemplates (lit: "weighs," "compares").
Contemplating, he makes an exertion. Exerting himself, he both realizes
the ultimate meaning of the truth with his body and sees by penetrating
it with discernment. </p>
<p>"To this extent, Bharadvaja, there is an awakening to the truth. To
this extent one awakens to the truth. I describe this as an awakening
to the truth. But it is not yet the final attainment of the truth. </p>
<p>"Yes, Master Gotama, to this extent there is an awakening to the
truth. To this extent one awakens to the truth. We regard this as an
awakening to the truth. But to what extent is there the final
attainment of the truth? To what extent does one finally attain the
truth? We ask Master Gotama about the final attainment of the truth." </p>
<p>"The cultivation, development, &amp; pursuit of those very same
qualities: to this extent, Bharadvaja, there is the final attainment of
the truth. To this extent one finally attains the truth. I describe
this as the final attainment of the truth." </p>
<p>"Yes, Master Gotama, to this extent there is the final attainment of
the truth. To this extent one finally attains the truth. We regard this
as the final attainment of the truth. But what quality is most helpful
for the final attainment of the truth? We ask Master Gotama about the
quality most helpful for the final attainment of the truth." </p>
<p>"<a name="exertion">Exertion</a> is most helpful for the final
attainment of the truth, Bharadvaja. If one didn't make an exertion,
one wouldn't finally attain the truth. Because one makes an exertion,
one finally attains the truth. Therefore, exertion is most helpful for
the final attainment of the truth." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for exertion? We ask Master Gotama
about the quality most helpful for exertion." </p>
<p>"Contemplating is most helpful for exertion, Bharadvaja. If one
didn't contemplate, one wouldn't make an exertion. Because one
contemplates, one makes an exertion. Therefore, contemplating is most
helpful for exertion." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for contemplating? ..." </p>
<p>"Being willing .... If one weren't willing, one wouldn't contemplate
...." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for being willing? ..." </p>
<p>"Desire .... If desire didn't arise, one wouldn't be willing ...." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for desire? ..." </p>
<p>"Coming to an agreement through pondering dhammas .... If one didn't
come to an agreement through pondering dhammas, desire wouldn't arise
...." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for coming to an agreement through
pondering dhammas? ..." </p>
<p>"Penetrating the meaning .... If one didn't penetrate the meaning,
one wouldn't come to an agreement through pondering dhammas ...." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for penetrating the meaning? ...."
</p>
<p>"Remembering the Dhamma .... If one didn't remember the Dhamma, one
wouldn't penetrate the meaning ...." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for remembering the Dhamma? ... " </p>
<p>"Hearing the Dhamma .... If one didn't hear the Dhamma, one wouldn't
remember the Dhamma ...." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for hearing the Dhamma? ... " </p>
<p>"Lending ear .... If one didn't lend ear, one wouldn't hear the
Dhamma ...." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for lending ear? ... " </p>
<p>"Growing close .... If one didn't grow close, one wouldn't lend ear
...." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for growing close? ... " </p>
<p>"Visiting .... If one didn't visit, one wouldn't grow close ...." </p>
<p>"But what quality is most helpful for visiting? We ask Master Gotama
about the quality most helpful for visiting." </p>
<p>"Conviction is most helpful for visiting, Bharadvaja. If conviction
[in a person] didn't arise, one wouldn't visit [that person]. Because
conviction arises, one visits. Therefore, conviction is most helpful
for visiting." </p>
<p>"We have asked Master Gotama about safeguarding the truth, and
Master Gotama has answered about safeguarding the truth. We like that
&amp; agree with that, <a name="BM1">[</a><a href="#n1">1</a>] and so
we are gratified. We have asked Master Gotama about awakening to the
truth, and Master Gotama has answered about awakening to the truth. We
like that &amp; agree with that, and so we are gratified. We have asked
Master Gotama about finally attaining the truth, and Master Gotama has
answered about finally attaining the truth. We like that &amp; agree
with that, and so we are gratified. We have asked Master Gotama about
the quality most helpful for finally attaining the truth, and Master
Gotama has answered about the quality most helpful for finally
attaining the truth. We like that &amp; agree with that, and so we are
gratified. Whatever we have asked Master Gotama, Master Gotama has
answered it. We like that &amp; agree with that, and so we are
gratified. </p>
<p>"We used to think, 'Who are these bald-headed "contemplatives,"
these menial, dark offspring of [Brahma] the Kinsman's feet? <a
 name="BM2">[</a><a href="#n2">2</a>] Who are they to know the Dhamma?'
But now Master Gotama has inspired within us a contemplative-love for
contemplatives, a contemplative-confidence in contemplatives, a
contemplative-respect for contemplatives. <a name="magnif">Magnificent</a>,
Master Gotama! Magnificent! In many ways has Master Gotama made the
Dhamma clear -- just as if he were to place upright what has been
overturned, to reveal what has been hidden, to point out the way to one
who is lost, or to set out a lamp in the darkness so that those with
eyes might see forms. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma,
&amp; to the community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay
follower who has gone for refuge from this day forward, for life." </p>
