</I>(126) To Venerable Bh&aring;mija</P>
</B><P>I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One lived in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in R&agrave;jagaha. Venerable Bh&aring;mija put on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes approached the home of prince Jayasena and sat on the prepared seat. Then prince Jayasena approached venerable Bh&aring;nija, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said. `Good Bh&aring;mija, there are recluses and brahmins who hold this view and declare it.

<FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P><A NAME="n1"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#BM1">1</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] Without right and true insight, leading the holy life with attachment, it is not possible to attain some distinction (<I>&acirc;sa¤ ce pi karitv&agrave; ayoniso brahmacariya&uuml; carati, abhabbo phalassa adhigam&agrave;ya</I>). The complete sutta tells us that leading the holy life should be with right and true insight. i.e., The one leading the holy life should know for what purpose he is doing so. He should correctly understand the acutely unsatisfactory nature of life, and so make an effort to achieve a distincton above human. So then he should arouse effort to attain that distinction not yet attained.</P>
