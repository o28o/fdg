</I>(137) Classification of the Six Spheres</P>
</B><P>I heard thus. The Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&iuml;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there. `Bhikkhus, I will teach the Classification of the six spheres, listen attentively,</P>
<P>I will teach' Those bhikkhus agreed and the Blessed One said `Bhikkhus, you should know, the six internal spheres, the six external spheres, the six bodies of consciousness, the six bodies of contact, the eighteen ramblings of the mind and the thirty six in seven steps. Here on account of this dispel this. When the noble disciple develops, the three establishments of mindfulness, he becomes a Teacher suitable to instruct a gathering. He is said to be the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed. This is the short exposition of the classification of the six mental spheres.</P>
<P>It was said, that the six internal spheres should be known. Why was it said so? The spheres of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and the mind should be known. If it was said the six internal spheres should be known, it was said, on account of this.</P>
<P>It was said, that the six external spheres should be known. Why was it said so? The spheres of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, touches and ideas should be known. If it was said the six external spheres should be known, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>It was said, that the six conscious bodies should be known. Why was it said so? The conscious bodies of the eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and the mind should be known. If it was said the six conscious bodies should be known, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>It was said, that the six bodies of contact should be known. Why was it said so? The bodies of contact of the, eye, ear, nose, tongue, body and the mind should be known. If it was said the six bodies of contact should be known, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>It was said that the eighteen ramblings of the mind should be known. Why was it said so? Seeing a form with the eye, the mind dwells in pleasure, dwells in displeasure, and dwells in equanimity; Hearing a sound, ... re ... . Smelling ascent, ... re ... Tasting, ... re ... . Experiencing a touch ... re ... Cognizing an idea dwells in pleasure dwells in displeasure and dwells in equanimity. Thus there are six ramblings in pleasure, six in displeasure and six in equanimity If it was said the eighteen ramblings of the mindshould be known, it was said on account of this.</P>
<P>It was said that the thirty six should be known, in seven steps. Why was it said so?</P>
<P>The six clingings to worldly pleasures, the six clingings to non -sensual pleasures, the six clingings to worldly displeasures, the six clingings to non-sensual displeasures, the six clingings to worldly equanimities, and the six clingings to non-sensual equanimities.</P>
<P>What are the six clingings to worldly pleasures? Pleasing agreeable forms that should be cognized with eye consciousess, arousing delight connected with material gains, or with material gains in the past, which changed, are no more and are only the recollections of the past, which arouse pleasure, to these are said clingings to worldly pleasures.

These. are the six clingings to worldly pleasures</P>
<P>What are the six clingings to non sensual pleasures?

Knowing as it really is that all forms are impermanent, changing, unpleasant things, in the past as well as now with right wisdom, desires for the incomparable release. `When will I abide in that sphere, in which the noble ones at present abide,' On account of that desire arises displeasure. That displeasure is called, clinging to non-sensual displeasure. Knowing as it really is that all sounds . re ... Knowing as it really is that all smells ... re.

<P>What are the six clingings to worldly equanimity? The not learned ordinary man, who has not won over, the boundary and the results of actions and who does not see the dangers, seeing a form gains equanimity, that equanimity does not leap beyond that form, therefore it is said clinging to worldly equanimity.

To see matter in matter is to be aware of whatever matters at one or the other of our six doors of mental contact. It's for the purpose of cutting short our long journey in existences, by penetratingly seeing the unsatisfactory nature of existences. This is one of the methods to attain the paths and fruits.</P>

The immaterial perceptions are attained to, by attaining to the jh&agrave;nas, or with the help of other meditation objects.</P>
