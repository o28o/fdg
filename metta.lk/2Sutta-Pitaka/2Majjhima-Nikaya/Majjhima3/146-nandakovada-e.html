</I>(146) Advice from Venerable Nandaka</P>
</B><P>I heard thus.</P>
<P>At one time the Blessed One lived in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika, in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>Then Mahapaj&agrave;pati Gotami approached the Blessed One with about five hundred bhikkhunis. They worshipped the Blessed One and stood on a side, and Mahapajapati Gotami said to the Blessed One. `Venerable sir, advise the bhikkhunis, give them a talk on the Teaching.&ucirc;</P>
<P>At that time the elder bhikkhus were advising the bhikkhunis in turns. Venerable Nandaka did not like to advise the bhikkhunis when his turn came. The Blessed One then addressed venerable &acirc;nanda. `&acirc;nanda. who will advise the bhikkhunis today?' `Venerable sir, it is venerable Nandaka's turn and he does not like to advise the bhikkhunis,' The Blessed One then addressed venerable Nandaka. `Nandaka, advise the bhikkhunis. Holy man, give the bhikkhunis a talk on the Teaching.' <A NAME="BM1"></A>[</FONT><A HREF="#n1">1</A><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+">] Venerable Nandaka agreed and the next moring, putting on robes and taking bowl and robes went the alms round in S&agrave;vatthi. After collecting alms and when the meal was over, approached the monastery of the royal women. The bhikkhunis seeing venerable Nandaka approach prepared a seat and administered water to wash the feet. Venerable Nandaka sat on the prepared seat and washed his feet. The bhikkhunis too worshipped venerable Nandaka and sat on a side. Then venerable Nandaka said to those bhikkhunis. `Sisters, there will be a session of asking questions and replying them. Those who know should say, I know and those who do not know should say I do not know. When there is doubt or consternation, it should be asked from me, venerable sir, what is the meaning of this.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Even while hearing this announcement, of venerable Nandaka we are pleased and happy.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Sisters, is the eye permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Impermanent. Venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That which is impermanent, is it unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>

Is that said correctly?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is not well said, because, on account of this and other reason, there arises this and other feeling and when that reason subsides, the respective feeling fades.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good! Sisters, that is so. It is the noble disciple that sees it, as it really is with right wisdom.&ucirc;</P>

<P>&szlig;Sisters, a clever butcher or his apprentice would kill a cow with a sharp carving knife, and would chop it into small bits without hindering the internal flesh or the external skin. He would chop all the internal tissues, veins and ligaments, into small bits, as they stand and would put the cow together in the outer skin as it was and would say. This is the same cow complete in that same skin. Sisters, is that said correctly?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is not so, because, that clever butcher or his apprentice would kill a cow with a sharp carving knife, and would chop it into small bits without hindering the internal flesh or the external skin.

This is the same cow complete in that same skin. Yet, that cow is unyoked from the skin.&ucirc;</P>

<P>Venerable Nandaka advising the bhikkhunis in this manner said. `Sisters, go now, it's late,' And sent them away.</P>
<P>&szlig;Those bhikkhunis, delighting, hearing the words of venerable Nandaka, got up from their seats, worshipped him, going away respectfully with their right sides towards venerable Nandaka approached the Blessed One, worshipped the Blessed One and kept standing. The Blessed One said. `Sisters, go now, it's late,' Those bhikkhunis worshipped the Blessed One and went away respectfully with their right sides towards the Blessed One. When the bhikkhunis had gone away the Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus. `Bhikkhus, Many people seeing the moon on the fourteenth day of waxing, do not entertain doubts such as is the moon incomplete or not, but that it is incomplete. In the same manner, the bhikkhunis are delighted hearing the Teaching, but their aims are not fulfilled.</P>
<P>Then the Blessed One addressed venerable Nandaka. `Therefore, Nandaka, advise the bhikkhus, on that same topic again.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Venerable Nandaka agreed, and at the end of that night, the next morning putting on robes and taking bowl and robes went the alms round in S&agrave;vatthi.

They know that the moon is complete. In the same manner, the bhikkhunis are delighted hearing Nandaka's preaching, and their aims are fulfilled. The least of those five hundred bhikkhunis is a stream entrant, not falling from that, is aiming extinctlion.</P>
<P>The Blessed One said that and those bhikkhusdelighted in the words of the Blessed One.</P>

This is also called the release through knowing here and now. The living worthy ones `arahant&agrave;' enjoy this bliss of not being touched by any of the contacts at any of the doors of mental contact. Should be something very pleasant.
