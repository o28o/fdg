<P>Bhikkhus, on account of eye and forms arises eye-consciousness, inter action of the three is contact. On account of a contact arises feelings, pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Someone touched by a pleasant feeling, delights, welcomes and gets bound by it and the latent tendency to greed streams down to him. Touched by an unpleasant feeling, grieves, worries, wails, beats the breast and comes to bewilderment and the latent tendency to anger streams down to him. Touched by neither an unpleasant nor pleasant feeling, does not know the arising, fading, satisfaction, danger and giving up of that feeling, as it really is, and the latent tendency to ignore streams down to him. Bhikkhus, it is not possible that he should end unpleasantness, here and now without dispelling ignorance and arousing science by dispelling the latent tendency to greed for pleasant feelings, the latent tendency to be angry for unpleasant feelings and the latent tendency to ignore neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings.</P>

<P>Bhikkhus, the noble disciple reflecting thus turns away from eye, forms, eye-consciousness, eye contact, feelings and craving. Turns away from ear, sounds, ear-consciousness, ear contact, feelings and craving. Turns away from nose, scents, nose-consciousness, nose contact, feelings and craving. Turns away from tongue, tastes, tongue-consciousness, tongue contact, feelings and craving. Turns away from body, touches, body-consciousness, body contact, feelings and craving. Turns away from mind, thoughts, mind-consciousness, mind contact, feelings and craving. Turning the mind away detaches it and releases it. Then knowledge arises, I'm released, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done there is nothing more to wish.</P>
<P>The Blessed One said thus. Those bhikkhus delighted in the words of the Blessed One. When this Teaching was given the minds of about sixty bhikkhus were released.</P>
