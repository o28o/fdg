(116) Lokakamaguna 1 &Yacute; The Five Strands of Sensuality in the World 1</P>
</B><P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living with his relations in a house of bricks and addressed the monks from there:</P>
<P>2. &szlig;Monks, I do not say the knowing, seeing achieving, end of the world is reached by traveling, , nor do I declare the ending of unpleasantness without reaching the end of the world.&ucirc; The Blessed One saying these words got up from his seat and entered his dwelling.</P>
<P>3. Soon after the Blessed One had gone away it occurred to those monks: `Here, friends, the Blessed One has given the gist of this exposition and without giving its details got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. `Monks, I do not say the knowing, seeing achieving, end of the world is reached by traveling, nor do I declare the ending of unpleasantness without reaching the end of the world.' Who would explain the detailed meaning of this short exposition'</P>
<P>4. Then it occurred to those monks: &szlig;There is venerable &acirc;nanda. He is even praised by the Teacher as a well developed and wise one, among the co-associates in the holy life. It is possible for him to explain this short exposition given by the Blessed One. What if we approach venerable &acirc;nanda and ask him to explain this?&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. Then those monks approached venerable &acirc;nanda, exchanged friendly greetings and sat on side.</P>
<P>6. Sitting those monks said to venerable &acirc;nanda: &szlig;Friend, &acirc;nanda, the Blessed One gave us the gist of this exposition and without giving its details got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. `Monks, I do not say the knowing, seeing achieving end of the world is reached by traveling, nor do I declare the ending of unpleasantness without reaching the end of the world.'

<P>7. &szlig;Friends, you coming face to face with the Teacher should ignore him and ask me to explain this is like the work of a man in search of heartwood, coming to a standing tree full of heartwood, ignoring the root and the trunk and think to search for the essence among the branches and leaves. Friends, the Blessed One knows what should be known, sees what should be seen, is one with sight, is wise, is the Teaching, has become Brahma. Friends, the Thus Gone One observes what he preaches, gives the essential, is giver of the deathless, the leader for the Teaching. This is the right time to ask the Blessed One, himself and as the Blessed One explains it, bear it in your minds.</P>
<P>8. Indeed friend, &acirc;nanda, the Blessed One knows what should be known, sees what should be seen, is one with sight, is wise, is the Teaching, he has become Brahma. Friend, the Thus Gone One observes what he preaches, gives the essential, is giver of the deathless, is the leader for the Teaching.

Of this short exposition of the Blessed One I know the detailed meaning thus:</P>
<P>11. Friends, by whatever means there are perceptions of the world and measuring in the world that is the world in the dispensation of the noble ones. Friends, through what are there perceptions of the world and measuring in the world? Friends, through the eye, one perceives and there is measuring in the world. Through the ear, nose, tongue, body and the mind there are perceptions and measuring in the world. This is the world in the dispensation of the noble ones.</P>
<P>12. Friends, the Blessed One gave you the gist of this exposition, without giving its details got up from his seat and entered his dwelling. `Monks, I do not say the knowing, seeing achieving end of the world, is reached by traveling, nor do I declare the ending of unpleasantness without reaching the end of the world.'

<P>&szlig;That is not so, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Rahula, the noble disciple seeing it thus turns from the eye, forms, and eye-contact. &#57389; re &#57389; Turns from the mind, ideas, mind-consciousness, mind-contact and whatever feelings pleasant, unpleasant, or neither unpleasant nor pleasant born of mind-contact. Turning loses interest, not interested is released. Released knowledge arises to him, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, duties are done, I have nothing more to wish.&ucirc;</P>
<P>13. The Blessed One said thus and venerable Rahula delighted in the words of the Blessed One. When this discourse was given venerable Rahula's mind was released from desires without holdings and the stainless eye of the Teaching arose to an innumerable number of thousands of heavenly beings; `Whatever things are of the nature of arising are also of the nature of ceasing.'<BR>
