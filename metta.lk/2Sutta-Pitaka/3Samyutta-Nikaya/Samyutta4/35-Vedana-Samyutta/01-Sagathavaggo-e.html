(6) Sallattena &Yacute; With a Pricked Self</P>
</B><P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living with the Sakyas in Gosita's monastery in Kapilavatthu</P>
<P>2. From there the Blessed One addressed the monks:</P>
<P>3. &szlig;Monks, the not learned ordinary man feels pleasant, unpleasant and neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings.</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Monks, the learned noble disciple too feels pleasant, unpleasant and neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings.</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Then monks, what is the difference, distinction and excellence between the learned noble disciple and the not learned ordinary man?&ucirc;</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Venerable sir, the lead to the Teaching is from the Blessed One. Hearing it from the Blessed One the monks will bear it in their minds.&ucirc;</P>
<P>7. &szlig;Monks, the not learned ordinary man touched by unpleasant feelings grieves, wearies, wails, beats the breast and comes to bewilderment of mind. He feels for two feelings bodily and mental.</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Like a man pricked by an arrow, is pricked by a second arrow and feels for two pricks. In the same manner the not learned ordinary man touched by unpleasant feelings grieves, wearies, wails, beats the breast and comes to bewilderment of mind. He feels for two feelings bodily and mental. Touched by those same unpleasant feelings he becomes repulsive, as a result repulsive latent tendencies stream to him. When touched by unpleasant feelings he enjoys sensual pleasures. What is the reason? Monks, the not learned ordinary man does not know the escape from unpleasant feelings other than by enjoying sensual pleasures. When enjoying sensual pleasures, the latent tendency to greed for pleasant feelings, stream to him. He does not know as it really is the arising, fading, satisfaction, danger and the escape from those feelings. As a result the latent tendency to ignore, neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings, streams to him. As a result, he feels pleasant feelings tied to them, feels unpleasant feelings tied to them and feels neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings tied to them. Monks, to this it is said, the not learned ordinary man is tied to birth, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. I say he is tied to unpleasantness.</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Monks, the learned noble disciple touched by unpleasant feelings does not grieve, is not wearied, does not wail, beat the breast and come to bewilderment of mind. He feels for one feeling, only bodily feelings and not for mental feelings.</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Like a man pricked by an arrow, is not pricked by a second arrow and feels for one prick. In the same manner the learned noble disciple touched by unpleasant feelings does not grieve, is not wearied, does not wail, beat the breast and come to bewilderment of mind. He feels for one feeling, only bodily feelings and not mental feelings Touched by those same unpleasant feelings he does not become repulsive and repulsive latent tendencies do not stream to him. When touched by unpleasant feelings he does not enjoy sensual pleasures. What is the reason? Monks, the learned noble disciple knows the escape from unpleasant feelings, other than by enjoying sensual pleasures. When he does not enjoy sensual pleasures, the latent tendency, to greed for pleasant feelings do not stream to him. He knows as it really is the arising, fading, satisfaction, danger and the escape from those feelings. As a result the latent tendency to ignore, neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings do not stream to him. As a result, he feels pleasant feelings not tied to them, feels unpleasant feelings not tied to them and feels neither unpleasant nor pleasant feelings not tied to them. Monks, to this it is said, the learned noble disciple is not tied to birth, death, grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress. I say he is not tied to unpleasantness.</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Monks, this is the discrimination, peculiarity and the difference of the learned noble disciple and the not learned ordinary man.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The wise do not feel for pleasant, <BR>
unpleasant or the highly appeased feelings<BR>
This is the most prominent and clever difference <BR>
between the wise one and the ordinary man.</P>
<P>The minds of the learned, who have mastered<BR>
The Truth of this and the other world<BR>
Are not happy for pleasant things<BR>
Or disturbed about unpleasant things.</P>
<P>The clamoring and the opposition<BR>
Scattered and faded are not evident,<BR>
They thoroughly know the end of `being',<BR>
Is the stainless, non grieving state; extinction.&ucirc;<BR>
