</B><P>1. At one time the Blessed One lived in the gabled hall in the Great Forest in Vesali.</P>
<P>2. Then a certain monk approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on side</P>
<P>3. Sitting on a side that monk said to the Blessed One: &szlig;Venerable sir, when I was in my seclusion, this thought process arose to me. Three feelings are pointed out by the Blessed One; as pleasant, unpleasant and neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Further it was said by the Blessed One, that whatever is felt is unpleasant. Venerable sir, for what reason was it said that whatever is felt is unpleasant?</P>
<P>4. &szlig;Excellent monk! These three feelings are pointed out by me; as pleasant, unpleasant and neither unpleasant nor pleasant. Further I have said that whatever is felt is unpleasant. Monk, I have said this on account of the destructive, fading, losing interest, ceasing and changing nature of intentions.</P>
<P>5. &szlig;Thus, monk I have declared the gradual cessation of intentions. To one in the first higher stage of the mind words cease. To one in the second higher stage of the mind thoughts and thought processes cease. To one in the third higher stage of the mind the emotion of joy ceases. To one in the fourth higher stage of the mind in and out breathing cease. To one attained to the sphere of space perceptions of matter cease. To one attained to the sphere of consciousness perceptions of space cease. To one attained to the sphere of nothingness perceptions of consciousness cease. To one attained to the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception the perceptions of nothingness cease. To one attained to the cessation of perceptions and feelings perceptions and feelings cease. To the monk who has destroyed desires, greed, hate and delusion cease.</P>
<P>6. &szlig;Thus, monk I have declared the gradual calming of intentions. To one in the first higher stage of mind words are calmed. To one in the second higher stage of mind thoughts and thought processes are calmed. To one in the third higher stage of mind the emotion of joy is calmed. To one in the fourth higher stage of mind in and out breathing is calmed. To one attained to the sphere of space perceptions of matter are calmed.

To one in the third higher stage of mind emotions of joy are reposed.

<P>11. &szlig;&acirc;nanda, these are the five strands of sense pleasures such as welcome pleasant forms cognizable by eye-consciousness, welcome pleasant sounds cognizable by ear-consciousness welcome pleasant scents cognizable by nose-consciousness, welcome pleasant tastes cognizable by tongue-consciousness and welcome pleasant touches cognizable by body-consciousness. &acirc;nanda, the pleasantness and pleasure that arise on account of these five strands of sense pleasure is called sense pleasure.</P>
<P>12. &szlig;&acirc;nanda, if someone would say this is the highest pleasure and pleasantness that beings feel I say, it is not so, I do not approve it. What is the reason? &acirc;nanda, there is a pleasantness that goes beyond this and is more exalted. &acirc;nanda, what is that pleasantness which goes beyond this and is more exalted than this? Here, &acirc;nanda, the monk, secluding the mind from sensual pleasures and demerit, with thoughts and thought processes and with emotions of joy arising from seclusion, abides in the first higher stage of mind. &acirc;nanda, this is a pleasantness that goes beyond and is exalted than the aforesaid&#57389;</P>

The monk abides in this third higher stage of mind. This goes beyond and is exalted, than the aforesaid.</P>

Friends, in whatever manner pleasantness is gained, in this and other instance, there it was pointed out as pleasant'.&ucirc;<BR>
