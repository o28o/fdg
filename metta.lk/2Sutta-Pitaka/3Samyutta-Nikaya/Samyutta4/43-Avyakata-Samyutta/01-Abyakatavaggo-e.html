(1) Khem&agrave; Theri &Yacute; Theri Khema</P>
</B><P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thap&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi.</P>
<P>2. At that time bhikkhuni Khema was touring the country of Kosala and arriving in the region of Torana between S&agrave;vatthi and Saketa, observed the rains in Torana.</P>
<P>3. King Pasenadi of Kosala too going from Saketa to S&agrave;vatthi, arrived in Torana and wanted to spend one night in Torana</P>
<P>4. King Pasenadi of Kosala addressed a certain man and said &szlig;Good one do you know of a suitable recluse or Brahmin in Torana whom I could associate today?&ucirc;</P>
<P>That man offering to find a recluse or Brahmin for the king to associate for one day, wandered all over Torana and did not find one.</P>
<P>5. He came across bhikkhuni Khema who had observed the rains in Torana .and approaching king Pasenadia of Kosala informed the king: &szlig;Lord, I could not find a suitable recluse or Brahmin with whom your majesty could associate. Yet there is a bhikkhuni called Khema. She is a disciple of the Blessed One, worthy and rightfully enlightened. Lord, of this lady a good name has spread. She is learned and wise, is a good teacher who could explain the Teaching well. Lord you may associate her.&ucirc;</P>
<P>6. Then king Pasenadi of Kosala approached bhikkhuni Khema, worshipped and sat on aside.</P>
<P>7. Sitting on a side, king pasenadi of Kosala said: &szlig;Lady, the Thus Gone One is, after death?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Great king, it is not declared by the Blessed One, `the Thus Gone One is, after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>8. &szlig;Lady, the Thus Gone One is not after death?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Great king, it is also not declared by the Blessed One,`the Thus Gone One is not after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>9. &szlig;Lady, `the Thus Gone One is and is not after death'?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Great king, it is also not declared by the Blessed One, `the Thus Gone One is and is not after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Lady, the Thus Gone One is not after death and neither not after death &ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Great king, it is also not declared by the Blessed One `the Thus Gone One is not and is neither not, after death.&ucirc;</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Lady, when it was asked, is the Thus Gone One after death, it was said, Great king, it is not declared by the Blessed One, the Thus Gone One is, after death. When asked, is the Thus Gone One not after death, it was said, Great king, it is also not declared by the Blessed One the Thus Gone One is not after death. When asked is the Thus Gone One is and is not after death, it was said, Great king, it is also not declared by the Blessed One, the Thus Gone One is and is not after death. When asked, is the Thus Gone One not and neither not after death, it was said, great king, it was also not declared by the Blessed One `the Thus Gone One is not and neither not after death. Lady, what is the reason that these, were not declared by the Blessed One?&ucirc;</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Great king, I will cross question you on this same and you could explain as it pleases you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Great king, do you have a mathematician or an accountant who could calculate the sand at the bottom of river Ganges, as it is this much sand, so many hundreds of sand, or so many thousands of sand or so many hundred thousands of sand?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, Lady, there isn't one who could.&ucirc;</P>
<P>14. &szlig;Great king, do you have a mathematician or an accountant who could calculate the water in the ocean as it is this number of vessels of water, this number of hundreds of vessels of water, or this number of thousands of vessels of water or this number of hundred thousands of vessels of water?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, Lady, there isn't one who could.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;What is the reason?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Lady, the great ocean is deep, immeasurable and difficult to measure!&ucirc;</P>
<P>15. &szlig;Great king, in the same manner with whatever matter the Thus Gone One is pointed out, that matter, the Thus Gone has dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made a palm stump and made not to grow in the future. Great king, the Thus Gone One, deep, immeasurable and difficult to fathom is released from the enumerations of matter, just as the great ocean is. Therefore, the Thus Gone One is after death does not apply, is not after death does not apply, is and is not after death does not apply and the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death does not apply.</P>
<P>16. &szlig;With whatever feelings the Thus Gone One is pointed out, those feelings the Thus Gone has dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made a palm stump and made not to grow in the future. Great king, the Thus Gone One, deep, immeasurable and difficult to fathom is released from the enumeration of feelings, just as the great ocean is. Therefore, the Thus Gone One is after death does not apply, is not after death does not apply, is and is not after death does not apply and the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death does not apply.</P>
<P>17. &szlig;With whatever perceptions the Thus Gone One is pointed out, those perceptions the Thus Gone has dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made a palm stump and made not to grow in the future. Great king, the Thus Gone One, deep, immeasurable and difficult to fathom is released from the enumeration of perceptions, just as the great ocean is. Therefore, the Thus Gone One is after death does not apply, is not after death, does not apply, is and is not after death does not apply and the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death does not apply.</P>
<P>18. &szlig;With whatever determinants the Thus Gone One is pointed out, those determinants the Thus Gone has dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made a palm stump and made not to grow in the future. Great king, the Thus Gone One, deep, immeasurable and difficult to fathom is released from the enumeration of determinants just as the great ocean is. Therefore, the Thus Gone One is after death does not apply, is not after death does not apply, is and is not after death does not apply and the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death does not apply.</P>
<P>19. &szlig;With whatever consciousness the Thus Gone One is pointed out, that consciousness the Thus Gone has dispelled, pulled out with the roots, made a palm stump and made not to grow in the future. Great king, the Thus Gone One, deep, immeasurable and difficult to fathom is released from the enumeration of consciousness just as the great ocean is. Therefore, the Thus Gone One is after death does not apply, is not after death does not apply, is and is not after death does not apply and the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death does not apply.&ucirc;</P>
<P>20. Then king Pasenadi of Kosala agreeing and delighting in the words of bhikkhuni Khema got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated bhikkhuni Khema and wwent away.</P>
<P>21. In the meantime king Pasenadi of Kosala approached the Blessed One worshipped and sat on aside.</P>
<P>22. Sitting on a side, king pasenadi of Kosala said: &szlig;Venerable sir, the Thus Gone One is, after death?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Great king, it is not declared by me `the Thus Gone One is, after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>23. &szlig;Venerable sir, the Thus Gone One is not after death?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Great king, it is also not declared by me `the Thus Gone One is not after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>24. &szlig;Venerable sir, `the Thus Gone One is and is not after death'?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Great king, it is also not declared by me, `the Thus Gone One is and is not after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>25. &szlig;Venerable sir, the Thus Gone One is not and neither not after death &ucirc;</P>

Venerable sir, what is the reason that these, were not declared by the Blessed One?&ucirc;</P>
<P>27. &szlig;Great king, I will cross question you on this same and you could explain as it pleases you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>28. &szlig;Great king, do you have a mathematician or an accountant who could calculate the sand at the bottom of river Ganges, as it is this much sand, so many hundreds of sand, or so many thousands of sand or so many hundred thousands of sand?&ucirc;</P>

<P>35. &szlig;Venerable sir, it is wonderful and surprising, a female disciple of the Teacher has expressed the same meaning with the same words and phrases not deviating from the main theme.</P>
<P>36. &szlig;Venerable sir, at one time I approached bhikkhuni Khema and asked this same question and that lady explained the meaning with these same words and phrases that the Blessed One has explained. Venerable sir, it is wonderful and surprising, a female disciple of the Teacher has expressed the same meaning with the same words and phrases not deviating from the main theme.

<P>&szlig;Great king, do the fitting thing.&ucirc;</P>
<P>37. King Pasenadi of Kosala agreeing and delighted in the words of the Blessed One, got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One and went away.<BR>

<B><P>43. 1. 2.<BR>
(2) Anur&agrave;ddho &Yacute; Venerable Anur&agrave;ddha</P>
</B><P>1. At one time the Blessed One was living in the gabled hall in the Great Forest in Vesali.</P>
<P>2. At that time venerable Anur&agrave;ddha was living in a forest hut not far away from the Blessed One.</P>
<P>3. Then many wandering ascetics of other sects approached venerable Anur&agrave;ddha exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side.</P>
<P>4. Sitting on a side those wandering ascetics said to venerable Anur&agrave;ddha: &szlig;Friend, Anur&agrave;ddha, since the Thus Gone One is the foremost man, the most excellent and has attained the highest, the Thus Gone One is pointed out in these four instances `the Thus Gone One is, after death' or `the Thus Gone One is not after death' or the Thus Gone One is and is not after death' or `the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death'?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Friends, since the Thus Gone One is the foremost man, the most excellent and has attained the highest, the Thus Gone One is pointed out excluding him from these four instances `the Thus Gone One is, after death' or `the Thus Gone One is not after death' or the Thus Gone One is and is not after death' or `the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>When this was said the wandering ascetics of other sects said: &szlig;This monk is a novice who has gone forth recently or if he is an elder he is foolish and not learned.&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. The wandering ascetics of other sects depreciating venerable Anur&agrave;ddha as a novice and as foolish got up from their seats and went away.</P>
<P>6. Soon after the wandering ascetics of other sects had gone away, it occurred to venerable Anur&agrave;ddha, if the wandering ascetics had questioned me further, how answering would I reply them according to the Teaching and not blame the Blessed One falsely.</P>
<P>7. Then venerable Anur&agrave;ddha approached the Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side.</P>
<P>8. Sitting on a side venerable Anur&agrave;ddha said to the Blessed One: &szlig;Venerable sir, I was living in a forest hut not far away from the Blessed One. Then many wandering ascetics of other sects approached me exchanged friendly greetings and sat on a side and said to me: &szlig;Friend, Anur&agrave;ddha, since the Thus Gone One is the foremost man, the most excellent and has attained the highest, the Thus Gone One is pointed out in these four instances `the Thus Gone One is, after death' or `the Thus Gone One is not after death' or the Thus Gone One is and is not after death' or `the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death? Venerable sir, then I said to them,</P>
<P>Friends, since the Thus Gone One is the foremost man, the most excellent and has attained the highest, the Thus Gone One is pointed out excluding him from these four instances `the Thus Gone One is after death' or `the Thus Gone One is not after death' or the Thus Gone One is and is not after death' or `the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death' Venerable sir, when I said this the wandering ascetics of other sects said, This monk is a novice who has gone forth recently or if he is an elder he is foolish and not learned. The wandering ascetics of other sects depreciating me as a novice and as foolish got up from their seats and went away.</P>
<P>9. Soon after the wandering ascetics of other sects had gone away, it occurred to me, if the wandering ascetics had questioned me further, how answering would I reply them according to the Teaching and not blame the Blessed One falsely.&ucirc;</P>
<P>10. &szlig;Anur&agrave;ddha, is matter permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;It is impermanent venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That which is impermanent is it unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is unpleasant.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That impermanent, unpleasant, changing thing is it suitable to consider it's mine, it's me or it's my self&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is not suitable.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Anur&agrave;ddha, are feelings &#57389; re &#57389; perceptions &#57389; re &#57389; intentions &#57389; re &#57389; consciousness permanent or impermanent?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;It is impermanent venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That which is impermanent is it unpleasant or pleasant?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is unpleasant.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That impermanent, unpleasant, changing thing, is it suitable to consider it is mine, it is me or it is my self?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is not suitable.&ucirc;</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Therefore Anur&agrave;ddha, whatever matter in the past, that will be in the future or at present, seized or not, rough or fine, unexalted or not, far or near is not mine, is not me, is not my self; this should be seen with right wisdom as it really is. Whatever feelings &#57389; re &#57389; perceptions &#57389; intentions &#57389; re &#57389; consciousness in the past, that will be in the future or at present, seized or not, rough or fine, unexalted or not, far or near is not mine, is not me, is not my self; this should be seen with right wisdom as it really is.</P>
<P>12. Anur&agrave;ddha, the learned noble disciple seeing it thus, turns from matter &#57389; re &#57389; turns from feelings &#57389; re &#57389; turns from perceptions &#57389; re &#57389; turns from intentions and turns from consciousness. Turning loses interest and is released. Released he knows I am released, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, duties are done, there is nothing more I could wish.</P>
<P>13. Anur&agrave;ddha, do you reflect, the Thus Gone One is matter?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not&ucirc;.</P>
<P>&szlig;Do you reflect, the Thus Gone One is feelings?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not&ucirc;.</P>
<P>&szlig;Do you reflect, the Thus Gone One is perceptions?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Do you reflect, the Thus Gone One is intentions?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Do you reflect, the Thus Gone One is consciousness?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not&ucirc;</P>
<P>14. Anur&agrave;ddha, do you reflect the Thus Gone One in matter?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Do you reflect the Thus Gone One outside matter?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>15. Anur&agrave;ddha, do you reflect the Thus Gone One in feelings?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Do you reflect the Thus Gone One outside feelings?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>16. Anur&agrave;ddha, do you reflect the Thus Gone One in perceptions?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Do you reflect the Thus Gone One outside perceptions?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>17. Anur&agrave;ddha, do you reflect the Thus Gone One in intentions?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Do you reflect the Thus Gone One outside intentions?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>18. Anur&agrave;ddha, do you reflect the Thus Gone One in consciousness?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Do you reflect the Thus Gone One outside consciousness?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>19. &szlig;Anur&agrave;ddha, do you reflect a material, feeling, perceptive, intentional and conscious Thus Gone One?.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>20. &szlig;Anur&agrave;ddha, do you reflect an immaterial, non-feeling, non-perceptive, unintentional and non-conscious Thus Gone One?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, I do not.&ucirc;</P>
<P>21. &szlig;Anur&agrave;ddha, even here and now not gaining the Thus Gone One, in truth and reality is it suitable to explain the Thus Gone One as the foremost man, the most excellent and has attained the highest, excluding him from these four instances `the Thus Gone One is, after death' or `the Thus Gone One is not after death' or the Thus Gone One is and is not after death' or `the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death'?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;No, venerable sir, it is not suitable.&ucirc;</P>
<P>22. &szlig;Good Anur&agrave;ddha! You have understood it! Even in the past and now too I point out unpleasantness and its cessation.&ucirc;<BR>

<P>17. Sitting on a side Vacchagotta said to venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na: &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, is the world eternal?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, it is not declared by the Blessed One, `the world is eternal'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>19. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, is the world not eternal?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, it is not declared by the Blessed One, `the world is not eternal'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>20. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, is the world limited?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, it is not declared by the Blessed One, `the world is limited'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>21. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;, is the world not limited?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, it is not declared by the Blessed One, `the world is not limited'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>22. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, is the soul and body one?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, it is not declared by the Blessed One, `the soul and body are one&ucirc;</P>
<P>23. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, is the soul one and the body another?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, it is not declared by the Blessed One, `the soul is one and body another'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>24. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, the Thus Gone One is, after death?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, it is not declared by the Blessed One, `the Thus Gone One is, after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>25. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, the Thus Gone One is not after death?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, it is also not declared by the Blessed One, `the Thus Gone One is not after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>26. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, `the Thus Gone One is and is not after death'?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, it is also not declared by the Blessed One, `the Thus Gone One is and is not after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>27. &szlig;Good Mogg&agrave;llana, the Thus Gone One, is not and neither not after death?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, it is also not declared by the Blessed One, `the Thus Gone One is not and neither not, after death'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>28. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, for what reason do the wandering ascetics of other sects when questioned declare the world is eternal, the world is not eternal, the world is limited, the world is not limited, the soul and the body is one, the soul is one and the body another, the Thus Gone One is after death, the Thus Gone is not after death, the Thus Gone One is and is not after death, the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death? Good Moggall&agrave;nna, for what reason does the recluse Gotama when questioned not declare the world is eternal or the world is not eternal, the world is limited or the world is not limited, the soul and body is one or the soul is one and the body another, the Thus Gone One is after death or the Thus Gone is not after death or the Thus Gone One is and is not after death or the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death?&ucirc;</P>
<P>29. &szlig;Vaccha, the wandering ascetics of other sects reflect, matter as oneself or a material self, or in self matter or in matter self. Reflect feelings as oneself or a feeling self, or in self feelings or in feelings self. Reflect perceptions as oneself or a perceiving self, or in self perceptions or in perceptions self. Reflect intentions as oneself or an intending self, or in self intentions or in intentions self. Reflect consciousness as oneself or a conscious self, or in self consciousness or in consciousness self. Therefore when the wandering ascetics are thus questioned they reply the world is eternal, not eternal, the world is limited, not limited, the Thus Gone One is, after death, the Thus Gone One is not after death, the Thus Gone One is and is not after death, the thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death.</P>
<P>30. &szlig;Vaccha, the Thus Gone One, worthy and rightfully enlightened does not reflect, matter as oneself or a material self, or in self matter or in matter self. Does not reflect feelings as oneself or a feeling self, or in self feelings or in feelings self. Does not reflect perceptions as oneself or a perceiving self, or in self perceptions or in perceptions self. Does not reflect intentions as oneself or an intending self, or in self intentions or in intentions self. Does not reflect consciousness as oneself or a conscious self, or in self consciousness or in consciousness self. Therefore when the Thus Gone One is questioned he does not declare the world is eternal, not eternal, the world is limited, not limited, the Thus Gone One is, after death, the Thus Gone One is not after death, the Thus Gone One is and is not after death, the thus Gone One neither is, nor is not after death.&ucirc;</P>
<P>31. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, it is surprising and wonderful how the essence, the words and even the letters of the Teacher and the disciple agree and express the same idea.</P>
<P>32. &szlig;Good Moggall&agrave;na, here I approached the recluse Gotama and asked this same question and the recluse Gotama explained the meaning with these same words and phrases as good Moggall&agrave;na did. Good Moggall&agrave;na, it is wonderful and surprising how the words phrases and even the letters of the Teacher and disciple agree does not disagree anywhere.&ucirc;</P>

<P>4. &szlig;This Purana Kassapa, who has a large gathering and many followers, the teacher of the gathering, considered by many as a famous and good ford maker, when his disciples passed away, he declared their births, this one is born there and this one is born here. About his disciples the great men, who had attained excellence and the highest ideal, when they passed away too, he declared their births, this one is born there and this one is born here.</P>

<P>7. &szlig;This Sajaya Bela&ntilde;&ntilde;hiputta too, who has a large gathering and many followers, the teacher of the gathering, considered by many as a famous and good ford maker, when his disciples passed away, he declared their births, this one is born there and this one is born here.

<P>9. &szlig;This Ajitha Kesakambala too, who has a large gathering and many followers, the teacher of the gathering, considered by many as a famous and good ford maker, when his disciples passed away, he declared their births, this one is born there and this one is born here. About his disciples the great men, who had attained excellence and the highest ideal, when they passed away too, he declared their births, this one is born there and this one is born here.</P>
<P>10. &szlig;This recluse Gotama too, who has a large gathering and many followers, the teacher of the gathering, considered by many as a famous and good ford maker, when his disciples passed away, he declared their births, this one is born there and this one is born here. About his disciples the great men, who had attained excellence and the highest ideal, when they passed away he did not declare their births, this one is born there or this one is born here. Yet he declared they destroyed craving, turned from the bonds and rightfully understanding measuring made an end of unpleasantness.</P>
<P>11. &szlig;Good Gotama, doubts and logical reasoning arose in me as to how I could know and experience the Teaching of the recluse Gotama?&ucirc;</P>
<P>12. &szlig;Vaccha, it is suitable that you should doubt and reason logically. When you doubt, you reason out logically. Vaccha, with holding I point out birth, no birth without holding.</P>
<P>13. &szlig;Vaccha, just as fire burns supported by fuel, with holding there is birth, no birth without holding.&ucirc;</P>
<P>14. &szlig;Good Gotama, when fire is thrown by the wind, it goes even further, here good Gotama what could be pointed as the supportive condition?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, when fire is thrown by the wind, it goes further, there I say the wind is the supportive condition.&ucirc;</P>
<P>15. &szlig;Good Gotama, at the time this body is laid down and the being is not born in another body, what is the supportive condition that good Gotama points to?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Vaccha, at the time this body is laid down and the being is not born in another body, I say the supportive condition is craving.&ucirc;<BR>

<P>&szlig;Good Gotama, is there no soul?&ucirc;</P>
<P>Again the Blessed One became silent</P>
<P>Then the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta got up from his seat and went away.</P>
<P>4. Soon after the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta had gone away, venerable &acirc;nanda said to the Blessed One: &szlig;Venerable sir, why did the Blessed One not reply when the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta asked a question?&ucirc;</P>
<P>5. &szlig;&acirc;nanda, if I replied `there is a soul' to the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta's question `is there a soul' I would be with the recluses and Brahmins who hold the view of eternity</P>
<P>6. &acirc;nanda, if I replied `there is no soul' to the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta's question `is there no soul' I would be with the recluses and Brahmins who hold the view of annihilation.</P>
<P>7. &acirc;nanda, if I replied `there is a soul' to the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta's question `is there a soul' wouldn't it be straightforwardly supporting knowledge `all thoughts lack soul.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;That is not so, venerable sir.&ucirc;</P>
<P>8. &acirc;nanda, if I replied `there is no soul' to the wandering ascetic Vacchagotta's question `is there no soul' Vacchagotta would be more deluded, `didn't I have a soul earlier, now it isn't!&ucirc;<BR>
