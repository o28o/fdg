<P>306. Bhikkhus, to a person with wrong view his bodily, verbal and mental actions would be guided according to the standard of attainment of his view, so too his intentions, wishes, aspirations and determinations. They would be unsuitable, disagreeable, and conducive to unpleasantness. What is the reason? It is because of his wrong view. Bhikkhus, just as a nimba seed, a kosataki seed or a bitter goad seed [1] embedded in wet soil would draw the essence in the soil and water and all that essence would be bitter. In the same manner the bodily, verbal, mental actions, intentions, wishes, aspirations and determinations of a person with wrong view, would be guided according to the standard of attainment of his view and they would be unsuitable, disagreeable and conducive to unpleasantness.</P>

<P>Notes.</P>
<P>( 1) I do not specify thinking even for a short second. <I>`appamattaka&uuml;pi bhava&uuml; na va&otilde;&otilde;emi</I>' Always thoughts seek connections in the past, for the future or in the present. The bhikkhu who aims extinction should not advocte thinking, as thoughts prolong the journey in existence. </P>

<P>334. In the same way bhikkhus, a few are fed on the most excellent food and the rest feed on whatever available crumbs. </P>
<P>335. Bhikkhus, a few find access to the meanings of the Teaching and the bliss of release, others do not experience release. Therefore bhikkhus, you should train to see the meanings in the Teaching to experience the bliss of release. </P>

<P>Notes.</P>
<P><A NAME="F1"></A>[1] Mindfulness of the body `k&agrave;yagat&agrave;sati' In this sutta, mindfulness of the body is equated to deathlessness. Mindfulness of the body is nothing other than the control of the six mental faculties. The Blessed One has explained that the release with knowing `a&agrave;vimutti' is the release that one experiences when his six spheres of mental contact do not arouse feelings in any circumstance. So this is explained as deathlessness `amatapada&uuml;' or arahanship here and now. </P>
