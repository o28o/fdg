Then he hears, a certain person of warrior clan is made the head anointed warrior king. Hearing this it does not occur to him &THORN; O! when will I be the head anointed warrior king.

<P>Here, bhikkhu, the righteous universal monarch who values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching and makes arrangements to protect himself together with the populace.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhu the righteous universal monarch who values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching makes arrangements to protect all warriors, all brahmins, all the populace in the suburbs, all recluses and all animals.</P>
<P>O! bhikkhu the righteous universal monarch who values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching, makes arrangements to protect himself, all the, populace, warriors, brahmins, people in the suburbs, recluses and animals. In this manner he rolls the wheel not to be stopped by the hand of any opposing human.</P>
<P>O! Bhikkhu, in the same manner, the Thus Gone One worthy, rightfully enlightened and righteous, values righteousness and pays homage to the Teaching, making the Teaching his flag and sign, righteously protects the Teaching, arranging the protection of bodily activity thus: This kind of bodily activity should be practised and this kind of bodily activity should not be practised.</P>

<P>5. Pacetano. &THORN; King Pacetana</P>
<P>15. At one time the Blessed One was living in the deer park in Isipatana in Benares and addressed the bhikkhus. Bhikkhus, in the past, there was a king by the name Pacetana. One day he called the chariot maker and asked him: Friend, chariot maker, in another six months, there will be a battle, could you make a pair of new wheels? The chariot maker replied: Possible my'lord.</P>
<P>The chariot maker made one wheel, six days before the completion of the six months. The king addressed the chariot maker again and told him, Friend, chariot maker in another six days, there will be a battle. Are the pair of wheels made?</P>
<P>My lord, six days before the completion of the six months, I have made one wheel.</P>
<P>Friend, chariot maker, is it possible to make the other wheel in the remaining six days. Possible. Lord.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the chariot maker completed the other wheel in the remaining six days and approached king Pacet&agrave;na and said My lord, here are the new pair of wheels.</P>
<P>Friend chariot maker, what is the difference in the wheel you made, in six months short of six days and the wheel you made in six days, I see no difference in them.</P>
<P>My lord, there is a difference, now you will see the difference.</P>
<P>Then the chariot maker taking the wheel done in six days, set it rolling. It rolled on as long as the intended activity prevailed, circled and fell on the ground. Then he rolled the wheel made in six months short of six days. It rolled on as long as the intended activity prevailed, and stood as though saying the work is done.</P>
<P>My lord, of the wheel made in six days, the outer circumference, the spokes, and the nave are crooked, faulty and with blemishes. It rolled on as long as the intended activity prevailed, then circled and fell on the ground. My lord, of the wheel made in six months short of six days, the outer circumference, the spokes, and the nave are not crooked, not faulty and without blemishes. It rolled on as long as the intended activity prevailed and then stood upright as though to say the work is done. .</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, did it occur to you, that the chariot maker was someone else. Bhikkhus, it should be known that I was that chariot maker at that time. Then I was clever in the crookedness, faults and blemishes of wood. Now I'm worthy, rightfully enlightened and clever in bodily crookednesses, faults and blemishes. I am clever in verbal crookednesses, faults and blemishes and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, whoever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni, who has not dispelled bodily, verbal and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes in this dispensation, will have a fall like the wheel done in six days. Bhikkhus, whoever bhikkhu or bhikkhuni, who has dispelled bodily, verbal and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes, will stand firm in this dispensation like the wheel done in six months less by six days.</P>
<P>Therefore, bhikkhus, your training should be, we will dispel bodily, verbal and mental crookednesses, faults and blemishes.</P>
<P>6. Apa&otilde;&otilde;akasutta&uuml; &THORN; A sure method.</P>
<P>16. Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endowed with three things follows the sure method from the beginning with aroused effort, for the destruction of desires. What three? Here the bhikkhu is controlled in his mental faculties, knows the right amount to partake and is wakeful.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how is the bhikkhu controlled in his mental faculties? Here the bhikkhu seeing a form does not take the sign or the details&ograve;o someone abiding with the mental faculty of the eye uncontrolled may arise thoughts of greed and displeasure, so he controls the mental faculty of the eye. Hearing a sound, ... re ... Smelling a scent, ... re ... Tasting food, ... re ... Sensing a touch ... re ... Cognising an idea does not take the sign or the details. To someone abiding with the mental faculty of the mind uncontrolled may arise thoughts of greed and displeasure, so he controls the mental faculty of the mind. Thus the bhikkhu is controlled in his mental faculties.</P>
<P>How does the bhikkhu know the right amount to partake? Here the bhikkhu wisely considering partakes food, not for, fun, intoxication or to look beautiful. He partakes food thinking I partake this, for maintaining the body without attachment to tastes, as a help to lead the holy life Partaking this food I get rid of earlier feelings, do not arouse new feelings. It should be faultless, and for a pleasant abiding. In this manner the bhikkhu knows the right amount to partake. .</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how is the bhikkhu wakeful? Here the bhikkhu cleans the mind of obstructing things during the day time, seated some where. During the first watch of the night too he cleans the mind of obstructing things. In the middle watch of the night he lies down turning to his right side, taking the posture in which the lion sleeps. Putting one foot over the other he becomes aware of the perception of waking. Getting up in the last watch of the night he cleans the mind of obstructing things. Thus the bhikkhu becomes wakeful. Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endowed with these three things from the beginning with aroused effort, follows the sure method for the destruction of desires.</P>
<P>7. Attaby&agrave;b&agrave;dhsutta. &THORN; Causing trouble to oneself</P>
<P>17. Bhikkhus, three things are troublesome to oneself, troublesome to others, and bring trouble on both parties. What three?</P>

<P>18. Bhikkhus, if ascetics of another faith ask you: Friends, do you lead the holy life in the dispensation of the recluse Gotama, to be born in heaven? Wouldn't you be worried, wouldn't you loathe it? Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, wouldn't you be worried and wouldn't you loathe that heavenly, life span, beauty, pleasantness, fame and authority. Isn't it better that you be worried and loathe bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct and mental misconduct.</P>

We too should give him presents from time to time. Thus the shopkeeper becomes resourceful. Bhikkhus, endowed with these three things the shopkeeper very soon comes to abundance and great wealth.</P>

Here the bhikkhu from time to time approaches the learned bhikkhus, the bearers of the Teaching and the Discipline, those who know the headings and asks them: Venerable sirs, what is the meaning of this? Those venerable ones explain to him and disclose the hidden meanings. Thus he dispels his various doubts in the Teaching. Thus the bhikkhu becomes resourceful.
