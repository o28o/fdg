</B><P>1. Pubbesambodhasutta&uuml; &Yacute; Before enlightenment</P>
<P>104. Bhikkhus, when I was not yet enlightened, it occured to me: In this world what is the satisfaction, what is the danger and what is the escape? Then I occured to me: The arising of pleasure and pleasantness in the world on account of something, is the satisfaction in this world. That there is impermanence, unpleasantness and change in the world, that is the danger. The driving out, interest and greed in the world, the dispelling of interest and greed is the escape from the world. Bhikkhus, until I knew as it really is, the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape, I did not announce to the world together with its gods, Maras, Brahmas, the community of recluses and brahmins, my rightful enlightenment. Knowledge arose to me about my vision. The release of my mind is unshakeable. This is my last birth, there will be no more rebirths.</P>
<P>2. Pa&ntilde;hamass&agrave;dasutta&uuml; &Yacute; The first on satisfaction</P>
<P>105. Bhikkhus, I went in search of satisfaction in the world, whatever satisfaction there is in the world, I experienced it and thoroughly saw it with wisdom Bhikkhus, I went in search of the danger in the world, whatever danger there is in the world, I found out and thoroughly saw it with wisdom. Bhikkhus, I went in search of the escape in the world, whatever escape there is in the world, I found it out and thoroughly saw it with wisdom.</P>

<P>3. Dutiyass&agrave;dasutta&uuml; &Yacute; The second on satisfaction</P>
<P>106. Bhikkhus, if there was no satisfaction in the world, sentient beings would not be attached to this world. Since there is a satisfaction, sentient beings are attached to this world Bhikkhus, if there was no danger in the world, sentient beings would not turn away from this world. Since there is a danger, sentient beings turn away from this world Bhikkhus, if there was no escape from the world, sentient beings would not escape from this world. Since there is an escape, sentient beings escape from this world.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, until the sentient being knows as it really is, the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape, he would not free himself, unfetter and release himself without restrictions from this world together with gods and men, Maras, Brahmas and the community of recluses and brahmins Bhikkhus, when the sentient being knows as it really is, the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape, he frees himself, unfetters and releases himself and abides without restrictions from this world together with gods and men, Maras, Brahmas and the community of recluses and brahmins.</P>
<P>4. Samanabrahmanasutta&uuml; &Yacute; Recluses and brahmins</P>
<P>107. Bhikkhus, those recluses and brahmins who do not know as it really is, the satisfaction as the satisfaction, the danger as the danger and the escape as the escape, are not my recluses, or brahmins, or those doing the recluseship, or those that can be called recluses or brahmins or those that can be called brahmins. These venerable ones will not come to recluseship or brahminship in this very life by themselves realizing and abide.</P>

<P>5. Ru&otilde;&otilde;asutta&uuml; &Yacute; Crying</P>
<P>108. Bhikkhus, singing is crying in this discipline of the noble ones and dancing is insanity. Bhikkhus, it is childish to laugh too long showing your teeth. Therefore give up singing, dancing and it is suitable that you, delighting in the Teaching should laugh to a certain extent only.</P>
