<P>114. Bhikkhus, without dispelling these three, it is loss, it is hell. What three?</P>
<P>With a promise to lead the holy life, breaking it, falsely degrading one who lives the pure holy life, and he that falls for it, upholding the view that there is nothing wrong in sensual desires. Bhikkhus, without dispelling these three, it is loss, it is hell.</P>
<P>2. Dullabhasutta&uuml; &Yacute; Rare arisings</P>
<P>115. Bhikkhus, the arising of three things are rare in the world. What three? The arising of the Thus Gone One, worthy and rightfully enlightened is rare the world.

Bhikkhus, the arising of these three things are rare in the world.</P>
<P>3. Appameyyasutta&uuml; &Yacute; Immeasurable</P>
<P>116. Bhikkhus, these three kinds of persons are in the world What three? The one easily measured, the one measured with difficulty, and the immeasurable one.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, who is the easily measured one?</P>
<P>Here bhikkhus, a certain person is excited, muddled in mind, puffed up and vain, is forgetful with loose talk is confused not aware with uncontrolled mentl faculties. Bhikkhus, such a person is easily measured.</P>

<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person overcoming all perceptions of matter and going beyond perceptions of anger, not attending to various perceptions, [1] With boundless space attains to the sphere of space. He becomes fully satisfied in it, strives after it and prospers in it. Becoming intent on it and making much of it, without falling away from it, he dies and is born with the gods of the sphere of space. The gods of the sphere of space have a life span of twenty thousand forward world cycles. An ordinary person having completed that life span would go even to hell, the animal world or be born with the ghosts. As for the disciples of the Blessed One, completing that life span would extinguish in that same birth. Bhikkhus, this is the difference and the peculiarity in the course of action, birth and conscience of the noble disciple and the ordinary person.</P>
