AT URUVELA</P>
</B><P>(1) Need of a Teacher</P>
<P>0nce the Exalted One dwelt in the Park of An&agrave;thapindika at Jetavana in (the city of) S&agrave;vaithi. Then He addressed the brethren, "0 brethren." They replied, " Yea, Lord." The Exalted One spake thus;</P>
<P>Once, brethren, soon after attaining Enlightenment, I dwelt near the Goat-herd's Banyan-tree on the banks of the river Neranjar&agrave; in (the village of) Uruvels. When so alone with thoughts collected, this train of thought arose in my mind "It is indeed sorrowful to dwell without one to respect or be obedient unto (as teacher). What if I dwell serving, esteeming and depending upon some recluse or brahmin (as teacher)?</P>
<P>In my mind brethren, this train of thought also occurred: For the purpose of fulfilling any virtues, selfconcentration, insight or emancipation still unperfected, in the wo;rld of gods, M&agrave;ras, Brahm&agrave;s and among all devas and men, I see not another recluse or br&agrave;hmin, who is superior in virtuous conduct, self-eoncentration, insight or emaneipation, whom I may live serving, esteeming and depending upon (as teacher).'</P>
<EM><P>11.§ 21] At Uruvel&agrave; 27</P>
</EM><P>Then, brethren, this other train of thought occurred to my mind: ' This Norm was realised by myself and is it* meet that I should dwell serving, esteeming and depending upon the Norm (as teacher).' Thereafter, brethren, Brahm&agrave; Sahampati, knowing, by his mind what was in my mind, even as a powerful man extends his bended arm or bends his extended arm, vanished from the Brahma realm and appeared before me. Then, brethren, Btrahm&agrave; Sahampati uncovering his robe from one shoulder, placing his right knee on the ground. and bending his joined hands towards me in adoration said thus 'It is even so, Exalted One, it is even so, Auspicious One ! Indeed for a long time in the past the Enlightened Arahant Buddhas Supreme dwelt serving, esteeming and depending upon the Norm (as teacher). , For a long time in the future the Enlightened Arahant Buddhas Supreme will dwell serving, esteeming and depending upon the Norm (as teacher). Lord, may the 'Enlightened Arahant, Buddha Supreme also at the present time dwell serving, esteeming and depending upon the Norm (as teacher).' So said . Brahm&agrave; Sahampati, and having said so, uttered this further:</P>
<P>The Perfect Buddhas that are past,</P>
<P>The Perfect Buddhas yet to come,</P>
<P>The Perfect Buddha that is now,</P>
<P>Who hath for many banished woe-</P>
<P>All these did dwell, do dwell and still</P>
<P>Shall dwell in reverence for the Norm,</P>
<P>Wherefore let him who wisheth much</P>
<P>Prosperity unto himself</P>
<P>Do reverence to the Perfect Norm,</P>
<P>Remembering the Buddha's word.'</P>
<P>28 <EM>The Numerical </EM>Sayings [TBXT ii, 22</P>
<P>So said Brahm&agrave; Sahampati. Having said so, he did obeisance to me, walked around me by the right and vanished there and then. Thus indeed, brethren, I yielded to Brahm&agrave;'s entreaty. This Norm indeed, which is like unto me, was realised by myself. I shall</P>
<P>therefore dwell serving, esteeming and depending upon this Norm. Whenever, brethren, the Order becomes endowed with eminence, then shall I have deep regard for the Order also."</P>
<P>(2) Who is an Elder?</P>
<P>Brethren, just after Enlightenment, once I dwelt here, near the Goat-herd's Banyan-tree on the banks of the river Neranjar&agrave; in (the village of) Uruvels. Then indeed, brethren, many decayed, old, frail, decrepit and aged brghmins came to where I was. Having come they greeted me, held pleasant and reminiscent talk with me and sat down at one side. Brethren, those br&agrave;hmins so seated said to me:' Thus have we ' heard, Master Gotama, that Gotama the recluse neither greets, gets up from his seat for, nor offers seats to decayed, old, frail, decrepit and aged br&agrave;hmins. Master Gotama, it is even so. The worthy Gotama neither greets nor gets up from his seat for, nor offers seats to decayed, old, frail, decrepit and aged br&agrave;hmins. It is even so Master Gotama, but it is not proper so to do.'</P>
<P>Then, brethren, this thought came to my mind: ' Of a truth, these venerable ones know not who an elder * is,</P>

<P>2 <EM>Thera</EM>- <EM>karana-dhamm&agrave;</EM>, literally thera-making things, the qualifications of an elder.</P>
<EM><P>111 § 22] At Uruvel&agrave; 29</P>
</EM><P>nor the qualifications of an elder. Indeed, brethren, one may be eighty, ninety or a hundred years old from his birth: yet if he speaks at an improper time, tells lies, utters useless words and says what is not the Norm and the Discipline, also if he speaks what deserves not to be remembered, and at inopportune times endlessly talks empty words which tend not to benefit, then such a person is reckoned as a foolish elder.</P>
<P>Brethren, even though a child or a youth has dark hair, in his happy youth and the first stage of life, yet if he speaks at the proper time and then only what is true, utters words useful and in keeping with the Norm and the Discipline and what is deserving of being remembered, and also at opportune times gives sound and beneficial advice, even such an one is indeed reckoned among the wise elders.</P>
<P>Brethren, there are these four qualifications of an elder. What are the four? Here (in the world), brethren, a brother is virtuous, dwells in the observance of P&agrave;timokkha rules, is endowed with good manners and behaviour, fears even venial sins and taking the precepts practises them.</P>
<P>Then a brother is well-versed, with good memory well-stored, in that Norm which is beautiful in the beginning, in the middle and in the end, both in its spirit and in the letter, fulfilled in its entirety, and which declares the perfect life of purity. 1 say he is well-versed in such Norm, has memorised and learnt it by rote, pondered over and seen it with the clear eye of insight. Then, again (a brother) without effort, but easily and comfortably takes pleasure in (the Four) Ecstasies (Jh&agrave;nas), which are dependent upon clear consciousness and which result in happiness in this world.</P>
<P>30 <EM>Tlw Numerical SaYings </EM>[TEXT ii, 23</P>
<P>And lastly, by eliminating the Intoxicants a brother dwells here in this life having attained that emancipation of heart, which is free from the Intoxicants (&acirc;savas), and the fruition of insight, having fully realised (the same),with clear vision. These indeed, brethren, are the qualifications of an elder."</P>
<P>He who with muddled head pours forth</P>
<P>Much idle talk, with thoughts devoid</P>
<P>Of all restraint-he is a fool</P>
<P>Who takes no pleasure in the Norm.</P>
<P>Far from the rank of ' elder ' he.'</P>
<P>His view is wrong: he pays no heed.</P>
<P>But whoso leads an upright life In all its fulness, he--a sage,</P>
<P>A learned man, of ready wit,</P>
<P>Of mind controlled-with wisdom's eye</P>
<P>He sees things as they really are.</P>
<P>Transcending all conditions he,-</P>
<P>Of open mind, of ready wit,</P>
<P>He hath rejected birth and death- He's perfect in the holy life.</P>
<P>That is the man I` elder' call</P>

<P>For by destruction of the taints</P>

She had attained to the state of Sot&agrave;patti, but K&agrave;laka and his people were followers of the Acelakas (naked ascetics). One day K&agrave;alaka treated his Arahants (i.e., the Acelakas) with a meal at his house. The meal over, he invited his daughter in-law to enter and do obeisance to his Arahants. As soon as C&aring;lasubhadda, saw the ascetic wretches, she spat, and saying ' chih, chih,' turned back and speedily re-entered her chamber. Shortly thereafter, K&agrave;laka asked her to invite her own Arahants for a meal and fixed the very next day, intending thus to discomfit her. C&aring;lasubhadda accordingly rose to the occasion, went up to her room on the upper floor of the house, opened out the window, threw to the sky eight handfuls of sweet flowers and wished that the Exalted One, with five hundred apostles, might accept her invitation</P>

He is neither disappointed with not getting robes, nor does he covet robes that he receives. He is not elated thereby, nor overcome by greed.

<P>I shall point out a recluse or a br&agrave;hmin, who though he has repudiated the portion of the Norm relating to absence of covetousness, is still addicted to covetousness and cleaves</P>
<P>to worldly possessions,' ' to him then I say thus;' Pray come, speak, expound! I shall see his power." Of a truth, Wanderers, that he should so point out a recluse or a br&agrave;hmin, who though he has repudiated that portion of the Norm relating to absence of covetousness is still covetous and cleaves to worldly possessions-such a thing is not possible.</P>
<P>If indeed, 0 Wanderers, any one says thus: ' I shall point out a recluse or a br&agrave;hmin, who though he has repudiated that portion of the Norm relating to absence of hatred, is evil-minded and ill-disposed, to him then I say thus: ' Pray come, speak, expound ! 1 shall see his power.' Of a truth, 0 Wanderers, that he should so point out a recluse or a br&agrave;hmin, who though he has repudiated that portion of the Norm relating to absence of hatred is still evil-minded and ill-disposed-such a thing is not possible.</P>

<P>1 The implication here is that he is not a true recluse or a brahmin who is covetous, etc.</P>

<P>iii. § 30] At Uruvel&agrave; 43</P>
<P>that portion of the Norm relating to right mindfulness is confused in mind and ignorant, to him then I say thus: ' Pray come, speak,'expound ! I shall see his power.' Of a truth, 0 Wanderers, that,he should so point out a recluse or a br&agrave;hmin, who, though he has repudiated that portion of the Norm relating to right mindfulness, is still confused in mind and ignorant-such a thing is not possible.</P>
<P>If indeed, 0 Wanderers, any one says thus I shall point out a recluse or a br&agrave;hmin who, though he has repudiated that portion of the Norm relating to right concentration, is discomposed and unstable in mind, to him then I say thus 'Pray come, speak, expound ! I shall see his power.' Of a truth, 0 Wanderers, that he should so point out a recluse or a br&agrave;hmin, who though he has repudiated that portion of the Norm relating to right concentration is discomposed and unstable in mind-such a thing is not possible.</P>
<P>If indeed, 0 Wanderers, any one think that these four portions of the Norm are blameworthy and reproachable, he will in this life-time meet with four just causes for censure and condemnation. What are the four? This honourable one finds fault with the portion of the Norm relating to absence of covetousness. Whosoever, whether recluse or br&agrave;hmin, is addicted to covetousness or cleaves to worldly possessions, he is venerated by this honourable one, he is praised by this honourable one.</P>
<P>[Similarly <EM>with regard to </EM>absence of hatred, right mindfulness and right concentration.]</P>
<P>Whosoever,' 0 Wanderers, should deem these four portions of the Norm fit for blame and fit for reproach,</P>

<P>upon him even in this life come four lawful grounds for reproach and blame. Even ' those folk of Ukkali, namely Vassa' and Bha&otilde;&otilde;&agrave;, deniers of cause, deniers of deed, deniers of any reality-even they used to hold these four portions of the Norm to be without reproach and undeserving of censure. Because of what? Because they feared censure, attack, reproach.</P>
<P>Whose bath no malevolence,</P>
<P>Ever of concentrated mind-</P>
<P>Who inwardly is well-composed,</P>
<P>Holding himself from coveting-</P>
<P>An earnest learner is he called.</P>
