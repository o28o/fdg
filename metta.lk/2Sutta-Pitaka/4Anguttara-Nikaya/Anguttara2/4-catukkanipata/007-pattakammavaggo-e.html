<P>Householder, these four rare things in the world, pleasing and agreeable for worldly pleasure and charm, conduce to the gain of four things. What four?</P>
<P>The attainment of faith, virtues, generosity and wisdom.</P>
<P>Householder, what is the attainment of faith?</P>
<P>Here, householder, the noble disciple establishes faith in the enlightenment of the Thus Gone One: The Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, is endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and Blessed. Householder, to this is called the attainment of faith.</P>
