<P>Herein, brethren, a certain one is born into a low caste, either as a ca&otilde;&oacute;&agrave;1a, a hunter, a basket-weaver, a wheelwright,* a scavenger or as a beggar, destitute of food and drink, finding it hard to get a livelihood, born where food and clothing are hardly won. He is then of dark complexion, ugly to look upon, dwarfed, full of sickness, and either blind of one eye, deformed, and lame or paralysed. Not getting food, drink, clothes, carriage, bed, dwelling or light,</P>
<P>or perfumes and garlands of flowers, he commits evil deeds with the body, evil deeds with the lips, and evil deeds with the mind. Thus having done evil acts with the body, with the lips and with the mind, upon the dissolution of the body, he is after death reborn into a state of woe and suffering, or into purgatory. Indeed, brethren, this is the one that is in darkness and goes on into darkness.</P>

<P>3 Pundarika is the lotus flower consisting of less than one hundred petals and here:applies to <EM>sukkha- vipassaka</EM>-Arahant. He is called samana-pundarika as he lacks <EM>jh&agrave;na </EM>and <EM>abhi&iuml;&iuml;a</EM> and is imperfect in virtues. <EM>Pundarika</EM> = white lotus.</P>

</EM><P>Brethren, who is the person called the steadfast recluse ? Brethren, a brother is under training and discipline and dwells aspiring to attain the supreme emancipation from the, bonds. Just as, brethren, the eldest son of a royal anointed king, though not yet himself anointed, is quite certain of the crown. Likewise, brethren, is a brother who is under training and discipline aspiring to attain the supreme emancipation from the bonds . he indeed, brethren, is the steadfast recluse.</P>
<P>Brethren, who is the person called the white lotus-like recluse ?</P>
<P>Brethren, herein a brother, having destroyed the intoxicants, is without the intoxicants, is emancipated in mind and emancipated through insight, and in this life, having achieved supernormal knowledge, he himself dwells in the attainment thereof, but without applying his mind to the acquisition of the eight ecstatic conditions. Indeed, brethren, this is the person called the white lotus-like recluse.</P>

<P>Brethren, who is the person called the exquisite among all reclucs ?</P>
<P>Brethren, herein a brother being oft invited (to almsgiving) enjoys many robes, and few if uninvited. Being oft invited he enjoys much alms-food and but little if uninvited. Being Oft invited he enjoys bed and lodging, and few if uninvited. Being oft invited he enjoys a good store of</P>

<P>medical requisites and supports for the sick and the feeble, and but little if uninvited. If he dwell in the company of some holy ones, many of their deeds of body please him, but only a few do not please. They do many actions by word and thought that please him, but only a few that do not please. They make many presents of offerings which are pleasing and only a few that are not pleasing.</P>
<P>Whatsoever feelings there be, whether arising from bile, phlegm, wind or a combination of these, or due to change of season, being attacked by adversities, due to another's agency, or as a result of Kamma, these do not arise unto him in plenty, and he is free from illness.</P>
<P>He has gained the four pleasure-giving ecstasies easily and without difficulty, and having destroyed the intoxicants is without the intoxicants, emancipated in heart and emancipated in intellect, and himself in this very life, having realised the supreme faculties, dwells in the attainment thereof. Of a truth, brethren, this one among (all) recluses is the absolutely happy recluse.</P>
<P>Verily, brethren, if one should rightly describe it, among recluses it is Myself whom he would call the absolutely happy recluse. Brethren, if one should rightly describe it, among recluses he would call Myself the exquisite recluse, inasmuch as I use many robes being oft invited . . . <EM>[repeat the same as above set forth].</P>
