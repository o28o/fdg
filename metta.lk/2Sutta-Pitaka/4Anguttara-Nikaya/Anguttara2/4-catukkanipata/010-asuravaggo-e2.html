<P>Brethren, there are to be found existing in the world these four persons. What four?</P>
<P>Brethern, herein a certain person has attained to inwad peace of mind, but has not won realisation through insight into all conditions.</P>

<P> [Repeat as in previous discourse and continue thus:]</P>
<P>Among them, brethren, whatsoever person has attained to inward peace of mind, but has not won complete realisation through insight into all conditions, such a person, brethren, being established in inward peace of mind, but who has not won complete realisation through insight into all conditions-such a person, brethren, being established in inward peace of mind should apply himself towards acquiring complete realisation through insight into all conditions. Thus he afterwards becomes the possessor of inward peace of mind as well as complete realisation through insight into all conditions.</P>
<P>Among them, brethren, whatsoever person has won complete realisation through insight into all conditions, but has not attained to inward peace of mind, such a person, brethren, being established in the complete realisation through insight into all conditions, should apply himself towards acquiring inward peace of mind. Thus he afterwards becomes possessor both of complete realisation through insight into all conditions and of inward peaceof mind.</P>
<P>Among them, brethren, whatsoever person has not attained to inward peace of mind, nor won complete realisation through insight into all conditions-such aperson, brethren, should set going an intense resolution, aim, endeavour, exertion, effort, mindfulness and intelligence, for the purpose of performing these meritorious deeds.</P>
<P>Just as, brethren, a person whose turban* or hair is on fire sets going intense resolution, aim, endeavour, exertion, effort, mindfulness and intelligence, for putting out the</P>

<P>x. [94] On Titans 125</P>
<P>burning turban or the hair; even so, brethren, such a person should set going an intense resolution, aim, endeavour, exertion, effort, mindfulness and intelligence, for the purpose of performing these meritorious deeds.</P>
<P>He thus afterwards becomes possessor of both inward peace of mind and complete realisation through insight of all conditions. Among these, brethren, whatsoever person has both attained to inward peace of mind and also won complete realisation through insight into all conditions such person, brethren, should, after acquiring these meritorious conditions, apply himself towards destroying the intoxicants.</P>

<P>Brethren, there are to be found existin in the world these four persons. What four?</P>
<P> [Repeat as to the four as in the previous discourse, and continue thus]</P>
<P>Among them, brethren, if a person has attained to inward peace of mind, but has not won complete realisation through insight into all conditions, then, brethren, the person who. has won complete realisation of all conditions might be approached and asked by such a person thus:</P>
<P>How, friend, must component things* be viewed, and how must CO mponent things be realised, and seen with insight?"</P>

<P>To him the latter then explains it even as he has beheld and known: Friend thus and thus should component thing be viewed. Thus and thus should component things be be grasped, and thus and thus should component things be seen with insight."</P>
<P>He then afterwards becomes possessed both of inward peace of mind as well as of complte realisation through insight into all conditions.</P>
<P>Among them, brethren if a person has won complete realisation througli insight into all conditions, but has not attained to inward peace of mind -then, brethren. the person who has attained to inward peace of mind might be approched and asked by such a person thus:</P>
<P>"How, friend, should the mind be pacified, quieted, concentrated and tranquillised?"</P>
<P>To him the latter then explains it, even as he, has seen and known, thus: "Friend thus indeed should themind be pacified, concentrated, and tranquillised."</P>
<P>He thus afterwards becomes possessed both of complete realisation of the nature of things and of the inward peace of mind.</P>
<P>Among theni, brethren, if a person has neither attained to inward peace of mind, nor won complete realisation of the nature of things, then, brethren, the person who has attained to inward peace of mind and also won complete realisation of the nature of things might be approached and asked by such a person thus:</P>
<P>How friend, should the mind be appeased, quickened, concentrated and tranquillised?</P>
<P>To him the latter then explains, even as he has known, thus:" Thus should the mind be appeased, quickened,</P>

<P>He then afterwards becomes possessed both of inward peace of mind and of complete realisation through insight into the nature of things.</P>
<P>Among them, brethren, if a person has both attained to complete realisation by insight into the nature of things and has won inward peace of mind,-then such a person being thus well established in such meritorious conditions should thereafter apply himself towards the destruction of the intoxicants.

<P>There are these four persons, brethren, to be found existing in the world. What four?</P>
<P>He who has not striven for his own welfare nor that of others: he who has striven for others' welfare, but not his own: he who has striven for his own: welfare but not others': he who has striven for both his own welfare and that of others.</P>
<P>Just as, brethren, a torch from a funeral pyre, lit at both ends, and in the middle smeared with dung, kindles no fuel either in village or in forest,-using such a figure of speech do I describe unto you this person-one who has striven neither for his own welfare nor for that of others.'</P>

<P>Then again, brethren, in the case of the person who has striven for the welfare of others but not his own-of the two he is the more excellent and eminent.</P>
<P>Then again, brethren, in the case of the person who has striven for his own welfare,and for that of others-of these four persons this latter is best and chief, topmost and highest and supreme.</P>
<P>`Just as brethren, from the cow comes milk. from milk cream, from cream butter, from butter ghee, from ghee come the skimmings of ghee,and that is reckoned best of all-even so, brethern that person who has striven both for his own welfare and for that of others is, topmost *and highest and supreme.</P>

<P>Indeed brethren, this is the person who pursues his own welfare, but not the welfare of others.</P>
<P>Brethren, who is the person that has striven for others' welfare but not his own?</P>

<P>Brethren, there are these four persons to be found existing in the world. What four?</P>
<P> [The same four persons as in the previous Discourse]</P>
<P>Brethren, who is the person that has striven for his own welfare but not that of others? Herein, brethren, a certain person is quick to observe merit rious conditions, is good at</P>
<P>remembering* the Norm which he has heard, reflects upon the meaning of the Norm so known, and learning the letter and the,meaning becomes one who has reached complete proficiency in the major and minor points of the Norm. Yet is he not pleasant of voice nor recites clearly, is not endowed with urbane speech, distinctly and clearly enunciated,* and explaining the, meaning ; he does not become one who teaches, urges, incites and gladdens* his eo-mates in the godly life. Indeed, brethren, this is the person who has striven for his own welfare but not that of others.</P>
<P>Brethren, who is the person that has striven for the welfare of others but not his own?

<P>speech, distinctly and clearly enunciated, and explaining the meaning ; so he has become one who teaches, urges, incites and gladdens his co-mates in the godly life. This indeed, brethren, is the person -who has striven for the welfare of others but not his own.</P>

<P>(9) Welfare (e) </P>
<P> [The same four personq but with the following variation:] Brethren, who is the person that has striven for his own welfare but not that of others? Herein, brethren, a certain person abstains from killing and so forth, but urges not others to abstain from killing and so forth.</P>
<P>Brethren, who is the person that has striven for the welfare of others but not his own? [This is the opposite of the former.]</P>

<P>(10) Praise and Blame</P>
<P>Now the wandering ascetic Potaliya came to where the Exalted One was. Having come he exchanged with Him</P>
<P>132 The Numerical Sayings [TEXT ii, 100</P>
<P>the greetings and compliments of civility and courtesy and took a seat at one side. To the wandering ascetic Potaliya so eated the Exalted One spoke thus:</P>
<P>"Potaliya, there are these four persons * to be found existing in the world. What four?</P>
<P>Herein, Potaliya, a certain person at the proper time in accordance with truth and fact speaks in dispraise of what is blameworthy, but does not in like manner speak well of what deserves praise.</P>
<P>Herein, Potaliya, a certain person at the proper time in accordance with truth and fact speaks well of what deserves praise but does not speak ill of what is blameworthy (in a man) .</P>
<P>Herein, Potaliya, a certain person at the proper time in accordance with truth and fact neither speaks ill of what deserves praise nor praises what is praiseworthy.</P>
<P>Herein also, Potaliya, a certain person at the proper time in accordance with truth and fact speaks ill of what deserves blame and speaks well of what is praiseworthy.</P>
<P>Potaliya, there are to be found existing in the world these four persons. Potaliya, among these four persons, whom do you commend as best and most excellent?</P>
<P>"Master Gotama, there are these four persons to be found existing in the world-as you say- [Repeat the same four persons]. Master Gotama, among these four persons the person who at the proper time in accordance with truth and fact neither speaks in dispraise of what is blameworthy, nor praises what is praiseworthy,-him do 1 commend as best and most excellent among these four</P>

<P>persons. What is the reason therefor? Master Gotama, such a person's indifference * is indeed most commendable."</P>
<P>"No indeed, Potaliya, among these four persons that person who at the proper time in accordance with truth and fact speaks in dispraise of what is blameworthy and praises what is praiseworthy,-he is best and most excellent of them all. What is the reason therefor? Potaliya, discrimination * in choosing the proper time in such things is most commendable.'</P>
<P>"0 most excellent, Master Gotama! 0 most marvellous, Master Gotama! Just as if a man were to set up that which has been overthrown, or were to reveal that which is hidden, or were to point out the way to him who has gone astray, or to bring a light so that those in darkness could see external forms -just so has the truth been expounded in many a figure by Master Gotama. So do I betake myself to Lord Gotama as my guide, to His Norm and to His Order. May Lord Gotama accept me as an adherent, as one who from this day forth, as long as life endures, has taken Him as his Guide "</P>
