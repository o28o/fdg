ON CLOUDS</P>
<P>Different Kinds of Clouds* (a)</P>
<P>Thus have 1 heard. At one time the Exalted One stayed in An&agrave;thapinika's pleasure-grove in the Jeta Wood near S&agrave;vatthi. Then the Exalted One addressed the brethren thus: "0 brethren!" They responded, "Yea, Lord!" and the Exalted One spake thus:</P>
<P>"Brethren, there are these four (kinds of) clouds. What four? That which produces thunder but not rain. That which produces rain but not thunder. That which produces neither thunder nor rain. And that which produces both thunder and rain. These, brethren, are the four clouds.</P>
<P>Likewise, brethren, there are to be found existing in the world these four persons who can be compared to these clouds. What four? He who produces thunder but not rain. He who produces rain but not thunder. He who produces neither thunder nor rain. And he who produces both thunder and rain.</P>
<P>Brethren, who is the person that produces thunder but not rain?' Herein, brethren, a certain person is a talker</P>
<P>------------</P>
<P>Cf. Pugg., Pa¤¤. IV, 8 (where Comy. says this section is spoken by a d&agrave;yaka.')</P>
<P>xi. [108] On Clouds 135</P>
<P>but not a doer.*Indeed, brethren, this is the person who produces thunder but not rain. Just as, brethren, the cloud produces thunderbut not rain, so do I speak of this person in this simile of the cloud." [The rest of this discourse may be understood mutatis mutandis.]</P>
<P>(2) Clouds (b)</P>
<P>[Repeat the same as in the previous discourse and add:] Who is the person, brethren, that produces thunder but not rain? Herein, brethren, a certain person masters the Norm comprising suta&uuml;, Geyyam. and so forth.* But he does not know, as they really are, Ill, the origin of Ill, the ceasing of Ill and the Path leading to the cessation of Ill. Indeed, brethren, this person produces thunder but not rain. Just as, brethren, the cloud produces thunder but not rain, I speak, brethren, of this person in this simile of the cloud.</P>
<P>[The rest of this discourse may be understood mutatis mutandis.]</P>
<P>(3) The Jars</P>
<P>Brethren, there are four (kinds of) jars. What four? The empty and closed, the full and open' the empty and open, and the full and closed. These., brethren, are the four.</P>

<P>Brethren, who is the person that is empty and closed?Herein, brethren, a certain person in going forward, coming backward, looking backward, drawing in and stretching out (his limbs), and in bearing alms-bowl and robes is (all) pleasant (to the sight) . But he does not know as they really are: This is Ill, this is the Origin of Ill, this is the ceasing of Ill, and this is the Path leading to the cessation of Ill." This indeed, brethren, is the person who is empty and closed. Just as, brethren, the jar is empty and closed, likewise, brethren, I speak of such a person in this simile.</P>
