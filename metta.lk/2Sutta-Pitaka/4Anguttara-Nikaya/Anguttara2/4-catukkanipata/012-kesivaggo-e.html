</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>012.01. &ograve;hen Kesi the trainer of horses, to be trained approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. The Blessed One said thus to him:</P>
<P>Kesi, you are skilled in training horses, how do you train horses?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, I train horses kindly, roughly, and I train horses kindly and roughly.</P>
<P>Kesi, when the horse to be tamed is not tamed when trained kindly, roughly and also kindly and roughly, what do you do to it?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, when the horse to be tamed is not tamed when trained kindly, roughly and also kindly and roughly, I kill it. What is the reason? May there be no blame for the clan of the master. Venerable sir, The Blessed One is the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed. How does The Blessed One tame those to be tamed?</P>
<P>Kesi, I train those to be tamed kindly, roughly and train them kindly and roughly.</P>
<P>Kesi, I train them kindly thus. This is bodily good conduct, these are the results for bodily good conduct. This is verbal good conduct, these the results for verbal good conduct. This is mental good conduct, these the results for mental good conduct, thus its heavenly and thus its human. Kesi, I train them roughly thus. This is bodily evil conduct, these are the results for bodily evil conduct. This is verbal evil conduct, these are the results for verbal evil conduct. This is mental evil conduct, these are the results for mental evil conduct, thus its hellish and thus its the sphere of beasts and ghosts.</P>
<P>Kesi, I train them kindly and harshly thus. This is bodily good conduct, these the results for bodily good conduct. This is bodily evil conduct and these the results for bodily evil conduct This is verbal good conduct, these the results for verbal good conduct. This is verbal evil conduct, these the results for evil verbal conduct. This is mental good conduct, these the results for mental good conduct. This is mental evil conduct, these the results for mental evil conduct. Thus its heavenly and human and hellish in the spheres of beasts and ghosts.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, when those to be tamed are not tamed when trained kindly, roughly and also kindly and roughly, what does The Blessed One do to them? Kesi, when those to be tamed do not get tamed when trained kindly, harshly and also kindly and harshly, I kill them. Venerable sir, it is not suitable for The Blessed One to destroy living things, yet The Blessed One says I kill them.</P>
<P>Kesi, it's true, destroying living things is not suitable for the Thus Gone One, if those to be tamed do not tame, when trained kindly, harshly and also kindly and harshly, the Thus Gone One does not think they should be tolerated and adised and wise co-associates in the holy life do not think they should be tolerated and advised. Kesi, it is death in the noble ones' discipline when the Thus Gone and the wise co-associates in the holy life do not think to tolerate and advise.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, isn't it destruction in the well going path, when the Thus Gone One and the wise co-associates in the holy life do not thik to tolerate and advise them. Venerable sir, I am a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.</P>
