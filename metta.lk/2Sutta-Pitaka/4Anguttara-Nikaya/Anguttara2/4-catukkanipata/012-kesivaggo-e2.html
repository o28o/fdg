<P>0nce a trainer of horses, (by name) Kesi, came to where the Exalted One was. Having come he made obeisance to the Exalted One and took a seat at one side. To the horse-trainer Kesi so seated the Exalted One spake thus: </P>
<P>"Indeed, Kesi, you are a skilled' horse-trainer. Kesi, how do you then train a horse that is to be tamed?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, Lord, I train a horse that is to he trained by gentleness, I train by severity and I train both by gentleness and severity."</P>
<P>Then, Kesi, if the horse that is to be tamed does not yield to your training, either by gentleness, or severity, or both gentleness and severity, what do you do to him?</P>
<P>Then, Lord, if the horse does not yield to my training, either by gentleness or severity, or both gentleness and severity, Lord, I destroy him. What is the reason therefor? In order that it may not be a reproach unto the lineage of my teacher. Lord, the Exalted One is indeed</P>

<P>148 The Numerical Sayings [TEXT ii, 117</P>
<P>Brethren, how does the royal elephant become an attentive hearer?</P>
<P>Brethren, herein when the elephant-trainer imposes upon him a task, whether done before or not, the royal elephant, making that his object and applying his mind thereto, with thoughts collected, listens to it with ready ear.

<P>Brethren, how does the royal elephant become an endurer?</P>
<P>Brethren, herein the royal elephant having entered into battle endures * blows with spears, swords, arrows, and axes, also the sounds of drums, kettledrums, conches, tamtams and other kinds of din. Thus, brethren, the royal elephant becomes an endurer.</P>

<P>--------</P>
<P>1 Of. Dhammapada-* The Elephant.' (N&agrave;ga,-Vagga) .</P>
<P>xii. [114] On Kesi 149</P>
<P>Herein, brethren, a brother, when the Norm-discipline set forth by the Tath&agrave;gata is preached, makes that his ohject, and applying his mind thereto listens to the Doctrine with all his heart, attentively, with ready ear. Thus, brethren, a brother is a hearer.</P>
<P>And how, brethren, is a brother a slayer? Herein, brethren, a brother does not welcome a vague lustful thought that has arisen: he rejects it, banishes it, makes an end of it, makes it cease to exist......... So also with regard to a vague thought of harming that has arisen, and any evil unprofitable state of mind that arises from time to time: he rejects it, banishes it, makes an end of it, makes it cease to exist. Even so, brethren, is a brother a slayer.</P>
<P>And how, brethren, is a brother an endurer? Herein, brethren, a brother is patient of cold, heat, hunger, thirst, the touch of flies, mosquitoes, wind and sun and creeping things; of abuse that oversteps the bounds of speech; of feelings that affect the body when they arise, painful, sharp, harsh, bitter, unpleasant, offensive pains that sap one's life- [all these] he endures. Thus, brethren, is a brother an endurer.</P>
<P>And how, brethren, is a brother a goer? Herein, brethren, a brother quickly goes thither-in directions where in this long long journey he has never gone before-to wit: to the calming of all the activities, to the leaving of all basis (for rebirth) , to the destruction of craving, to disgust, to cessation, to Nibbana. Thus, brethren, is a brother a goer.</P>
<P>So, brethren, with these four properties endowed, a brother is worshipful..... a boundless field of merit unsurpassed for the world.</P>
<P>150 The Numerical Sayings [TEXT ii, 118</P>
<P>(5) Four Things</P>
<P>Brethren, there are these four things.' What four? There is a thing, brethren, which is unpleasant to be done, and when done it leads to loss. There is a thing, brethren, which is unpleasant to be done, but when done it leads to gain. There is a thing, brethren, which is pleasant to be done but when done it leads to loss. And there is also a thing, brethren, which is pleasant to be done and when done leads to gain.</P>
<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is unpleasant to be done, which when done leads to loss, such a thing brethren, is in both ways regarded as not to be done.</P>
<P>Whatsoever thing is regarded as unpleasant to be done, on that ground it should be regarded as not to be done. Whatsoever thing when done leads to loss on that ground also it should be regarded as not to be done. This thing, brethren, is in both ways regarded as not to be done.</P>
<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is unpleasant to be done but when done loads to gain, from this thing, brethren, the fool and the wise man should be known, in point of manly strength, manly vigour and manly energy.</P>
<P>Brethren, the fool does not think` This thing, though in a way unpleasant to be done, nevertheless when done leads to gain,' and he does not do it. Such, a thing left undone leads to his loss. But, brethren, the wise man considers thus `This thing, though unpleasant to be done, nevertheless when done leads to gain.' He does such a thing. Such a thing when done leads to his gain.</P>
<P>1 Th&agrave;n&agrave;ni is literally,` places' or `things,' hence stations, `occasions' (not a deed but a possibility of Karma) .</P>
<P>xii. [116] On Kesi 151</P>
<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is pleasant to be done, but when done leads to loss, from this thing, brethren, the fool and the wise man should be known, in point of manly strength, manly vigour and manly energy.</P>
<P>Brethren, the fool does not think: ` This thing though pleasant to be done nevertheless when done leads to loss.' He does it. Such a thing when done leads to loss.</P>
<P>The wise man however thinks thus: ` This thing though pleasant to be done nevertheless when done leads to loss.' He does not do it. Such a thing left undone leads to gain.</P>
<P>Among these, brethren, whatsoever thing is pleasant to be done and when done leads to gain, such a thing, brethren, is to be regarded in both ways as worthy to be done: because such a thing is pleasant to be done, on this ground it is regarded as fit to be done; and, because such a thing when done leads to gain, on this ground also it is to be regarded as fit to be done. Such a thing therefore, brethren, is regarded in both ways as fit to be done.</P>
<P>Verily, brethren, there are these four things.</P>
<P>(6) Earnestness*</P>
<P>Brethren, earnestness should be shown in four things In what four?</P>

<P>(7) Earnestness and Mindfulness</P>
<P>Brethren, in four ways should earnestness, mindfulness and guard of thoughts be promoted by* oneself. What four?</P>
<P>May my mind not be defiled by lustful thoughts '; thus should earnestness, mindfulness and guard of thoughts be promoted by oneself. ` May my mind not be defiled by hateful thoughts thus should earnestness, mindfulness, and guard of thoughts be promoted by oneself. ` May my mind not be defiled by delusive thoughts': thus should earnestness, mindfulness and guard of thoughts be promoted by oneself. ` May my mind not be crushed by intoxicating thoughts,' thus should earnestness, mindfulness and guard of thoughts be promoted by oneself.</P>
<P>Whatsoever brother owing to absence of lust has not defiled his mind with lustful thoughts, and owing to absence of hate has not defiled his mind with hateful thoughts, and owing to absence of delusion has not defiled his mind with delusive thoughts, and owing to absence of intoxication has not crushed his mind with intoxicating thoughts, neither fears, trembles, shivers or is terrified, nor is he misled by the words of the ascetics."</P>
<P>-----------</P>
<P>1 Or about death.</P>
<P>2 Atta-r&aring;pena (atta-bhvo) - `one's own personal'.</P>
<P>3 Samana-vacanena-the Samanas are here heretics or non-Buddhists but the word is generally used in an honourable sense.</P>
<P>xii. [118) On Kesi 153</P>
<P>(8) Holy Places</P>
<P>Brethren, these four places should be seen by the faithful clansman and they should rouse his emotion. What four?

Brethren, here the Accomplished One won supreme Enlightenment.thus this place when seen should rouse emotion in the faithful clansman. Brethren, here the Accomplished One set rolling the Supreme Wheel of Righteousness: thus this plate when seen should arouse emotion in the faithful clansman. Brethren, here the Accomplished One passed away without leaving any remaining cause of rebirth: thus this place When seen should rouse ciuotion in the faithful clansman.</P>
<P>Verily, brethren, these four places wheia seen by the faithful clanswa-n should rouse emotion in him.</P>
<P>(9) Fears (a) </P>
<P>Brethren, there are four (causes of) fear. What four? Fear of birth, fear of decay, fear of disease and fear of death. These indeed, brethren, are four (causes of) fear.</P>
