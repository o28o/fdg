<P>Bhikkhus, what is fear of blame from the self?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain one reflects thus- If I misconduct by body by words and mind, those actions tell tales about my virtues. He frigthtened of blame from the self dispels bodily misconduct and develops bodily right conduct, dispels verbal misconduct and develops verbal right conduct, dispels mental misconduct and develops mental right conduct.

Cutting hands, cutting feet, cutting hands and feet. Cutting the ears, cutting the nose, cutting ears and nose. Putting in the gruel pot, giving the shell tonsure, putting in Rahu's mouth, garlanding with a flaming garland, burning the hands with a torch, beating until the body is like straw, making to behave like an antelope, hooking the flesh, cutting squares out of flesh, burning in an alkaline solution, driving a spike from ear to ear to turn, making like a straw foot stool, sprinkling boiling oil on the body, giving to the dogs to be eaten, raising on a pole until death and also cutting the neck. Then it occurs to him the king punishes the highwayman or the robber in various ways for his evil actions and if I do evil actions the same will be done to me, such as whipping, beating with the, jungle rope, poisoned stick. Cutting hands, cutting feet, cutting hands and feet. Cutting the ears, cutting the nose, cutting ears and nose.

<P>Here, bhikkhus, a certain person secluding from sensual desires and demeritorious thoughts, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion attains to the first higher state of mind. Enjoying it, longing for it, he attains prosperity in it. Keenly applying himself to it, making much of it and not decreasing from it, he dies and is born with the gods of the sphere of Brahma. The life span of those gods is a forward world cycle. Finishing his complete life span there, he would either be born in hell, as a beast, or as a ghost. As for the noble disciples of The Blessed One, they would finish the complete life span there and would extinguish in that same birth. Bhikkhus, this is the difference and diversity between the learned noble disciple and the not learned ordinary man in their course of action, birth and conscience.</P>
