ON FEARS</P>
<P>(1) Fears (a) </P>
<P>BRETHREN, there are these four kinds of fear. What four? Fear of self-censure, fear of censure by others, fear of punishment and fear of rebirth in states of woe.</P>
<P>Brethren, what is fear of self-censure? Herein, brethren, a certain person thus considers `Were I indeed to commit misconduct by body, by word or by thought, how can I not morally blame myself for such act?' Thus frightened by self-censure, he eschews misconduct by body and promotes good conduct by body and so forth and leads a pure life. Brethren, this is said to be fear of self-censure (conscience).</P>
<P>Brethren, what is fear of censure by others? Herein, brethren, a certain person considers thus: 1 Were 1 indeed to commit misconduct by body, by word or by thought, how can others not morally blame me for such act?' Thus, frightened of censure by others, he eschews misconduct by body and the like, and promotes good conduct by body and so forth, and leads a pure life. Brethren, this is said to be fear of censure by others.'</P>
<P>-------------</P>
<P>1. These first two states are summed up in the word Itiri-ottappam.</P>
<P>xiii. [121] On Fears 155</P>
<P>Brethren, what is fear of punishment? Herein, brethren, a certain person sees a thief guilty of a crime being taken by the king* and subjected to various kinds of punishments such as: lashing with whips and canes, beating with split sticks," cutting off of arm or leg, both arms and logs, ear or nose, both ear and nose, ripping skull and applying a red-hot iron,' skimming the scalp [and applying gravel till it becomes white as a chank].4</P>
<P>Burning the inside of the mouth,* the body and the band. Flaying the skin off from throat to ankle, from neck to waist and from waist to ankle. Fixing the elbows and knees to iron piles and nailing them, and lighting fires around. Flaying the skin, flesh and veins with a sharp edge, tearing the body and smearing the wounds with salt water.</P>
<P>Fixing the body on the ground by laying it prostrate on one side and planting an iron rod through the ears on the ground, then whirling the body round. Crushing and softening the body like a bunch of straw.' Pouring boiling oil on the body; making it a prey to hungry dogs. Impaling it whilst alive and severing the head with a sword.</P>
<P>Then he considers thus: ` Were I to commit a similar crime, I should also be taken up by the king, who would</P>

<P>156 The Numerical Sayings TEXT ii, 123</P>
<P>punish me in various ways such as the above, oven as an offending thief in consequence of a crime is apprehended by the king and punished in various ways, such as the above mentioned.' Thus frightened of punishment, he lives without stealing others' property.</P>
<P>Brethren, this is said to be the fear of punishment.</P>
<P>Brethren, what is the fear of states of woe Herein, brethren, a certain person considers thus: ` Verily, there is the bad result of misconduct by body, word and thought, in the world to come; were I to commit misconduct by body, word and thought, how should 1, on the dissolution of the body after death, be not reborn in a state of woe, suffering punishment and in the hells?</P>
<P>Thus frightened by the states of woe he eschews misconduct by body, word and thought and promotes good conduct by body, word and thought and leads a pure life.</P>
<P>Brethren, this is said to be fear of states of woe.</P>
<P>Verily, brethren, there are these four (kinds of) fear.</P>
<P>(2) Fears (b) </P>
<P>Brethren, there are these four kinds of fear that should be expected by the person who descends into water. What four? Fear of waves, fear of crocodiles, fear of whirlpools and fear of fierce fishes. Brethren, he wh descends into water should expect these four (kinds of) fear.</P>
<P>Likewise, brethren, here in this doctrine and discipline when a certain clansman wanders forth out of the home</P>
<P>------------</P>
<P>1 Duggati = `the way of woe.'</P>
<P>2 Cf. Majjima, I, 459, (Tr.0</P>
<P>xiii. [ 122] On Fears 157</P>
<P>into the homeless state, he should expect four (kinds of) fear. What four? Fear of waves, of crocodiles, of whirlpools and of fierce fishes.</P>
<P>Brethren, what is fear of waves? Herein, brethren, a certain clansman through faith wanders forth out of the home into the homeless state (and thinks thus) : I am a victim to birth, decay, death, grief, wailing, pain, distress and tribulation, and am overcome by pain. Good indeed if I could see the ending of this whole mass of pain.' His co-mates in the holy life then exhort and instruct him who has so gone forth as follows: 'Thus should you go forward, thus should you go backward, thus should you look forward, thus should you look backward, thus should you draw in or stretch out (your limbs) and thus should you bear robe, mantle and bowl.'</P>
<P>Then he thus considers: ` Indeed. when at home formerly we ourselves exhorted and instructed others, but now we are like unto our sons and grandsons, and they think we should be exhorted and instructed.' Thus angered and offended he altogether abandons the training and takes again to the layman's life.</P>
<P>Brethren, this brother frightened by the tear of waves is said to abandon the training and to take again to the layman's life. Indeed, brethren, fear of waves is a simile of the state of being pervaded by anger.</P>
<P>Brethren, this is said to be the fear of waves.</P>
<P>Brethren, what is the fear of crocodiles? Heroin, brethren, a certain clansman [as before]. His co-mates in the holy life then exhort and instruct him who has so gone forth as follows Thus should you eat and thus should</P>
<P>--------------</P>

<P>158 The Numerical Sayings [TEXT ii, 125</P>
<P>you not eat food solid or soft; thus should you taste and not taste; thus should you drink and not drink; you should eat proper and not improper food, solid or soft. You should taste what is proper and not what is improper; you should drink what is proper and not what is improper; you should drink at the right time and not at the wrong time. You should eat solid or soft food at the right time not the wrong time.'</P>
<P>Then he considers thus: ` When indeed we wore formerly in the home we ate what we wished, we tasted what we wished, we drank what we wished; what we wished not we did not eat, taste or drink; we ate, tasted and drank both what is proper and improper, also at the right time and after proper hours.</P>
<P>Whenever faithful householders during the day after proper hours do not offer delicious food hard or soft, he thinks that they are imposing (upon him) a prohibition against eating. So he abandons the training and falls back into the layman's life.</P>
<P>Brethren, thus a brother frightened of crocodiles is said to fall back into the layman's life, abandoning the training. Verily, brethren, the fear of crocodiles is a simile of gluttony. Brethren, this is said to be the fear of crocodiles.</P>
<P>Brethren, what is the fear of whirlpools?</P>
<P>Herein, brothren, a certain clansman owing to faith leaves the life. of home and wanders forth into the homeless state and thinks thus: ` I am a victim [as before].' Having thus gone forth, at dawn he dresses himself, and taking bowl and robe enters a town or a village, unguarded in body, word and thought, with attention unfixed and</P>
<P>xiii. [ 122] On Fears 159</P>
<P>senses uncontrolled. There he sees a householder or his son possessed of, and gratified by, the five pleasures of sense. Then he thinks thus: </P>
<P>We indeed formerly when at home were possessed of, and gratified by, the five pleasures of sense. We had the wealth of the family and could enjoy it and do acts of merit. Let me now forsake the training, go back to the layman's life, enjoy my possessions and do acts of merit.' He thus forsakes the training and falls back into the layman's life.</P>
<P>Brethren, thus a brother frightened by the fear of whirlpools is said to fall back to the layman's life. Verily, brethren, fear of whirlpools is a metaphor for the five pleasures of sense. This is said to be the fear of whirlpools.</P>
<P>Brethren, what is the fear of fierce fishes?</P>
<P>Herein, brethren, a certain clansman through faith leaves the family life and wanders forth into the homeless state and thinks thus I am a victim [as above]'........ with senses uncontrolled.</P>
<P>There he sees a woman not properly clad or covered, and lust fastens on his heart. So degraded by lust he forsakes the training and falls back into the layman's life.</P>
<P>Brethren, a brother frightened by the fear of fierce fishes is thus said to abandon the training and to fall back into the layman's life. Verily, brethren, fear of fierce fishes is a simile of woman. This is said to. be the fear of fierce fishes.</P>
<P>In sooth, brethren, these are the four (kinds of) fear, which certain clansman, who, through faith in this doctrine and discipline, wander forth from the life of home to the homeless life, should expect.</P>

<P>(3) The Raptures (a) </P>
<P>There are these four persons to be found existing in the world. What four?</P>
<P>Herein, brethren, a certain person abstaining from sensual desires and from sinful acts enters on and remains in the First Rapture,! wherein there is ecstasy and serenity resulting from seclusion. He longs for it, tastes and enters into the joy of it, he takes his stand thereon, applies applies himself to it, dwells incessantly on it, and without falling away from it departs from this life and is reborn among the Brahma-K&agrave;yika Devas." ' Brethren, the span of lifetime of the Brahma-Kflyika Devas is an aeon.</P>
<P>There, if a worldling, he lives as long as life lasts, and having spent the whole span of life of such Devas, passes on either to purgatory, animal life, or the state of ghosts.</P>
<P>But the disciples of the Exalted One indeed live therein as long as life lasts, and having spent the whole span of life of such Devas, in that state itself pass away to Nibb&agrave;na."</P>
<P>Verily, brethren, this is the difference, this is the distinction, and this is the peculiarity of the learned Ariyan disciple and the ignorant worldling. This is their quality and nature.</P>
<P>And again, brethren, herein a certain person, freeing the wind from reflection and investigation and having it concentrated, retaining the joy consequent on the tranquillity</P>

<P>of mind enters on and abides in the Second Rapture, which is freed alike from reflection and investigation. He longs for it, tastes and enters into the joy of it, he takes his stand thereon, applies himself to it, dwells incessantly on it, and without falling away from it, departs from this life and is reborn among the Abhassara Devas.</P>
<P>Brethren, the span of life-time of the Abhassara Devas is two aeons. There if a worldling he lives as long as life lasts, and having spent the whole span of life of such Devas passes on either to purgatory, to animal life or to the states of the ghosts.</P>
<P>The disciples of the Exalted One indeed live therein as long as life lasts, and having spent the whole span of life of such Devas in that state itself pass away to Nibbana.</P>
<P>Verily, brethren, this is the difference, this is the distinction and this is the peculiarity of the learned Arian disciple and the ignorant worldling. This is their quality and nature.</P>
<P>And again, brethren, a certain person dwells in joy,, passionlessness and equanimity, and thoughtful and conscious, enjoys felicity of body. The holy ones declare this thoughtful person dwelling at ease in equanimity to have entered on the Third Rapture. He longs for it, tastes and enters into the joy of it, he takes his stand thereon, applies himself to it, dwells incessantly on it, and without falling away from it departs from this life and is reborn among the Subhaki&otilde;ha Devas.* The life-span of the Subhaki&otilde;ha gods is four aeons.

<P>Verily, brethren, this the difference, this is the distinction and this the peculiarity of the learned Ariyan disciple and the ignorant worldling. This is their quality and nature.</P>
<P>And again, brethren, a certain person, divesting himself of pleasure and pain and primarily freeing himself from happiness and sorrow arrives at and remains in the Fourth Raptur- a state of mind indifferent alike to all emotion. He longs for it, tastes and enters into the joy of it, he takes his stand thereon, applies himself to it, dwells incessantly on it and without falling away from it departs from this life and is reborn among the Vehapphala gods.*</P>
<P>Brethren, the life-span of the Vehapphala Devas is five hundred aeons. There if a worldling he lives as long as life lasts, and having spent the whole span of life of such Devas, passes on either to purgatory, to animal life, or the state of the ghosts.

<P>Heroin, brethren, a certain person abstaining from sensual pleasures (as above) enters on and abides in the First Rapture. Then indeed he thinks here there is form, feeling, perception, conformations, consciousness and he perceives them as transitory, painful, subject to disease; as an imposthume, a dart, suffering, illness; and as something alien, subject to decay, empty and soulless. Upon the dissolution of the body, after death, he is reborn among the Suddh&agrave;vasa * Devas. Brethren, this kind of rebirth is not shared by the worldlings.</P>
