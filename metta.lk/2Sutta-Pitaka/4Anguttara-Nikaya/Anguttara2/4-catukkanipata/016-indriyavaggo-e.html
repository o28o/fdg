It is not for play, intoxication, decoration or to look beautiful. It is taken to uphold the body, without greed for soups, as a help to lead the holy life. Thus I destroy the earlier feelings and do not arouse any new. May there be no faults, for my comfortable abiding In the meantime relying on food he dispels food.

Then it occurs to him: When will I destroy desires, release my mind from desires and released through wisdom here and now abide having realized by myself.
