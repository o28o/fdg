<P>Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, I have declared a lot of the Teaching -discourses, prose and verse sections, question and answer explanations, verses, solemn utterances, thus said sayings, birth stories, wonderful things and series of questions and answers.

<P>Good Gotama, at one time the associates of the Brahmin Todeyya aroused a hostility to king Eleyya. King Eleyya is foolish that he is pleased with the recluse Ramaputta. He reveres the recluse Ramaputta in the form of worshipping, attending on, clasping the hands in veneration and maintaining a mutual understanding.
