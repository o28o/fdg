ON THE WARRIOR</P>
<P>(1) The Warrior</P>
<P>BRETHREN, a warrior possessed of four qualities becomes worthy of the king, a royal property, and is reckoned as an asset to the king. What four?</P>
<P>Herein, brethren, a warrior is skilled in the knowledge of vantage-positions, shoots far, shoots as quick as lightning and pierces huge objects.* Verily, brethren, a warrior possessed of these four qualities becomes worthy of the king, a royal property, and is reckoned as an asset to the king.</P>
<P>Likewise a brother possessed of four qualities becomes worthy of offerings (and so forth) *, a supreme field of merit to the world. What four?</P>
<P>Brethren, herein, a brother is skilled in vantage-positions, shoots far, shoots as quick as lightning, and pierces huge objects. How does a brother becomes skilled in vantage-positions?*</P>
<P>Herein, a brother is of good conduct (and so forth) and observes the precepts of training. Verily, such a brother is skilled in vantage-positions.</P>

<P>222 The Numerical Sayings [TEXT ii, 171</P>
<P>Brethren, how does a brother become an archer who shoots far?</P>
<P>Herein, brethren, a brother sees things with the eye of insight as they really are, and regards them thus: `This indeed is not my body, feelings, perception, activities or consciousness. This I am not, and this is not my soul, whether all such body (and so forth) be past, present or future, subjective or objective, gross or subtle, low or high, far or near.' Verily, brethren, such a brother is like unto an archer who shoots far.</P>
<P>Brethren, how does a brother become an archer who shoots as quick as lightning? Herein, brethren, a brother knows as it really is: ` This is Ill, this is Ill's cause, this is Ill's Cessation and this is the Path leading to Ill's Cessation.' Verily, brethren, such a brother is one who shoots as quick as lightning.</P>
<P>Brethren, how does a brother become an archer who pierces huge objects? Herein, brethren, a brother pierces the huge mass of ignorance. Verily, brethren, such a brother is an archer who pierces huge objects.</P>
<P>Truly a brother who is possessed of these four qualities becomes worthy of offerings (and so forth) a supreme field of merit to the world.</P>
<P>(2) Surety*1</P>
<P>Brethren, there is no one in the whole world who may be assured against four things, be he recluse or br&agrave;hmin deva, M&agrave;ra or Brahm&agrave;. What four things?</P>
<P>--------------</P>
<P>1 Discussed at Eath&agrave;vatthu, &uuml; 456 (on iddhi) .</P>

<P>To prevent the ageing * of what must age, there is no one in the world, be he recluse, br&agrave;hmin, deva, M&agrave;ra or Brahm&agrave; who can be assured.</P>
<P>To prevent the falling sick of what is sickly by nature to prevent the fading out of what must die; to prevent the ripening of the fruits of whatsoever sinful conditions, defiling conditions, such as lead down to rebirth, unhappy conditions that result in future birth, decay and death,against this there is no one in the world who may be assured, be he recluse, or br&agrave;hmin, deva, M&agrave;ra or Brahm&agrave;.</P>
<P>Verily, brethren, there is no one in the world who may be assured against these four things.</P>
<P>(3) Vassak&agrave;ra</P>
<P>Once the Exalted One dwelt in Squirrels' Feeding Ground in Bamboo Grove at R&agrave;jagaha. Then Vassak&agrave;ra*, the br&agrave;hmin chief minister of Magadha, came to the Exalted One. and said: </P>
<P>"Master Gotama, I say this, I am of this opinion whosoever tells what he has seen (saying) this I have seen,' there is no fault therein. Whosoever tells what he has heard, felt or known (saying) thus and thus have I heard, sensed and thought,' there is no fault therein."</P>
<P>"But I, br&agrave;hmin, say that one should not tell everything he has seen, heard, sensed or thought. Indeed, br&agrave;hmin, if in him who tells what he has seen, heard, sensed or thought sinful conditions increase and meritorious conditions</P>

<P>224 The Numerical Sayings [TEXT ii, 173</P>
<P>diminish, then I say that such a thing seen, heard, sensed or thought should not be told. But if in him who tells what he has seen, heard, sensed or thought sinful conditions decrease and meritorious conditions increase, I say such a thing seen, heard, sensed or thought should be told."</P>
<P>Then Vassak&agrave;ra, the br&agrave;hmin, chief minister of Magadha, approved of and rejoiced at the words of the Exalted One, rose from his seat and departed thence.</P>
<P>(11) J&agrave;nussoni</P>
<P>Once J&agrave;nussoni, the br&agrave;hmin, came to the Exalted One and said: </P>
<P>" Master Gotama, I say this, I am of this opinion: There is indeed no one who, being subject to death, fears not and trembles not at death?</P>
<P>"Nay! br&agrave;hmin, there is one who, being subject to death, fears and trembles at death. Also there is one who, subject to death, fears not and trembles not at death.</P>
<P>Brahmin, who is he that being subject to death fears and trembles at death?</P>
<P>Herein, br&agrave;hmin, a certain one has not rid himself of clinging to sensual desires nor dispelled desire, affection, thirst, burning and craving; he is then stricken by a certain dire disease. To him thus stricken by a dire disease this thought occurs `Pleasant sensual enjoyments will now indeed forsake me, and I shall have to forsake pleasant sensual enjoyments.' Thus he mourns, is troubled, wails and weeps, beating his breast, and so becomes bewildered. Verily, brahmin, this is he who, being subject to death, fears and trembles at death.</P>
<P>XIX. 184] On the Warrior 225</P>
<P>Again, br&agrave;hmin, herein a certain one has done no good and meritorious deeds, nor protected those who are in fear, but has done sinful acts, cruelties and wrongs. This man is stricken by a certain dire disease. To him thus stricken by a dire disease this thought occurs` Alas! I have done no good and meritorious deeds, nor protected those who are in fear, but have done sinful acts, cruelties and wrongs, My friend, whatsoever may be the fate of those who have done no good and meritorious deeds, nor protected those who are in fear, and have done sinful acts, cruelties and wrongs, I shall hereafter go to that state.' Thus he mourns, is troubled, wails and weeps, beating his breast and so becomes bewildered. Verily, br&agrave;hmin, this is he who, being subject to death, fears and trembles at death.</P>
<P>Again, br&agrave;hmin, a certain one is wavering and doubting and has not attained to perfection in the Norm; he is then stricken by a certain dire disease. To him so stricken this thought occurs: `Alas! I have been wavering and doubting and did not attain to perfection in the Norm.' Thus he mourns, is troubled, wails and weeps, beating his breast and so becomes bewildered. Verily, br&agrave;hmin, this is he who, being subject to death, fears and trembles at death.</P>
<P>In truth, br&agrave;hmin, those four persons, being subject to death, fear and tremble at death.</P>
<P>But who, br&agrave;hmin, is the one that, being subject to death, does not fear nor tremble at death?</P>
<P>[Repeat the opposite of what was said above of the same four,persons.]</P>

<P>(5) Standard Truths</P>
<P>Once the Exalted One dwelt at R&agrave;jagaha on Vulture's Peak hill At that time also there dwelt in the Wanderers' 'Park on the banks of Sappini' many wel1 known wanderers,* namely Annabh&agrave;ra, Varadhara, Sakulud&agrave;yi and other well known wanderers.</P>
<P>Then at eventide the Exalted One, rising from His solitude, came to the Wanderers' Park on the banks of Sappini. Now at that time among these wanderers of other views, as they sat together in assembly, this conversation arose: " The standard * truths are these. The standard truths are these."</P>
<P>Just then the Exalted One came to where the wanderers were. Having so come He sat down on the seat prepared for Him. So seated the Exalted One spake thus to the wanderers: </P>
<P>"On what talk, wanderers, are ye here and now engaged us ye sit together, and what talk between you have I interrupted?"</P>
<P>"Herein, Master Gotama, among us seated together in this assembly this talk arose: ` The standard truths are these. The standard truths are these."'</P>

<P>[The Lord replied]"0, wanderers, there are these four standard truths, which I myself have fully known, realised and declared. What four?</P>
<P>Herein, wanderers, the br&agrave;hmin says thus: All life is inviolable.*" The br&agrave;hmin who says thus speaks truth, not falsehood. Therefore he does not boast that he is a recluse, he does not boast that he is a br&agrave;hmin, he does not boast: `I am a better man; there is none like unto me; I am inferior to none.' Moreover, fully knowing the truth thereof he has practised mercy and compassion towards all living beings.</P>
<P>Again, wanderers, the br&agrave;hmin says thus: ` All sensual delights are transitory, painful and subject to the law of change.' The br&agrave;hmin * who says thus speaks truth and not falsehood. Therefore he does not boast..... (as above) . Moreover, fully knowing the truth thereof, he has practised aversion, dispassion and cessation of sense-delights.</P>
<P>Again, wanderers, the br&agrave;hmin says thus: ` All forms of existence are transitory, painful and subject to the law of change.' The br&agrave;hmin who knows this speaks truth and not falsehood. Therefore he does not boast ... (as above) . Moreover, fully knowing the truth thereof he has practised aversion, dispassion and cessation of all forms of existence.</P>
<P>Again, wanderers. the br&agrave;hmin says thus: `I am not associated with anything, and therein for me there is no attachment to anything.' The br&agrave;hmin who says thus speaks truth and not falsehood. Therefore ... (as above) .</P>

<P>228 The Numerical Sayings [TEXT ii, 177</P>
<P>Moreover, fully perceiving the truth, he has practised the habit of not possessing anything.</P>
<P>Verily, wanderers, these four standard truth,,; I have myself fully known, realised and made known."</P>
<P>(6) The World</P>
<P>Once a certain brother came to where.the Exalted One was, sat down at one side, and said thus: </P>
<P>"Lord, by whom is the world* led?* By whom is the world. pulled* along? Under whose sway arisen doth it go on *?</P>
<P>"Excellent ` excellent!, brother! Apt is thy penetration, * apt thy wit. A proper question, brother! So thou dost ask me: ;Lord, by whom is the world led? By whom is the world pulled along? Under whose sway arisen doth it go on?</P>
<P>" do, Lord "</P>
<P>"Indeed, brother, the world is led by mind, ' is pulled along by mind, under mind's sway arisen doth it go on."</P>
<P>-------------</P>
<P>1 Lolo means `a being' as well as` the outer world'.</P>
<P>2 Niyyati.</P>
<P>3 Parikissati.</P>
<P>4 Vasa&uuml; gacchati.</P>
<P>5 Ummaggo(penitration) =pa中a (ace.to Buddhagh.) . Cf. Sn. A.50 (often on a devious path or wrong view) . See S. V. 171 for a similar reply of the Buddha, where the question is one Bhadda,bhikkuni, and the word bhaddaka is a pun on his name. He says to him: </P>
<P>S&agrave;dhu, &agrave;vuso Bhadda, bhaddaka, kho te &agrave;vuso ummaggo, bhaddacam patibh&agrave;nam-'Well done, friend Welcome, welcome indeed is your wit, welcome is your penetration.'</P>
<P>6 Cf. S. ii, 39. A. iv, 186: Dhp., i. manopubbangam&agrave; dhamm&agrave; etc. (The keynote of Buddhist thought) .</P>
<P>XIX. 186] On the Warrior 229</P>
<P>"Excellent indeed, Lord! said that brother and approved and rejoiced at the word of the Exalted One. Then he asked a further question of the Exalted One: "Lord, [there is the saying] ` learned and well versed in the Norm.' Pray, Lord, in what respect is one learned and well versed in the Norm?</P>
<P>"Excellent! Excellent, brother ` Apt is thy penetration, apt thy wit. A proper question, brother ` So thou askest me this: [Repeat the question.]</P>
<P>" I do, Lord! "</P>
<P>" Indeed ' brother, numerous are the teachings declared by me, thus: sermons in prose, sermons in verse and prose, exposition, songs, solemn sayings, my own utterances, stories of (former) births, talks about the supernormal, discourses long and short of diverse nature.' But, even if a brother were to know the meaning and the text of a single stanza of four lines and has reached the complete righteousness of the Norm, 'he deserves to be called learned and well versed."</P>
<P>"Excellent indeed, Lord!1 " said that brother and approved and rejoiced at the word of the Exalted One. Then he asked a further question of Him: " Lord, one is said to be learned and of penetrating wisdom. Pray, Lord, in what respect is one learned and of penetrating wisdom? "</P>
<P>"Excellent! Excellent, brother! Apt is thy penetration [as above]."</P>
<P>Herein, brother, a brother has heard "This is Ill' and recognises its meaning in all details: ` This is Ill's cause',and recognises its meaning in all details this is Ill's cessation,' and recognises its meaning in all details: ` this</P>
<P>1 The navangas of Buddha-sasana. Of. Majjh. i, 133.</P>
<P>230 The ivumerical Sayings [TFXT ii, 179</P>
<P>is the Path leading to the cessation of Ill and recognises its meaning in all details. Verily, brother, such an one is learned and of penetrating wisdom."</P>
<P>"Excellent, indeed, Lord! " said that brother and approved and rejoiced at the word of the Exalted One. then he asked a further question of Him: "Lord, one is said to be a sage and of great wisdom. Pray, Lord, in what respect is one a sage and of great wisdom?</P>
<P>"Excellent! Excellent, brother ` Apt is thy penetration [as above].</P>
<P>Herein, brother, a sage and a person of great wisdom thinks neither of injury to himself,* nor injury to others, nor injury to both; but always thinks of only his own good, the good of others, the good of both and the good of the whole world. Verily, brother, this is a sage and a person of great wisdom."</P>
<P>(7) Vassak&agrave;ra</P>
<P>Once, the Exalted One dwelt at the Squirrels' FeedingGround in Bamboo Grove near R&agrave;jagaha. Now, Vassak&agrave;ra, the br&agrave;hmin, chief minister of Magadha, came to where the Exalted One was ... sat down at one side, and said thus: " Pray, Master Gotama, does a wicked man know a wicked man (so as to say) ` this is a wicked man?"</P>
<P>"Indeed, br&agrave;hmin, it is impossible that a wicked man should know a wicked man (so as to say) : `this is a wicked man."'</P>

<P>2 Bhava&uuml;,=,puggalo,,puriso, but more polite.</P>
<P>XIX. &uuml; 187] On the Warrior 231</P>
<P>"Master Gotama, does a wicked man know a good man (so as to say) : `This is a good man?</P>
<P>"Indeed, br&agrave;hmin, it is impossible that a wicked man should know a good man (so as to say) : ` this is a good man.'"</P>
<P>"Then, Master Gotama, does a good man know a good man (so as to say) : ` this is a good man?"</P>
<P>"Verily, br&agrave;hmin, there appears a possibility that a good man should know a good man (so as to say) : `this is a good man.'</P>
<P>"Master Gotama, does a good man know a wicked man (so as to say) : ` this is a wicked man.'"</P>
<P>"Indeed, br&agrave;hmin, there appears a possibility that a good man should know a wicked man (so as to say) : ` this is a wicked man."'</P>
<P>"0 wonderful, Master Gotama! 0 marvellous Master Gotama! This has been well said by Master Gotama [repeat]. Now, Master Gotama, on a certain occasion, the followers of Todeyya, the br&agrave;hmin, spoke in reproach (saying) "This King Eleyya is a fool, for, having great faith in the recluse R&agrave;maputta, he shows him such excessive obedience, such as devotion, reverence, respectful salutation, and due observance. Moreover, these attendants of King Eleyya are also fools, namely; Yamaka, Moggala, Ugga, N&agrave;vindaki, Gandhabba, and Aggivessa; for, having faith in the recluse R&agrave;maputta, they also show him such excessive obedience, to wit: devotion, reverence, respectful salutation and due observance. *</P>
<P>Now, thus and thus does this br&agrave;hmin Todeyya teach."</P>

<P>232 The Numerical Saysings [TEXT ii, 180</P>
<P>[The Buddha said] " What think you, good friend? Is King Eleyya a wise man and pre-eminent among those who do great 'deeds, make great pronouncements, and master</P>
<P>deep meanings'?</P>
<P>"So it is, Lord. King Eleyya is a wise man and preeminent among those who do great deeds, make great pronouncements and master deep meanings."</P>
<P>"Then, my good friend, it is because the recluse R&agrave;maputta is wiser than the wise King Eleyya and more pre-eminent among those who do great deeds, make great pronouncements and master deep meanings, that King Eleyya having a great faith in the recluse R&agrave;maputta shows him such excessive obedience, to wit: devotion, reverence, respectful salutation, and due observance.</P>
<P>Now, good friend, what think you? Are the attendants of King Eleyya, namely, Yamaka, Moggalla, Ugga, N&agrave;vindaki, Gandhabba and Aggivessa, wise and pre-eminent among those who do great deeds, make great pronouncements and master deep meanings?</P>
<P>Yes, indeed, Master Gotama, such are the attendants of King Eleyya."</P>
<P>" Then, my good friend, the recluse R&agrave;maputta is wiser than the wise attendants of King Eleyya, and pre-eminent among those who do great deeds, make great pronouncements and master deep meanings. That is why the attendants of King Eleyya, having great faith in the recluse R&agrave;maputta, show him such excessive obedience and so forth."</P>
<P>"0 wonderful Master Gotama! 0 marvellous, Master Gotama! Well said is it by Master Gotama, to wit: </P>
<P>1 Alam-attha-dasataro.</P>
<P>xix. [188] On the Warrior 233</P>
<P>Indeed, br&agrave;hmin, it is impossible that a wicked man should know a wicked man (so as to say) this is a wicked man. Also br&agrave;hrnin, it is impossible that a wicked man should know a good man (so as to say) This is a good man." Indeed, br&agrave;hmin there appears a possibility that a good man. should know a good man (so as to say) This is a good man." Also, br&agrave;hmin, there appears a possibility that a good man should know a wicked man (so as to say) this is a wicked man.Well! Master Gotama, we must take leave of Thee. We have much to do. We are busy folk."</P>
<P>"Well, br&agrave;hmin, do what you think proper and seasonable."</P>
<P>Then the brahmin Vassakara, chief minister of Magadha, was pleased at and approved of the words of the Exalted One, and rose from his seat and departed thence.</P>
<P>(8) Upaka</P>
<P>Once the Exalted One dwelt on Vulture's Peak in R&agrave;jagaha. Then Upaka,* the son,of Mandik&agrave;, came to the Exalted One, sat down at one side, and spake thus to Him: </P>
<P>"Lord, I sav this, I am of this opinion: 'whoso sets going abusive slander and in doing so cannot make good his case in every point ' and fails to make it good thereby becomes blameworthy and censurable."'</P>
<P>---------</P>
<P>1 The polite formula of dismissal, yassa d&agrave;ni k&agrave;lam ma中asi.</P>
<P>2 Upaka was a disciple of Devadatta (the schismatic) and he came with a view to induce the Buddha to speak ill of Devadatta, and thus to accuse Him then and there.</P>

<P>234 The Numerical Sayings [TEXT ii, 182</P>
<P>"Upaka, if a person sets going abusive slander and in doing so cannot make good his case in every point. and fails to make good, he thereby becomes blameworthy and censurable. But you yourself, Upaka, do this and thereby become blameworthy and censurable."</P>
<P>"0 Lord, it is just as if one were to bind with a strong noose the neck of a man just as he puts up*his head [from the water], even so, Lord, just as I put up my head the Exalted One caught me in the strong noose of controversy"</P>
<P>In truth, Upaka, I have declared this is wrongful, and therein without limit are the words, without limit are the letters and without limit is the teaching of the Accomplished One, to this effect: 'This is sin: this sin should be -----eschewed.' Thus was it declared by me, Upaka herein without limit is the teaching of the Accomplished One to this effect `Thus this sin should be eschewed.'</P>
<P>In truth, Upaka, I have declared this to be good ... This is good, also this good should be practised.' ' Thus was it declared by me, Upaka (as above) ."</P>
<P>Then Upaka, the son of Mandik&agrave;, rejoiced at and approved of the words of the Exalted One and rose from his seat, made obeisance to Him by the right * and came to the King of Magadha, Aj&agrave;tasattu, the son of Vedehi.Having so come, he related all the talk he had had with the Exalted One. Whereupon the king of Magadha,Aj&agrave;tasattu, the son of Vedehi, became angry and displeased and said to Upaka, the son of Mandik&agrave;: </P>

<P>Brethren, there are these four things to be realised. What four?</P>
<P>Brethren, there are things to be realised by the mind-body.' There are things that should be realised by memory.. There are things that should be realised by the (divine) eye. There are things that should be realised by insight.</P>
<P>Brethren, what are the things that should be realised by the mind-body? The eightfold deliverance is to be realised by the mind-body.</P>
<P>Brethren, what are the things that should be realised by memory? One's former states of existence should be realised by memory.</P>
<P>Brethren, what are the things that should be realised by the (divine) eye? The birth and death of living beings should be realised by the (divine) eye.</P>
<P>Brethren, what are the things that should be realised by insight? The extinction of the intoxicants should be realised by insight.</P>
<P>Verily, brethren, these four things are to be realised.</P>

<P>236 The Numerical Sayings [TEXT ii, 183</P>
<P>certain sabbath day the Exalted One was seated surrounded by the Order of brethren. Then the Exalted One, scanning the Order of brethren, who were keeping perfect silence,' addressed them thus: </P>
<P>Brethren, this assembly is without idle words and free from idle talk. Brethren, this assembly is pure and established in the Reality. Such an Order of brethren, such an assembly as this is hard to find in the world. Such an Order of brethren, such an assembly as this is worthy of offerings, hospitality, gifts, respectful salutation as unto the supreme field of merit to the world. To such an Order of brethren, to such an assembly as this even a little that is given becomes great, and much that is given becomes still greater. Brethren, such an Order of brethren, such an assembly as this is well worth a journey of countless stages,*, even if one had to carry his food in a bag to do it.' Just such an Order of brethren is this.</P>
<P>Brethren, there are some brethren in this Order who dwell having reached deva consciousness. Brethren, there are some brethren in this Order who dwell having reached Brahma consciousness, have won the Imperturbable,* have won the Noble State.</P>
<P>Brethren, who is the brother that has reached deva consciousness? Herein a brother, aloof from sensual delights (and so forth) , having attained to the First Rapture, or the Second or the Third or the Fourth Rapture abides therein.</P>

<P>Brethren, who is the brother that has attained to Brahmaconsciousness?* Herein, a brother dwells diffusing one quarter with thoughts of loving kindness, compassion, sympathy and equanimity; likewise the second quarter, likewise the third quarter, likewise the fourth quarter. So above, below, around, everywhere, and in all respects thus diffusing the whole world, and with a heart full of loving-kindness (and so forth) , developed, grown great, measureless, benevolent and kindly, so he dwells.</P>
