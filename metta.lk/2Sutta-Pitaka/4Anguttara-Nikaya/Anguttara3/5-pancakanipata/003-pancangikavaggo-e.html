<P>Iron, metals, tin, lead and silver. Bhikkhus, these five are the defilements of raw gold, defiled by which the raw gold is not soft, workable, does not shine, is brittle and is not ready to work with. When raw gold is released from these defilements, it becomes soft, workable, it shines, is not brittle and becomes ready to work with. Then the gold becomes suitable to make whatever desired ornament, a ring for the finger, earings, a neck lace or a gold chain.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner these five are the minor defilements of the mind, defiled by which the mind is not soft, not workable, does not shine, is brittle and does not concentrate in one point for the rightful destruction of desires. What five?</P>
<P>Interest for sensuality, anger, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubts. Bhikkhus, these are the five minor defilements of the mind, defiled by which the mind is neither soft nor workable, does not shine and is brittle and does not concentrate for the rightful destruction of desires. Bhikkhus, when the mind is released from these minor defilements, it becomes soft, workable, it shines, is not brittle and comes to one point for the rightful destruction of desires. For the realization of whatever things the mind is directed, the mindfulness in that sphere, becomes the eye witness .</P>

Dives into earth as though diving in water. Walks on water unbroken as though walking on earth. Sits in space as birds large and small do. Touches the moon and sun, as powerful as they are. Thus wields power as far as the world of Brahma. Thus mindfulness becomes the eye witness in that and that sphere.</P>
<P>If it's his desire, with the purified heavenly ear beyond human he hears sounds both heavenly and human, far or near and mindfulness in that and other sphere becomes the eyewitness in the respective sphere.</P>
<P>If it's his desire he penetrating sees the minds of others and knows the mind with greed, without greed, the angry mind and the not angry mind, the deluded mind and the not deluded mind.

<P>If it's his desire, he recollects manifold previous births- such as one birth, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, innumerable forward world cycles, innumerable backward world cycles, innumerable forward and backward world cycles of births - There I was of such name, clan, disposition, such supports, feeling such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and enjoying such a life span.

Thus he sees beings disappearing and appearing in states unexalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly in good and evil births, knows beings born according to their actions and the mindfulness in that and other sphere becomes the eye witness in the respective sphere.</P>

<P>Bhikkhus, what is the five factored right concentration of the noble ones? Here, the bhikkhu secluded from sensual desires ... re ... abides in the first higher state of mind. Then he over flows and touches this body with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion, up and above and from all sides and around not leaving any spot of the body untouched. Like a clever bather or his apprentice, putting some bathing powder in a bronze bowl and sprinkling water on it would mix it, until it is a smooth ball of moist, oily foam not dripping anything.

Then he over flows and touches this body with pleasantness free of joy, up and above and from all sides and around not leaving any spot of the body untouched with pleasantness free of joy. Like some of the blue lotuses, white lotuses or red lotuses in a pond are born, grow and bloom in the water and their tops and roots are touched with the cold water and leaves nothing untouched by the cold water.

<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness ... re ... abides in the fourth higher state of mind. Then he sits touching this body with the pure and clean mind, not leaving any spot of the body untouched with the pure and clean mind. Like a man sitting with his head and body covered with a white piece of cloth. There is not a single spot in his body that is not touched with the white cloth.

<P>Bhikkhus, it is like a chariot with horses yoked on level ground with reins and whip ready at hand.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>003.10. I heard thus. At one time the Blessed One was touring the country of Kosala with a large Community of bhikkhus and entered the Brahmin hamlet Icchanagala and lived in the forest stretch of Icchanagala. The Brahmin householders of Icchanagtala heard that the good recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyas gone forth from the Sakya clan has come to Icchanagala and lives in the forest stretch there. The good name, spread about that good Gotama- That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and Blessed. He teaches to this world together with its gods, M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the community of recluses and Brahmins, the Teaching he had known and realized, good at the beginning, in the middle and the end, purely and completely explaining the holy life. It is good to see such worthy ones. Then the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala at the end of that night carrying a lot of eatables and nourishments approached the forest stretch of Icchangala, and they stood outside the entrance making a lot of noise.</P>
<P>At that time venerable Nagita attended on the Blessed One and the Blessed One addressed venerable Nagita: Nagita, who makes such great noise, like hauling a catch of fish. Venerable sir, they are the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala standing outside, come with a lot of eatables and nourishments for the Blessed One and the Community of bhikkhus Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, the enjoyment of gain, honour and fame&yacute;ay it not come to me. It is vile and sluggish pleasure in comparison to this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, may the Blessed One tolerate. Well Gone One, it is the right time to give consent. Wherever the Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or state, the Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. Like huge drops of rain that fall would turn towards the inclines. In the same manner, wherever the Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or state, the Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. What is the reason? It is on account of the virtues and wisdom of the Blessed One.</P>
<P>Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, the enjoyment of gain, honour and fame&yacute;ay it not come to me. It is vile and sluggish pleasure in comparison to this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly. The enjoyment of gain, honour and fame is a vile and sluggish pleasure. Nagita, what is tasted, drunk, eaten and enjoyed is urine and excreta. It trickles and flows from what is tasted, drunk, eaten and enjoyed. Nagita, to dear ones change into another form occurs and grief, lament, unpleasantness displeasure and distress arises, those are the tricklings from them. Nagita, to one attending to the sign of impurity, on account of a pleasant sign loathsomeness arises, those are the tricklings from them. Nagita, to one abiding with the sign of impermanence in the six spheres of contact, with a contact loathsomeness gets established, those are the tricklings from them. Nagita, to one abiding seeing the arising and falling of the five holding masses, in a holding loathsomeness gets established, those are the tricklings from them.</P>
