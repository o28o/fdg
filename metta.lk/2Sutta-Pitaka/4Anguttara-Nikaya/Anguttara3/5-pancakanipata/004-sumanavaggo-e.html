</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>004.01. At one time the Blessed One was living in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. Princess Sumana attended by five hundred princesses approached the Blessed One in five hundred chariots, worshipped the Blessed One, sat on a side and princess Sumana said to the Blessed One: Venerable sir, there are two disciples with faith, virtues and wisdom on the same level, one is a benefactor and the other is not, after death both go to increase and are born in heaven. Is there a difference in those heavenly beings?</P>
<P>The Blessed One said: Sumana, there is a difference. The heavenly being who was a benefactor excels the heavenly being who was not a benefactor in five factors. In heavenly life span, heavenly beauty, heavenly pleasantness, heavenly fame and heavenly authority. The benefactor excels the other in these five factors.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, if they disappear from there and return here as humans is there a difference in those human beings?</P>
<P>The Blessed One said: Sumana, there is a difference. The human being who was a benefactor excels the human being who was not a benefactor in five factors. In human life span, human beauty, human pleasantness, human fame and human authority. The benefactor excels the other in these five factors.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, if they both leave their households and become homeless, to them gone forth is there a difference in their holy lives?</P>
<P>The Blessed One said: Sumana, there is a difference. The one gone forth, who was a benefactor excels the one who was not a benefactor in five factors. Entreated he partakes many robes and few without, entreated he partakes much morsel food and less without entreated he partakes many dwellings and a few without and entreated he partakes much requisites when ill and a few without. Whilst living with the co-associates in the holy life most of their bodily, verbal and mental activities are done pleasantly and a few unpleasantly. Most of the suggestions are done pleasantly and a few unpleasantly. The benefactor excels the other in these five factors.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, if they both become noble is there a difference in those ones who have become noble?</P>
<P>The Blessed One said: Sumana, there is no difference in the release and their release.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, it is wonderful and surprising, indeed gifts should be given and merit should be done, merit is useful for heavenly beings, human beings and even when gone forth.</P>
<P>Sumana, it is so! Certainly, gifts should be given and merit should be done! It becomes useful for heavenly beings, human beings and even to those gone forth.</P>
<P>The Blessed One further said: </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>When the moon rises in the sky, all the host of stars grow in splendour<BR>
Likewise the virtuous, man with faith, excels in liberality among the miserly<BR>
The rainy clouds fill the valleys and highlands bringing much wealth,<BR>
In the same manner the wise disciple of the rightfully Enlightened One<BR>
Excels among the miserly in life span, fame, beauty and pleasantness.<BR>
Surrounded by wealth now. Later he rejoices in heaven.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>004.02 At one time the Blessed One was living in the squirrels' sanctuary in Rajagaha. Princess Cundi attended by five hundred princesses approached the Blessed One in five hundred chariots, worshipped the Blessed One, sat on a side and princess Cundi said to the Blessed One: </P>
<P>Venerable sir, my brother prince Cunda says: Whether it's a woman or man if he takes refuge in the Blessed One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus, abstains from destroying living things, taking the not given, misbehaviour in sexual conduct, telling lies, and taking intoxicated and brewed drinks, after death he is born in heaven and does not go to loss. I ask the Blessed One: Venerable sir, placing what kind of faith in the Teacher, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus, would someone after death be born in heaven and not in loss?</P>
<P>Cundi, of all beings without feet, two feet, four feet or many feet, material or immaterial, perceptive or not, neither perceptive nor non- perceptive, of them the Thus Gone One, worthy and rightfully enlightened is the foremost. Placing faith in the Enlightened One is placing faith in the highest and it brings the highest results.</P>
<P>Cundi, of all things compounded or not compounded, dispassionateness is the foremost. Such as freedom from pride and conceit, allaying thirsts, destroying settling places, breaking up the rounds of rebirth, destruction of craving, disenchantment, cessation and extinction. Cundi, they that have faith in dispassionateness, have placed faith in the highest for highest results</P>
<P>Cundi, of all communities or gatherings the disciples of the Thus Gone One are foremost, such as the four doublets of eight Great Men, who are reverential, worthy of hospitality, gifts and veneration with clasped hands, the field of merit for the world. Cundi, they that have faith in the Community of bhikkhus, have placed faith in the highest for highest results</P>
<P>Cundi, of virtues, the virtues desired by the noble ones is foremost. Such as the virtues that are unbroken, not fissured, without spots, are pure, consistent, free of slavery, praised by the wise as unaffected and conducive to concentration. Cundi, completeness of the virtues desired by the noble ones is the highest completeness, for that highest completeness there are highest results.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Faith should be placed in the highest, knowing the highest Teaching<BR>
Faith in the Enlightened One worthy of incomparable offerings,<BR>
Faith in the pleasure of disenchantment of things<BR>
Faith in the Community of bhikkhus, the incomparable field of merit<BR>
Making offerings to them the highest merit is accrued<BR>
Of the most excellent of life span, beauty, fame, pleasantness and power<BR>
The wise give to the highest, settled in the highest teaching.<BR>
And gaining the highest as god or man enjoy that bliss.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>004.03. At one time the Blessed One lived in Bhaddiya in the dense forest. Then Uggaha the grand son of Mendaka approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said: Venerable sir, may the Blessed One accept tomorrow's meal from me with three others. The Blessed One accepted in silence. Then Uggaha the grand son of Mendaka knowing that the Blessed One had accepted got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated the Blessed One and went away.</P>
<P>The Blessed One at the end of that night, putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes approached the home of Uggaha the grandson of Mendaka and sat on the prepared seats. Then Uggaha the grandson of Mendaka served with his own hands the Blessed One with nourishing eatables and drinks. Knowing that the Blessed One had finished taking the meal and had put away the bowl, he sat on a side and said to the Blessed One: Venerable sir, these girls will be going to their husbands clans. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One advise them for their welfare for a long time.</P>
<P>The Blessed One said to those girls: Therefore, girls, you should train thus. Our mother and father shows our husbands out of compassion for our welfare. We will rise when they approach, will go to sleep after them, will do their duties obediently. We will do their wishes, will talk to them pleasantly</P>
<P>Therfore, girls, you should train thus: We will honour and revere the elders in the husbands' homes, whether mother or father, recluses or Brahmins. At their arrival we will offer them seats and water</P>
<P>Therefore girls, you should train thus: Whatever activities there be in the husband's home if it is to comb silk thread, we will be clever and not lazy and become efficient to do them ourselves and to get it done by others.</P>
<P>Therefore girls, you should train thus: We should know the people in our husband's home, whether servants, messengers or workmen. We should know what they should do, and what they should not do. We should know the sick, the fit and the physically unfit, eatables and nourishments we will divide up to the last.</P>
<P>Therefore girls, you should train thus: Whatever our husbands bring, wealth, grains, silver or gold, we will protect them, and we should do it without anger, without a thievish mind, without an addiction to it and with a protective mentality. Girls, a woman endowed with these five things after death are born in the company of the gods of pleasantness</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Do not belittle your husband, who supports you actively and zealously,<BR>
Do not disturb the master's mind and make him angry with selfish thoughts<BR>
The wise should honour the master and all the elders in the clan<BR>
With aroused effort zealously attend on the lower staff too,<BR>
Do the wishes of the master and protect all<BR>
The woman who sees to the interests of the husband thus,<BR>
Is born with the gods of happiness.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>004.04. At one time the Blessed One was living in the gabled house in the Great Forest in Vesali. Then General Siha approached the Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said: Venerable sir, could the Blessed One point out the results of benevolence here and now?</P>
<P>Siha, it is possible. The benevolent one is pleasant and pleasing to the populace, this is a result evident to him here and now.</P>
<P>Again, Siha the benevolent one, associates appeased Great Men, this is a result evident to him here and now.</P>
<P>Again, Siha the benevolent one is praised, this is a result evident to him here and now.</P>
<P>Again, Siha the benevolent one approaching whatever gathering whether of warriors, Brahmins or householders, he approaches them undisturbed with self confidence, this is a result evident to him here and now.</P>
<P>Again, Siha the benevolent one is born in heaven after death, this is a result to him here after.</P>
<P>Then the general Siha said to the Blessed One, until these four results of benevolence that are here and now are explained I did not gain such faith in the Blessed One, am aware of the results of benevolence here after. Venerable sir, am a benefactor pleasing to the populace, I associate appeased Great Men, fame has spread about me, to say that am a benefactor and that I attend on the Community. Whatever gathering it may be, whether warriors, Brahmins or householders, I approach with self confidence, unconfused. Venerable sir, until the Blessed One told that the benefactor is born in a good state, in heaven after death, I was not aware of it. I take faith in the Blessed One on account of that too.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Siha, it is so! the benefactor is born in a good state, in heaven after death.<BR>
Many associate the pleasing benefactor and his wealth and fame increase.<BR>
The not selfish man approaches gatherings unconfused, with self-confidence.<BR>
Therefore the wise dispel the stains of selfishness and give gifts desiring pleasantness.<BR>
Making merit and disappearing from here, they delight in the company of gods,<BR>
Endowed with the five strands of sensuality, they delight in heaven.<BR>
The disciples of the Well Gone One delight in heaven not clinging.</P></DIR>
