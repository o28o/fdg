<P>Bhikkhus, these five are obstacles, over growths the things that weaken wisdom. What five?</P>
<P>Sensual desires, anger, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubts are obstacles, mental over growths, the things that weaken wisdom.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, that the bhikkhu should know his own good, the good of others or the good of both or will know and realize something noble above human without dispelling without making weak wisely considering the danger, of the obstacles sensual desires, anger, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubts is not a possibility. Like a man opening the forrowed mouths of the ploughed field to a river with a long course from the top of the mountain, moving swiftly, with a weight. Then bhikkhus, in the middle, the stream gets scattered and disturbed and does not go far, move fast or take much weight. In the same manner the bhikkhu should know his own good, the good of others or the good of both or will know and realize something noble above human without dispelling without making weak without wisely considering the danger, of the obstacles sensual desires, anger, sloth and torpor, restlessness and worry and doubts is not a possibility.</P>

<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu has faith, in the enlightenment of the Thus Gone One. The Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of worlds, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed.

Abides with aroused effort to dispel demerit and for the accumulation of merit, firm in the endeavour, not giving up the main aim.

<P>Again, bhikkhus there is a time of fear from invading forest tribes on wheels. This is the fourth time not suitable to make effort.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the Community of bhikkhus break up. When the Community of bhikkhus break up, they blame each other, debase each other and get enclosed in small sections and reject certain sections. The displeased do not become pleased, some of those pleased go away. This is the fifth time not suitable to make effort.</P>

At that time both mother and son a bhikkhu and bhikkhuni had observed the rains in S&agrave;vatthi. They constantly desired each others sight. The mother desired to see the son and the son desired to see the mother. The two seeing each other constantly, a relationship began and with the relationship confidence got established and they approached each other Fallen in love for each other without giving up robes, they secretly had sexual intercourse.</P>
<P>Then many bhikkhus approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side and those bhikkhus said to The Blessed One: Here venerable sir, a mother and son a bhikkhu and bhikkhuni had observed the rains in S&agrave;vatthi. They constantly desired each others sight. The mother desired to see the son and the son desired to see the mother. The two seeing each other constantly, a relationship began and with the relationship confidence got established and they approached each other Fallen in love for each other without giving up robes, they secretly had sexual intercourse.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, does the foolish man think the mother would not crave for the son or the son for the mother? Bhikkhus, I do not know of any other form so enticing, desirable, intoxicating, binding and causing infatuation and so dangerous for the noble ending of unpleasantness as the form of the woman. Bhikkhus, sentient beings, attached, swooned, bound, infatuated and clinging to the form of the woman come to grief for a long time become subjective Bhikkhus, I do not know of any other sound, ... re ... any other smell, ... re ... any other taste, ... re ... any other touch so enticing, desirable, intoxicating, binding and causing infatuation and so dangerous for the noble ending of unpleasantness as the touch of the woman. Bhikkhus, sentient beings, attached, swooned, bound, infatuated and clinging to the touch of the woman come to grief for a long time having become subjective.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, when the woman is going, she takes hold of the man's mind, when standing, ... re ... when sitting, ... re ... when lying, ... re ... when laughing, ... re ... when talking, ... re ... when singing, ... re ... when crying, ... re ... when struck, ... re ... and even when dead she takes hold of the man's mind. Bhikkhus, saying it correctly, the woman is an all round snare of Death. Bhikkhus, I do not know of any other form so enticing, desirable, intoxicating, binding and causing infatuation and so dangerous for the noble ending of unpleasantness as the form of the woman. Bhikkhus, sentient beings, attached, swooned, bound, infatuated and clinging to the form of the woman come to grief for a long time become subjective Bhikkhus, I do not know of any other form so enticing, desirable, intoxicating, binding and causing infatuation and so dangerous for the noble ending of unpleasantness as the form of the woman.

<DIR>

<P>The woman talks to one with sword in hand and even to a sprite,<BR>
Gets mixed up even with snake poison, which if stings would die.<BR>
A woman does not speak with only one,<BR>
Gets hold of the confused with a glance and smile,<BR>
Or showing the body or with charming words<BR>
Even the very pure are struck and fall<BR>
The five strands of sense pleasures are seen in the woman,<BR>
As forms, sounds, tastes, smells and touches,<BR>
And someone is unknowingly carried away by the floods of sensuality<BR>
To go on in existences, in time, in births being and not being<BR>
Those who thoroughly know sensuality abide without fear,<BR>
They have gone beyond this world, destroying desires.</P></DIR>

The Teaching does not occur to me. My mind is overcome by sloth and torpor. I lead the holy life discontented and I have doubts about the Teaching.</P>
<P>Then that bhikkhu took his associate bhikkhu to The Blessed One, worshipped sat on a side and said to The Blessed One: Venerable sir, this bhikkhu says: Venerable sir, now my body is out of control, the directions are not clearly visible to me. The Teaching does not occur to me. My mind is overcome by sloth and torpor. I lead the holy life discontented and I have doubts about the Teaching.</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, it is so. To one with uncontrolled mental faculties, to one who does not know the right amount to eat, not yoked to wakefulness, not insightful of meritorious things and to one who abides not yoked to development of mind in the enlightenment factors in the late and early hours of the night, it so happens. His body goes out of control, directions do not become clearly visible to him. The Teaching does not occur to him and his mind overcome with sloth and torpor, he leads the holy life discontented and he has doubts. Therefore, bhikkhu you should train thus: I will control my mental faculties. I will know the right amount to eat. I will yoke myself to wakefulness, will be insightful of meritorious things and I will abide yoked to development of mind in the enlightenment factors in the late and early hours of the night.</P>
<P>That bhikkhu thus advised by The Blessed One, got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One and went away. Then that bhikkhu secluded and withdrawing from the crowd abode diligently to dispel. Before long he here and now by himself knew and realized the noble end of the holy life for which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless. He thoroughly knew birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. That bhikkhu became one of the arahants.</P>
<P>Then that bhikkhu, an arahant approached his preceptor and said: Venerable sir, now my body is not out of control, the directions are clearly visible to me. The Teaching occurs to me. My mind is not overcome by sloth and torpor. I lead the holy life contented and I have no doubts about the Teaching.</P>

<P>Bhikkhu, it is so. To one with controlled mental faculties, to one who knows the right amount to eat, to one yoked to wakefulness, is insightful of meritorious things and to one who abides yoked to development of mind in the enlightenment factors in the late and early hours of the night, it so happens. His body does not go out of control, directions become clearly visible to him. The Teaching occurs to him and his mind not overcome with sloth and torpor, he leads the holy life contented and he has no doubts. Therefore, bhikkhus you should train thus: We will control our mental faculties. We will know the right amount to eat.
