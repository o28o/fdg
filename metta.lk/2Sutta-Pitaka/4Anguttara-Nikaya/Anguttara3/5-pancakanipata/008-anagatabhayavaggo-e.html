What is the top of the banner there? The bhikkhu does not hear, in such a village or hamlet there is a woman or a girl endowed with the highest beauty. But he himself sees a woman or girl with the highest beauty. Seeing her he sinks and dejected is unable to bear the holy life and manifesting a weakness to keep the precepts he comes to the lower life This is the top of the banner.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like the soldier who does not sink seing a heap of dust but sinks seeing the top of the banner and dejected cannot keep firm and go to the battle field. Bhikkhus, I say this person is comparable to him. This person evident among bhikkhus, is comparable to the second soldier.</P>

<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu does not sink seeing a heap of dust or the top of the banner or hearing the tumult and is not killed. He goes to the battle, wins the battle and abides in the battle field. What is his winning the battle?</P>
<P>Here a woman approaches the bhikkhu gone to the forest, to the root of a tree or to an empty house and sits by him, encroaches him and submerges him. He encroached and submerged by her disentangles himself and releases himself and goes wherever he desires. Abides in a solitary dwelling, a forest, the root of a tree, a mountain grotto, a mountain cave, a cemetery, a jungle forest, some open space or a heap of straw.</P>
<P>Gone to the forest, root of a tree or to an empty house, sits cross legged, placing his body straight and mindfulness established in front of him. He dispels covetousness for the world purifies the mind of covetousness and abides with a non coveting mind. Dispelling anger abides with a non-angry mind. He purifies the mind with compassion for all the world. Dispelling sloth and torpor abides with a mind free of sloth and torpor, abides mindful and aware of the perception of light. Dispelling restless and worry abides undisturbed and internally appeased. Dispelling doubts abides without doubts about meritorious things that should be done and not done.</P>
<P>Dispelling these five obstructions of the mind and wisely making the minor defilements of the mind weak, he secludes the mind from sensual desires ... re ... with equanimity to joy and disenchantment abides mindful and aware and experiences pleasantness with the body too and attains to the third higher state of the mind. To this the noble ones say `abiding in pleasantness with equanimity. ' Dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier having overcome pleasure and displeasure, purifying the mind with equanimity so that there is not unpleasantness or pleasantness and abides in the fourth higher state of mind.</P>
<P>When the mind is concentrated, pure, without blemish and when the minor defilelments are removed, when the mind is workable and pliable and made immovable, he directs the mind for the destruction of desires. He knows as it really is, this is unpleasant, this its arising, this its cessation and this is the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness. He knows, as it really is, these are desires, this is the arising of desires, this is the cessation of desires and he knows as it really is this is the path leading to the cessation of desires. When he knows and sees in this manner, his mind finds release from sensual desires, from desires `to be' and finds release from ignorant desires. When released knowledge arises birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. This is his victory at the battle.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like the soldier neither sinking seeing a heap of dust, the top of the banner, the tumult or even the impact, has won the battle and abides in the battle field. Bhikkhus, such a person is evident. This person evident in the world is comparable to the fifth soldier.</P>

When I have attained it and realized it, even if decayed, I will have a pleasant abiding Bhikkhus, seeing this first future fear the bhikkhu should certainly abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects, now I'm with few ailments, healthy, with a balanced digestive system, not too cold, nor too hot. There will be a time when this body will ail, overcome by ailments, it is difficult to think of the dispensation of the enlightened ones. It is not easy to dwell in jungle forests when ailing. Before that undesirable, disagreeable thing comes, I should quickly arouse effort for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized. When I have attained it and realized it, even if I had ailments, I will have a pleasant abiding Bhikkhus, seeing this second future fear the bhikkhu should certainly abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects, now there is no shortage of food, there is plenty of grains, and morsel food is not rare, there are no doubts about scraps. There will be a time of famine, with little grains and morsel food rare there would not be scraps. In times of famine people move to areas where there is food. When they move, there is crowding. Living in a crowded surrounding, it is difficult to think of the dispensation of the enlightened ones. It is not easy to dwell in jungle forests either. Before that undesirable, disagreeable thing comes, I should quickly arouse effort for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized. When I have attained it and realized it, even if there be a famine, I will have a pleasant abiding Bhikkhus, seeing this third future fear the bhikkhu should certainly abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects, now people live united without a dispute, mixing like milk and water, looking at each other with pleasant eyes There will be a time of disturbance when pleople from the states go about mounting chariots. When there is such fear, people migrate to places where there is peace. When they move, there is crowding. Living in a crowded surrounding, it is difficult to think of the dispensation of the enlightened ones. It is not easy to dwell in jungle forests either. Before that undesirable, disagreeable thing comes, I should quickly arouse effort for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized. When I have attained it and realized it, even when there is fear, I will have a pleasant abiding Bhikkhus, seeing this fourth future fear the bhikkhu should certainly abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu reflects, now the Community of bhikkhus are united, without a dispute, abiding pleasantly, reciting a single set of rules. There will be a time when the Community splits. When the Community of bhikkhus split, it is difficult to think of the dispensation of the enlightened ones. It is not easy to dwell in jungle forests either. Before that undesirable, disagreeable thing comes, I should quickly arouse effort for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized. When I have attained it and realized it, even if the Community splits, I will have a pleasant abiding Bhikkhus, seeing this fifth future fear the bhikkhu should certainly abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, seeing these five future fears the bhikkhu should certainly abide diligent to dispel, for the attainment of the not yet attained and the realization of the not yet realized.</P>

<P>Bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, bodily undeveloped, in virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped. They will give the higher ordination to others, but would not be able to discipline them in higher virtues, mind, and wisdom. Then those bhikkhus too would be bodily undeveloped, in virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped They too will give the higher ordination to others, but would not be able to discipline them in higher virtues, mind, and wisdom. Then those bhikkhus too would be bodily undeveloped, in virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped. Thus bhikkhus, it is pollution in the Teaching and as a result pollution in the Discipline, when there is pollution in the Disccipline, there is pollution in the Teaching. Bhikkhus, this is the first future fear, not yet arisen, it will arise in the future. You should be wakeful to them and make effort to dispel them.</P>

<P>Again,bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, bodily undeveloped, in virtues undeveloped, mentally undeveloped and in wisdom undeveloped. They would not listen to the discourses with deep meanings dealing about the void and beyond this world, would not arouse effort to realize them. Would not think to learn them or practise them. They would listen to discourses in verse form, in decorative language and decorative words. They will think to understand such teachings of other disciples. Thus bhikkhus, it is pollution in the Teaching and as a result pollution in the Discipline, when there is pollution in the Disccipline, there is pollution in the Teaching.

<P>Bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, desiring good robes and as a result they would give up looking out for robes cloth in a heap of dirt or outside a shop.

<P>Again, bhikkhus, in the future there will be bhikkhus, living together with novice bhikkhunis. When this is so, the holy life will be led with disinterest or would come to some defilement. Or would decrease from the holy life and come to lay life. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth future fear, not yet arisen, it will arise in the future.
