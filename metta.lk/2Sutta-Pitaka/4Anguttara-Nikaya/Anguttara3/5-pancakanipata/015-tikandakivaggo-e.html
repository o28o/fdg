The Blessed One putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes entered Vesali for alms. At that time about five hundred Licchavis were assembled and seated at the Sarandada monument and this talk arose among them: The arising of five jewels are rare in the world. What five?</P>
<P>The jewel of an elephant, the jewel of a horse, the jewel of a jewel, the jewel of a woman and the jewel of a householder. The arising of these five jewels are rare in the world.</P>
<P>Then they placed a man on the path and told him: Good man, if you see The Blessed One, inform us. That man saw The Blessed One coming in the distance and approached the Licchavis and said: Sirs, that Blessed One, worthy and rightfully enlightened is coming, and it is time to do the fitting.</P>
<P>The Licchavis approached The Blessed One, worshipped, and standing on a side said to The Blessed One: </P>
<P>Venerable sir, it is good if you approach the Sarandada monument out of compassion. The Blessed One consented in silence and approached the Sarandada monument and sat on the prepared seat and asked: Liccahvis with what talk were you seated here and what was the other conversation? Venerable sir, we were assembled and seated here and this talk arose among us: The arising of five jewels are rare in the world. What five?</P>
<P>The jewel of an elephant, the jewel of a horse, the jewel of a jewel, the jewel of a woman and the jewel of a householder. The arising of these five jewels are rare in the world.</P>
