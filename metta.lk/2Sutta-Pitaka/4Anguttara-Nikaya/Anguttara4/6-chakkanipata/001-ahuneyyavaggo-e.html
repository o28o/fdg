<P>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu endowed with these six things is worshipful, suitable for hospitality, gifts and to honour with clasped hands the incomparable field of merit for the world. What six?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu seeing a form is neither pleased or displeased abides mindful and aware with equanimity. Hearing a sound, ... re ... scenting a smell, ... re ... tasting a taste, ... re ... cognizing a touch with the body, ... re ... and cognizing an idea, is neither pleased nor displeased, abides mindful and aware with equanimity.</P>

<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu partakes various psyshic powers. One becomes many and many becomes one. Evidently goes across walls, embankments, rocks without obstructions as though going in space. Dives in and comes out of earth as though in water. Goes unbroken on water as though on earth. Sits in a cross legged position, in space as birds large and small do. He touches the moon and sun, as powerful as they are and wields power with the body as far as the world of Brahma.</P>
<P>With the purified ear element beyond human, hears sounds both human and heavenly, far and near. Penetrating the minds of other beings, other persons he knows and sees the mind with greed, without greed, with anger and without anger, with delusion, and without delusion, the contracted mind and the distracted mind, the mind that has grown great and the mind that has not grown great, the mind with a compare, and the mind without a compare, the concentrated mind and the unconcentrated mind, the released mind and the not released mind.</P>
<P>He recollects manifold previous births such as one birth, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, an innumerable forward cycle of births, an innumerable backward cycle of births and an innumerable forward and backward cycle of births. There I was of such name, clan, disposition, supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and such a life span. Disappearing from there I was born here. Thus with all details the manifold previous births are recollected.</P>
<P>With the purified heavenly eye beyond human sees beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, in good and evil states, knows how beings are born according to their actions. These good beings endowed with bodily, verbal and mental misbehaviour, rebuking noble ones, with wrong view and with the wrong view of actions, after death are born in loss, in a bad state in hell. As for these good beings endowed with bodily, verbal and mental good behaviour, not rebuking noble ones, with right view and the right view of actions, after death are born in increase, in a good state in heaven.</P>
<P>With the purified heavenly eye beyond human sees beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, in good and evil states, knows how beings are born according to their actions. Destroying desires, releasing the mind from desires and released through wisdom, here and now abides having known and realized.</P>
