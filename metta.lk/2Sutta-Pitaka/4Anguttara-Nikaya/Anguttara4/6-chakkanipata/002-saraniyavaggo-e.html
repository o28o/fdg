<P>Notes. [1]. Bodily thoughts of loving kindness. `metta&uuml; k&agrave;yakamma&uuml;' In the body are the six doors of mental contact. It is through them that all activity start, such as through seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touch and the mind. [2] When thoughts arise on account of these activities they should be with loving kindness `metta&uuml; vacikamma&uuml;' Thoughts are words. [3] On account of this procedure, there are feelings and perceptions which are related to `metta&uuml; manokamma&uuml;' And those feelings and perceptions should be with loving kindness. Feelings and perceptions are connected with the mind.</P>

Then that bhikkhu should abide in joy and delight, engaged day and night in those same meritorious things.</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, when the day is over and the night is falling, the bhikkhu reflects, my death may come about owing to many reasons, a serpent might sting me, a scorpion might sting me or a centepede might sting me, if I die on account of it, it would be dangerous for me; or I might slip and fall, or the food I eat would disagree, or my bile or phglem would get disordered, or a cutting pain would hurt me by that I would meet death and that would be dangerous to me. Then that bhikhu should reflect thus: Are there any evil things not dispelled in me, which would be a danger if I die this day? When the bhikkhu reflects if he knows, there are evil demerit not dispelled in me, which would be a danger if I die this day. Then that bhikkhu should arouse a lot of interest, effort, strength and unhindered exertion and mindful awareness to dispel them. Bhikkhus, like one with head or clothes on fire would arouse a lot of interest, effort, strength and unhindred exertion and mindful awareness to put out that fire. If the bhikkhu reflecting knows, I have no evil demerit in me, even if I die this day, there would be no danger. Then that bhikkhu should abide in joy and delight engaged day and night in those same meritorious things.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, mindfulness of death developed and made much in this manner is very beneficial and ends in deathlessness.</P></FONT></BODY>
