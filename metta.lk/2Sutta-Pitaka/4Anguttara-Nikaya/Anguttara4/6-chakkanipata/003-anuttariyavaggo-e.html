Then a certain deity, when the night was waning illuminating the whole of the pond with a resplendent light approached The Blessed One, worshipped, stood on a side and said to The Blessed One: Venerable sir, these three things conduce to the decrease of the bhikkhu. What three?</P>
<P>Becoming fond of activity, becoming fond of talk and becoming fond of sleep. Venerable sir, these three things conduce to the decrease of the bhikkhu. Saying it stood, waiting for the approval. Knowing that The Blessed One has approved, worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One and vanished.</P>
<P>The Blessed One at the end of that night addressed the bhikkhus: </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, last night a certain deity, when the night was waning illuminating the whole of the pond with a resplendent light approached me, worshipped, stood on a side and said to me: Venerable sir, these three things conduce to the decrease of the bhikkhu. What three?</P>
<P>Becoming fond of activity, becoming fond of talk and becoming fond of sleep. Venerable sir, these three things conduce to the decrease of the bhikkhu. Saying it she stood, waiting for my approval. Knowing that I approved, she worshipped and circumambulated me and vanished.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is no gain for you, it is rare, even the gods know these decreasing things. Bhikkhus, I will give three other decreasing things listen carefully and attend. What are the three things?</P>
<P>Fondness of company, unruliness and evil friendship. Bhikkhus, these three are decreasing things.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, if any bhikkhus decreased in meritorious things, in the past, they did so on account of these six things. If any bhikkhus, decrease in meritorious things in the future, they will do so, on account of these six things. If any bhikkhus, decrease in meritorious things at present, they do so on account of these six things.</P>

<P>Bhikkhus, why is fear a synonym for sensuality?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, someone burning with sensual greed, bound with interest and greed, is not free from fear here and now, nor is he free from fear here after. Therefore fear is a synonym for sensuality.</P>

<P>Fear, unpleasantness, sickness, knot, clinging and mud,<BR>
These are called sensuality, in which the ordinary folk cling.<BR>
They that are appeased see fear in birth, death and being<BR>

<P>Again, venerable sir, the bhikkhu reflects a body thrown in the charnel ground, when dead, after one day, or two days, or three days, or swollen, or turned blue, or festering and reflects, it will be the same with this body too. This body has not gone beyond that. Or he looks at a body thrown in the charnel ground eaten by, crows, hawks, vultures, dogs, foxes, or eaten by various living things and reflects it will be the same with this body too. This body has not gone beyond that. Or he looks at a body thrown in the charnel ground, a skeleton with flesh, smeared with blood and bound with veins, a skeleton without flesh smeared with blood and bound with veins, a skeleton without flesh not smeared with blood and bound with veins, a skeleton with disconnected bones, thrown here and there, the bones of the hand in one place, of the feet in another place, of the knee in another place, of the thigh in one place, of the hips in another place, the backbone in one place and scull in another place and reflects it will be the same with this body too.
