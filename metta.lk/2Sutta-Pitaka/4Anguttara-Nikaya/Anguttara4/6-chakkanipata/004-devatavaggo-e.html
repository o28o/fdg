</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>004.04. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. At that time to venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na this thought arose, when he was in seclusion: `To which gods does the knowledge arise, I have entered the stream of the Teaching, I do not fall from it. I am directly intent on extinction.? At that time a bhikkhu named Tissa who had passed away recently had appeared in a certain Brahma world. That Brahma Tissa is very powerful, he should know it.</P>
<P>Then venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na disappeared from Jeta's grove and appeared in the world of Brahma as a strong man would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm. Brahma Tissa saw venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na approaching in the distance and said: Welcome! Sir, Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na, it's after a long time that venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na found a chance to come here. Sir, Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na take a seat. Venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na sat on the prepared seat and Brahma Tissa worshipped venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na and sat on a side. Venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na said: Tissa, to which gods does the knowledge arise, `I have entered the stream of the Teaching, I do not fall from it. I am directly intent on extinction'? Venerable sir, to the four guardian gods such knowledge arises. Tissa, does this knowledge, `I have entered the stream of the Teaching, I do not fall from it. I am directly intent on extinction,' arise to all four guardian gods? Venerable sir, Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na, it does not occur to the four guardian gods, who are not endowed with, unwavering faith in The Blessed One, in the Teaching, in the Community of bhikkhus and virtues desired by the noble ones. Venerable sir, Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na, it occurs to the four guardian gods, who are endowed with, unwavering faith in The Blessed One, in the Teaching, in the Community of bhikkhus and virtues desired by the noble ones. Tissa, is it only to the four guardian gods, that this knowledge arise? `I have entered the stream of the Teaching, I do not fall from it.

Venerable sir, Moggall&agrave;na, it does not occur to all gods attached to the creation of others. Of the gods attached to the creation of others, it occurs to those endowed with, unwavering faith in The Blessed One, in the Teaching, in the Community of bhikkhus and virtues desired by the noble ones.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>004.07. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. At that time Velukandaki Nandamata was offering gifts endowed with six factors to the Community of bhikkhus headed by S&agrave;riputta and Maggallana. The Blessed One with his purified heavenly eye, which is beyond human saw Velukandaki Nandamata offering gifts endowed with six factors to the Community of bhikkhus headed by S&agrave;riputta and Moggall&agrave;na and addressed the bhikkhus.- Here, bhikkhus, Velukandaki Nandamata is offering gifts endowed with six factors to the Community of bhikkhus headed by S&agrave;riputta and Moggall&agrave;na. Bhikkhus, what are gifts endowed with six factors?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, there are three factors to the giver and three factors to the acceptor. Bhikkhus, what are the three fators of the giver? Even before giving the giver has a pleasant mind, while giving the mind is pleased and having given the mind is pleased. These are the three fators of the giver. What are the three factors of the acceptor? Here bhikkhus the acceptor is free of greed, free of anger and free of delusion. Bhikkhus, these are the three factors of the acceptor. Bhikkhus, thus it becomes a gift endowed with six factors.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, it is not easy to account for the merits of a gift endowed with these six factors as, it is a yield of merit, a yield of good, a bringer of pleasantness and heavenly bliss that is conducive to agreeability and pleasantness of such a measure. It becomes a mass of pleasantness that is immeasurable. As the water in the great ocean cannot be measured as it is a hundred vessels full of water, or a thousand vessels full of water or a hundred thousand vessels full of water, yet it becomes a mass of water that is immeasurable. In the same manner bhikkhus, it is not easy to account for the merits of a gift endowed with these six factors as, it is a yield of merit, a yield of good, a bringer of pleasantness and heavenly bliss that is conducive to agreeability and pleasantness of such a measure. It becomes a mass of pleasantness that is immeasurable.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Even before giving the mind is pleased, while giving is pleased,<BR>
Having given is pleased, this is the accomplishment in giving a gift.<BR>
The restrained, leading a holy life, free of greed, hate and delusion<BR>
Are the field for offering gifts.</P>
<P>By oneself cooked and offering with one's own hands<BR>
One's belongings offered to others is of great fruit.<BR>
The wise offering with faith and released mind<BR>
Are reborn in a world of pleasantness without troubles.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>004.12 I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was touring the country of Kosala with a large Community of bhikkhus and entered the Brahmin hamlet Icchanagala and lived in the forest stretch of Icchanagala. The Brahmin householders of Icchanagtala heard that the good recluse Gotama, the son of the Sakyas gone forth from the Sakya clan has come to Icchanagala and lives in the forest stretch there. The good name, spread about that good Gotama- That Blessed One is worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, the incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and Blessed. He teaches to this world together with its gods, M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the community of recluses and Brahmins, the Teaching he had known and realized, good at the beginning, in the middle and the end, purely and completely explaining the holy life. It is good to see such worthy ones. Then the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala at the end of that night carrying a lot of eatables and nourishments approached the forest stretch of Icchangala, and they stood outside the entrance making a lot of noise.</P>
<P>At that time venerable Nagita attended on The Blessed One and The Blessed One addressed venerable Nagita: Nagita, who makes such great noise, like hauling a catch of fish. Venerable sir, they are the Brahmin householders of Icchanagala standing outside, come with a lot of eatables and nourishments for The Blessed One and the Community of bhikkhus Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, the enjoyment of gain, honour and fame&yacute;ay it not come to me. It is vile and sluggish pleasure in comparison to this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, may The Blessed One tolerate. Well Gone One, it is the right time to give consent. Wherever The Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or state, the Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. Like huge drops of rain that fall would turn towards the inclines. In the same manner, wherever The Blessed One inclines now, whether hamlet or state, the Brahmin householders too would bend, to that hamlet or state. What is the reason? It is on account of the virtues and wisdom of The Blessed One.</P>
<P>Nagita, I do not tolerate that eminent fame, the enjoyment of gain, honour and fame&yacute;ay it not come to me. It is vile and sluggish pleasure in comparison to this emancipation from worldliness, the pleasures of seclusion, appeasement, enlightenment, non sensual pleasure gained for nothing and gained quickly. The enjoyment of gain, honour and fame is a vile and sluggish pleasure.</P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the out skirts of the village, seated distracted, then it occurs to me: These venerable ones either offend forest bhikkhus or novices, therefore they fall from their concentration. Nagita, then I am not pleased with their living in the out skirts of the village.</P>
<P>Nagita, I see bhikkhus, living in the forest dozing away seated, then it occurs to me: These venerable ones dispelling their sleepiness should develop the perceptilon of forest, attending to the perception of solidarity Nagita, then I am pleased with their living in the forest.</P>
