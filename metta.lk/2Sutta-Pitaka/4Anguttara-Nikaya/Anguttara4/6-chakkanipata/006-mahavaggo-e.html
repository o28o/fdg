<P ALIGN="CENTER">1. So&otilde;asutta&uuml; &Yacute; Venerabe Sona</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>006.01. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijja peaks in Rajagaha. At that time venerable Sona lived in the cool forest in Rajagaha. This thought and discursive thought arose to venerable Sona in his seclusion. `I am one of the disciples of The Blessed One who abide with aroused effort. Yet my mind is not released from desires without a hold. There is wealth in my family. I could partake that wealth, do merit . What if I give up the holy life and come to the lower life, partake my wealth and do merit.' The Blessed One knowing the discursive thought in venerable Sona's mind, as a strong man would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm, disappeared from the peaks of Gijja and appeared before venerable Sona in the cool forest. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and venerable Sona worshipped The Blessed One and sat on a side. The Blessed One said: Sona, did this discursive thought arise to you in your seclusion `I am one of the disciples of The Blessed One who abide with aroused effort. Yet my mind is not released from desires without a hold. There is wealth in my family. I could partake that wealth, do merit . What if I give up the holy life and come to the lower life, partake my wealth and do merit.'? Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>When you were a householder, were you clever at the violin to arouse music? Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Sona, when the strings of the violin were too tight, was it workable and did it produce the right music? No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Sona, when the strings of the violin were too loose, was it workable and did it produce the right music? No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Sona, when the strings of the violin were not too tight, nor too loose, and adjusted accordingly, was it workable and did it produce the right music? Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>Sona, in the same manner too much aroused effort conduces to distraction, too little aroused effort conduces to laziness. Therefore Sona intend an evenness in arousing effort and an evenness of the mental faculties to penetrate and take up the sign. Venerable Sona accepted that advice and The Blessed One having advised venerable Sona left the cool forest as a strong man would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm and appeared among the peaks of Gijja.</P>
<P>Then venerable Sona intended an evenness in arousing effort and an evenness of the mental faculties to penetrate and took up the sign. Then venerable Sona withdrawing from the crowd and abiding diligent to dispel before long here and now by himself realized and abode, the noble end of the holy life for which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless. He knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Venerable Sona became one of the arahants. Then it occured to venerable Sona: What if I approach The Blessed One and declare my attainment. Venerable Sona approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on side and said: </P>
<P>Venerable sir, a worthy one, who has destroyed desires, has lived the holy life, done what should be done, put down the weight, come to the highest good, has destroyed the bond to be and is released rightfully knowing, is inclined to six things: He is inclined to non-sensuality, to seclusion, to non-oppression, to destruction of craving, to destruction of holdings and non-delusion.</P>
<P>It might occur to a certain venerable one, that the venerable one is inclined to non-sensuality completely founded on faith. Venerable sir, it should not be known in that manner. Venerable sir, the bhikkhu has destroyed desires, has lived the holy life, has done what should be done, has made it such that the self is not seen. Much is done for the destruction of greed and on account of freedom from greed, is inclined to non-sensuality Much is done for the destruction of hate and on account of freedom from hate, is inclined to non-sensuality. Much is done for the destruction of delusion and on account of freedom from delusion, is inclined to non-sensuality.</P>
<P>It might occur to a certain venerable one, that the venerable one does not desire gain honour and fame inclined to seclusion. Venerable sir, it should not be known in that manner. Venerable sir, the bhikkhu has destroyed desires, has lived the holy life, has done what should be done, has made it such that the self is not seen. Much is done for the destruction of greed and on account of freedom from greed, is inclined to seclusion Much is done for the destruction of hate and on account of freedom from hate, is inclined to seclusion. Much is done for the destruction of delusion and on account of freedom from delusion, is inclined to seclusion.</P>
<P>It might occur to a certain venerable one, that the venerable one is inclined to freedom from oppression hemmed in by the observance of virtues. Venerable sir, it should not be known in that manner. Venerable sir, the bhikkhu has destroyed desires, has lived the holy life, has done what should be done, has made it such that the self is not seen. Much is done for the destruction of greed and on account of freedom from greed, is inclined to freedom from oppression Much is done for the destruction of hate and on account of freedom from hate, is inclined to freedom from oppression.

Much is done for the destruction of delusion and on account of freedom from delusion, is inclined to the destruction of craving..</P>
<P>Much is done for the destruction of greed and on account of freedom from greed, is inclined to destruction of holding Much is done for the destruction of hate and on account of freedom from hate, is inclined to the destruction of holding. Much is done for the destruction of delusion and on account of freedom from delusion, is inclined to the destruction of holding.</P>

Much is done for the destruction of delusion and on account of freedom from delusion, is inclined to the destruction of delusion.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, to the bhikkhu with a mind thus rightfully released, even if a lot of forms come to the purview of the eye, they do not take hold of the mind and stay. They do not get mixed up and the mind stays unmoved and sees how they fade. Even if a lot of sounds come to the sphere of the ear, ... re ... even if a lot of smells come to the sphere of the nose, ... re ... even if a lot of tastes come to the range of the tongue, ... re ... even if a lot of touches come to the range of the body, ... re ... even if a lot of ideas come to the purview of the mind, they do not take hold of the mind and stay. They do not get mixed up and the mind stays unmoved and sees how they fade.</P>
<P>Venerble sir, like a huge storm with rain coming from the east, to a rock not broken or fissured of equal thickness everywhere, would not shake or move ... re ... coming from the west, ... re ... from the north, ... re ... from the south. Likewise venerable sir, to the bhikkhu with a mind thus rightfully released, even if a lot of forms come to the purview of the eye, they do not take hold of the mind and stay. They do not get mixed up and the mind stays unmoved and sees how they fade. Even if a lot of sounds come to the sphere of the ear, ... re ... even if a lot of smells come to the sphere of the nose, ... re ... even if a lot of tastes come to the range of the tongue, ... re ... even if a lot of touches come to the range of the body, ... re ... even if a lot of ideas come to the purview of the mind, they do not take hold of the mind and stay. They do not get mixed up and the mind stays unmoved and sees how they fade.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The secluded mind inclined to non-sensuality and non-oppression,<BR>
The not deluded mind inclined to destruction of holding and craving.<BR>
Seeing the non arising of the mental faculties, is released rightfully.<BR>
Such a rightfully released bhikkhu has no duties to do or to be done.<BR>
A rock of equal thickness would not move with the wind<BR>
Likewise forms, tastes, sounds, scents, touches or anything<BR>
Agreeable or disagreeable would not change him<BR>
The steady released mind, reflects the fading.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>006.02. At that time venerable Pagguna was gravely ill and venerable &acirc;nanda approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said: </P>
<P>Venerable sir, venerable Pagguna is gravely ill, it's good if The Blessed One would approach him out of compassion. The Blessed One accepted in silence. The Blessed One getting up from his evening seclusion, approached venerable Pagguna. Venerable Pagguna seeing The Blessed One coming in the distance, tried to get down from the bed, and The Blessed One said, do not move from the bed, there are seats prepared in front, I will sit there. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and said to venerable Pagguna: Pagguna, how are you, are things agreeable, would you survive. Are unpleasant feelings receding or proceeding? Is the receding end or the proceed end that is evident?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, things are not agreeable, I would not survive. I feel grave unpleasant feelings proceeding not receding. The proceeding end is evident not the receding end. Venerable sir, it is like a strong man cleaving my top with the edge of a sharp knife. In like manner, venerable sir, my top is crushed with a lot of air.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, things are not agreeable, I would not survive. I feel grave unpleasant feelings proceeding not receding. The proceeding end is evident not the receding end. Venerable sir, it is like a strong man giving a tight head wrap. In like manner, venerable sir, there is a lot of pain in my head.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, things are not agreeable, I would not survive. I feel grave unpleasant feelings proceeding not receding. The proceeding end is evident not the receding end. Venerable sir, it is like a butcher were cleaving my stomach with a butcher's cleaving knife. In like manner, venerable sir, my stomach is crushed with a lot of air.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, things are not agreeable, I would not survive. I feel grave unpleasant feelings proceeding not receding. The proceeding end is evident not the receding end. Venerable sir, it is like two strong men taking a weaker one by his limbs and scorching him in a pit of charcoal. In like manner, venerable sir, there is a lot of burning in my body.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, things are not agreeable, I would not survive. I feel grave unpleasant feelings proceeding not receding. The proceeding end is evident not the receding end. Then The Blessed One advising, inciting and making the heart light of venerable Pagguna, got up from his seat and went away,</P>
<P>Soon after The Blessed One was gone, venerable Pagguna passed away. At the time of his passing away his faculties became bright. Then venerable &acirc;nanda approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on side and said. Venerable sir, soon after The Blessed One had gone, venerable Pagguna passed away. At the time of his passing away his faculties became bright.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, why shouldn't the bhikkhu Pagguna's faculties not brighten up. The bhikkhu Pagguna's mind was not released from the five bonds that bound him to the sensual world, hearing the Teaching his mind was released from the bonds that bound him to the sensual world. &acirc;nanda, there are six benefits for hearing the Teaching at the correct time, and investigating the meaning.

<P>Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa appoints six species, such as the dark species, the blue species, the red species, the turmeric species, the pleasant species and the highly pleasant species. Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa's dark species are the slaughterers of sheep, pigs, killers of birds, hunters, rough fishermen, killers of robbers keepers of prisons and any others doing fierce activities. Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa's blue species are the bhikkhus inconsistent in observing virtues and others with the view of actions and results. Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa's red species are the Niganthas and those wearing a single robe. Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa's yellow species are the lay disciples wearing white clothes and the disciples who do not wear clothes. Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa's pure species are the ascetics male and female who make a living in a peculiar way. Venerable sir, Purana Kassapa's highest pure species are Nanda Vaccha, Kisa Sankicca, Makkhali Gosala. Venerable sir, these are the six species appointed by Purana Kassapa.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, are the six species appointed by Purana Kassapa accepted by the whole world? No, venerable sir.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, like a poor incapable man against his wish is made to observe saying `Good man, you should eat flesh and not earn money for it. In the same manner, Purana Kassapa without the acknowledgement of these recluses and Brahmins has appointed these six species foolishly, not knowing the manner to do it. &acirc;nanda, I too appoint the six species. Listen carefully and attend to it Yes venerable sir. &acirc;nanda, what are the six species?</P>

At that time, many elder bhikkhus were assembled in the circular hall after returning from the alms round and discussing the deeper aspects of the Teaching. At that time venerable Citta Hatthisariputta was disturbing the conversation of the elder bhikkhus with this and other conversation. Then venerable MahaKo&ntilde;&ntilde;hita said to Citta Hatthisariputta: Venerable Citta Hatthisariputta you should not disturb the elder bhikkhus discussing the deeper aspects of the Teaching, with this and other conversation. You should wait until the conversation finishes and then talk.</P>
<P>Then the co-associates of venerable Citta Hatthisaraputta said to venerable MahaKo&ntilde;&ntilde;hita: : Vener&agrave;ble MahaKo&ntilde;&ntilde;hita, do not depreciate venerable Citta Hatthisariputta, he is wise, it is possible for him to converse on the deeper aspects of the Teaching with the elder bhikkhus.</P>
<P>Friend, it is difficult to be known by those who do not know the range of thoughts of others.</P>
<P>Here, friend, a certain person would be gentle, obedient and appeased as long as under the protection of the Teacher or under the protection of an eminent teacher. Withdrawn from the Teacher or an eminent teacher he mixes up with the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples male and female. kings and the ministers of kings, with those of other faiths and their disciples. Abiding with that association, diffused and engaged in talk, the mind touched with greed and corrupted he would give up the holy life and come to low life. Like a bull that eats the thriving corn, is bound or put in the cattle fold and someone was to say, now the bull will not eat the thriving corn. Is it right when you say, now the bull will not come to eat the thriving corn? No, venerable sir. There is a possibility for the bull to break the bonds, or break the cattlefold and descend to eat the thriving corn. In like manner, a certain person would be gentle, obedient and appeased as long as under the protection of the Teacher or under the protection of an eminent teacher. Withdrawn from the Teacher or an eminent teacher he mixes up with the bhikkhus, bhikkhunis, lay disciples male and female. kings and the ministers of kings, with those of other faiths and their disciples. Abiding with that association, diffused and engaged in talk, the mind touched with greed and corrupted he would give up the holy life and come to low life.</P>
<P>Here, friend, a certain person secluded from sensual desires ... re ... attains to the first higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the first higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus, ... re ... he would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Like huge rain drops falling on the four crossroads, would make the mud to disappear and someone saying,. now these crossroads would not be muddy any more. Is it correctly said? No, venerable sir. There is a possibility that it would be made muddy by people passing by, or when cattle and other four-footed pass by, or by the blowing of the hot wind or with snot it would be made muddy again. In like manner, a certain person secluded from sensual desires ... re ... attains to the first higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the first higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus, ... re ... he would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Here, friend, a certain person overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts ... re ... attains to the second higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the second higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus, ... re ... he would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Like a huge flat land close to a village or hamlet, in which the heavy rain has made the stones and pebbles to disappear and someone saying,&otilde;ow this flat land would not be with stones and pebbles any more. Is it correctly said? No, venerable sir. There is a possibility that people should come to drink in this flat land and cattle and other four-footed should come to drink in it, or by the blowing of the hot wind or with snot it would be with stone and pebbles again. In like manner, a certain person secluded from sensual desires ... re ... attains to the second higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the second higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus, ... re ... he would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Again, a certain person with equanimity to joy and detachment ... re ... attains to the third higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the third higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus, ... re ... he would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Like a man partaking exalted food would not desire stale food, and someone saying,. now this man will not like any other food Is it correctly said? No, venerable sir. There is a possibility that when the nourishment of the exalted food is absorbed and when it is no more in his body he would like food again. In like manner, a certain person with equanimity to joy and detachment ... re ... attains to the third higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the third higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus, ... re ... he would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Here, friend, a certain person dispelling both pleasantness and unpleasantnes ... re ... attains to the fourth higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the fourth higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus, ... re ... he would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>In the declivity of a huge rock there is a pond free of winds and waves and someone saying,. now there will be no more waves in the pond. Is it correctly said? No, venerable sir. There is a possibility that a huge storm with rain should come from the east, from the west, ... re ... from the north, ... re ... from the south. They will arouse waves in the pond. In like manner, a certain person secluded from sensual desires ... re ... attains to the fourth higher state of mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the fourth higher state of mind he mixes up with the bhikkhus, ... re ... he would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Here, friend, a certain person not attending to any sign, attains to the signless concentration of the mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the signless concentr&agrave;tion of the mind, mixes up with the bhikkhus, ... re ... he would give up the holy life and come to the low life.</P>
<P>Like the king or the king's chief minister who has come on the highway with the fourfold army, stays in the forest for one night and on account of the sounds of elephants, horses, chariots, the foot soldiers, the sound of drums small and large and the sound of conches. the sound of the crickets have vanished. Now the sound of crickets will not be heard in this forest stretch. Is it correctly said? No, venerable sir. There is a possibility that when that king or the king's chief minister goes away from that forest stretch the sounds of the crickets will appear again. In like manner, a certain person not attending to any sign, attains to the signless concentration of the mind. Thinking I am the gainer of the signless concentr&agrave;tion of the mind, mixes up with the bhikkhus, ... re ... he would give up the holy life and come to low life.</P>
<P>After that Citta Hatthisariputta giving up the holy life came to the lower life. The co-associates of Citta Hatthisariputta approached venerable Mahakottita, and asked Did venerable Mahakottita penetratingly know the mind of Citta Hatthisariputta, that although Citta Hatthisariputta is a gainer of these abidings and attainments, yet he will give up the holy life and come to lay life? Friend, I penetratingly saw the mind of Citta Hatthisariputta, as a gainer of these abidings and attainments and knew he would give up the holy life and come to lower life. Even the gods informed me about this. Then the co-associates of Citta Hatthisariputta approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said to The Blessed One: Venerable sir, Citta Hatthisariputta is a gainer of these abidings and attainnments, yet he gave up the holy life and came to the lower life. Bhikkhus, before long Citta will come to the non-sensual sphere.</P>
<P>Then before long Citta Hatthisariputta shaved his head and beard and wearing yellow clothes left the household and went forth. Then Citta Hatthisariputta withdrawing from the crowd and abiding diligent to dispel, before long, in this very life by himsself realizing attained the noble end of the holy life, for which sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless. He knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Venerable Citta Hatthisariputta became one of the noble ones.</P>

The Blessed One deviating from the path sat on the prepared seat at the root of a tree. The bhikkhus too entered Dandakappa to make dwellings. Venerable &acirc;nanda approached river Acirawathie with many bhikkhus to wash their bodies. Having washed their bodies in river Acirawathie and coming out of the river were standing in one robe until the body got dried.</P>
<P>Then a certain bhikkhu approached venerable &acirc;nanda and said: </P>
<P>Friend, &acirc;nanda, did The Blessed One consider everything before he declared that Devadatta is decreasing, gone to hell, is in serious trouble until the end of the world cycle. Or did he declare it in another way. Friend, it was declared in that manner.</P>

How could he contradict, that which I have definitely stated. &acirc;nanda, there is no other person whom I have so well considered, as this Devadatta. &acirc;nanda, I did not see any thing pure in him, as much as the tip of a hair. Therefore, I declared that Devadatta is decreasing, gone to hell, is in serious trouble until the end of the world cycle. &acirc;nanda, there is a pit, filled with excreta to the height of a man. A man is sunk in it together with his head. To a certain man the desire arises for his welfare, to pull him out of the pit of excreta to end his unpleasantness. He goes round the pit of excreta yet does not see even the tip of a hair by which to pull him out. In like manner &acirc;nanda, I did not see anything pure in him, as much as the tip of a hair.
