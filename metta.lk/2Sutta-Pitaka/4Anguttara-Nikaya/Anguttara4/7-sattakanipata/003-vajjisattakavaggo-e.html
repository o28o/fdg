</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>003.01. I heard thus. At one time the Blesed One was abiding in the Sarandada monument in Vesali. Then many Licchavis approached The Blessed One worshipped sat on a side and The Blessed One said to the Licchavis: I will teach you seven things for non-decrease, listen and attend carefully .

<P>Licchavis. what are the seven things for non-decrease?</P>

<P>As long as the Vajjis do not appoint new rules and do not break already appointed rules and as long as the ancient laws of the Vajjis are observed, their growth not decrease should be expected.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>003.02. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijja peaks in Rajagaha. At that time king Aj&agrave;tasattu of Magadha the son of Vedeha was to attack the Vajjis. He said. I will destroy the powerful Vajjis, I will put them into trouble.</P>
<P>Then king Aj&agrave;tasattu of Magadha the son of Vedeha addressed the Brahmin Vassakara the chief minister of Magadha: Brahmin, approach The Blessed One, in my words worship him with your head at his feet and ask whether he has a light and pleasant abiding and tell The Blessed One: Venerable sir, king Aj&agrave;tasattu of Magadha, son of Vedeha worships The Blessed One with his head at the feet of the Blessed and asks whether The Blessed One abides with few ailments, lives lightly and has a pleasant abiding and also tell venerable sir, king Aj&agrave;tasattu of Magadha the son of Vedeha wants to attack the Vajjis. He says. I will destroy the powerful Vajjis, I will put them into trouble. To whatever The Blessed One says, listen carefully and report it back to me. Thus Gone Ones do not tell lies.</P>
<P>Brahmin Vassakara the chief minister of Magadha agreed to do the words of k ing Aj&agrave;tasattu of Magadha and approached The Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side, and said to The Blessed One: Good Gotama, king Aj&agrave;tasattu of Magadha the son of Vedeha wants to attack the Vajjis. He says. I will destroy the powerful Vajjis, I will put them into trouble.</P>
<P>At that time venerable &acirc;nanda was standing behind The Blessed One fanning him, The Blessed One addressed venerable &acirc;nanda: &acirc;nanda, do you hear that the Vajjis assemble constantly? Yes, venerable sir, I have heard that the Vajjis assemble constantly.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, as long as the Vajjis assemble constantly their growth not decrease should be expected.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, do you hear that the Vajjis get together in unity for their activities and dismiss in unity? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis get together in unity for their activities and dismiss in unity. As long as the Vajjis get together in unity for their activities and dismiss in unity, their growth not decrease should be expected.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, do you hear that the Vajjis do not appoint new rules and do not break already appointed rules? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis do not appoint new rules and do not break the already appointed rules.</P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis do not appoint new rules and do not break already appointed rules and as long as the ancient laws of the Vajjis are observed, their growth not decrease should be expected.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, do you hear that the Vajjis revere and esteem the elder Vajjis and consider to listen to them? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis revere and esteem the elder Vajjis and consider to listen to them.</P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis honour, revere and esteem the elder Vajjis and consider to listen to them, their growth not decrease should be expected.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, do you hear that the Vajjis do not force and oppress women and girls of high clans to live with them? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis do not force and oppress women and girls of high clans to live with them.</P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis do not use force and oppress women and girls of high clans to live with them, their growth not decrease should be expected.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, do you hear that the Vajjis worship esteem and honour the Vajji monuments internally and externally, giving whatever offerings earlier given without interrupting them? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis worship, esteem and honour the Vajji monuments internally and externally, giving whatever offerings earlier given without interrupting.</P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis worship, esteem and honour the Vajji monuments internally and externally giving whatever offerings earlier given without interrupting them, their growth not decrease should be expected.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, do you hear that the Vajjis arrange the rightful protection of the worthy ones so that those who have not come to the kingdom would come and those already come would abide pleasantly? Yes, venerable sir, I hear that the Vajjis arrange the rightful protection of the worthy ones, so that those who have not come to the kingdom would come and those already come would abide pleasantly.</P>
<P>As long as the Vajjis arrange the rightful protection of the worthy ones so that those who have not come would come to the kingdom and those who have already come would abide pleasantly, their growth not decrease should be expected.</P>
<P>Then The Blessed One addressed the Brahmin Vassakara: Brahmin, at one time I was abiding in the Sarandada monument and I taught the Vajjis these seven non-decreasing things. So long as the Vajjis abide by those non-decreasing things, their growth is to be expected not their decrease.</P>
<P>Good Gotama, to the Vajjis endowed with one of these things, increase should be expected not decrease. To them observing these seven things undoubtedly increase should be expected not decrease. Good Gotama, king Aj&agrave;tasattu of Magadha, the son of Vedeha cannot do it, other than by a battle, a persuation or breaking up their unity. Now we will go, we have much work to do. Brahmin, do as you think fit. The Brahmin Vassakara delighting and agreeing with the words of The Blessed One got up from his seat and went away.</P>
