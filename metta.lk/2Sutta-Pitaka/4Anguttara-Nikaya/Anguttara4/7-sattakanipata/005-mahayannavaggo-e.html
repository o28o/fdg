</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>005.04. At that time the Brahmin with a lofty body was going to offer a great sacrifice. So five hundred bulls, five hundred young bulls, five hundred young cows, five hundred goats, five hundred sheep, were brought to the sacrificial post to be sacrificed. Then the Brahmin with the lofty body approached The Blessed One exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said to The Blessed One: </P>
<P>Good Gotama, I have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good results.</P>
<P>Brahmin, I too have heard that, setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good results.</P>
<P>For the second time the Brahmin with the lofty body said, ... re ... for the third time the Brahmin with the lofty body said. Good Gotama, I have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good results.</P>
<P>Brahmin, I too have heard that, setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good results. Then good Gotama, our ideas agree, yours and mine.</P>
<P>When this was said venerable &acirc;nanda said to the Brahmin with a lofty body-&ucirc; Brahmin, that is not how you should question the Thus Gone One. You should do it thus.</P>
<P>Good Gotama, I have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and with good results. I too have a desire to set fire and raise the sacrificial post. Venerable sir, advise me on this, so that it would be for my welfare and pleasantness for a long time.</P>
<P>Then the Brahmin with a lofty body said to The Blessed One Good Gotama, I have heard that setting fire and raising the sacrificial post is of much benefit and good results. I too have a desire to set fire and raise the sacrificial post. Venerable sir, advise me on this, so that it would be for my welfare and pleasantness for a long time.</P>
<P>Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with unpleasant results. What three?</P>
<P>The bodily weapon, the verbal weapon and the mental weapon.</P>
<P>Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, arouses the mind -Kill this amount of bulls for the sacrifice! Kill this amount of young bulls for the sacrifice! Kill this amount of cows for the sacrifice! Kill this amount of goats for the sacrifice! Kill this amount of sheep for the sacrifice! Thinking I do good, he does evil. .</P>
<P>Thinking I do merit, he does demerit. Thinking I search the path to heaven, he searches the path to hell. Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with unpleasant results. .</P>
<P>Again, Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, says such words -Kill this amount of bulls for the sacrifice! Kill this amount of young bulls for the sacrifice! Kill this amount of cows for the sacrifice! Kill this amount of goats for the sacrifice! Kill this amount of sheep for the sacrifice! Thinking I do good, he does evil. Thinking I do merit, he does demerit. Thinking I search the path to heaven, he searches the path to hell. Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with unpleasant results.</P>
<P>Again, Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice himself makes endeavour -Kill the bulls for the sacrifice! Kill the young bulls for the sacrifice! Kill the cows for the sacrifice! Kill the goats for the sacrifice! Kill the sheep for the sacrifice! Thinking I do good, he does evil. Thinking I do merit, he does demerit. Thinking I search the path to heaven, he searches the path to hell. Brahmin, the one who lights the fire and raises the sacrificial post, even before the sacrifice, raises three weapons, three demerits, three yielders of unpleasantness with unpleasant results.</P>
<P>Brahmin, these three fires should be dispelled, avoided, should not be followed after. What three? The fire of lust, the fire of hatred and the fire of delusion.</P>
<P>Brahmin, why should the fire of lust be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after? Brahmin, with lust, overcome by lust one misbehaves by body, speech and mind. Having misbehaved by body, speech and mind, after death a certain one goes to decrease, to loss, to hell. Therefore the fire of lust should be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after.</P>
<P>Brahmin, why should the fire of hatred be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after? Brahmin, with hatred, overcome by hatred one misbehaves by body, speech and mind. Having misbehaved by body, speech and mind, after death a certain one goes to decrease, to loss, to hell. Therefore the fire of hatred should be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after.</P>
<P>Brahmin, why should the fire of delusion be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after? Brahmin, deluded and overcome by delusion one misbehaves by body, speech and mind. Having misbehaved by body, speech and mind, after death a certain one goes to decrease, to loss, to hell. Therefore the fire of delusion should be dispelled, avoided and should not be followed after.</P>
<P>Brahmin, these three fires should be revered, esteemed, honoured and fostered with rightful pleasantness. What three?</P>
<P>The fire worthy of offerings, the household fire and the fire worthy of gifts.</P>
<P>Brahmin, what is the fire worthy of offerings?</P>
<P>Brahmin, mother or father is the fire worthy of offerings. What is the reason? Brahmin, I am adored and produced from them. Therefore mother and father are the fire worthy of offerings&ograve;hey should be revered, esteemed, honoured and fostered with rightful pleasantness.</P>
<P>Brahmin, what is the fire of the household?</P>
<P>Brahmin, sons, wife, slaves, messengers and workmen are the household fire. Therefore the household fire should be revered, esteemed, honoured and fostered with rightful pleasantness.</P>
<P>Brahmin, what is the fire worthy of gifts?</P>
<P>Here, Brahmin, of those recluses and Brahmins who have given up false teachers, some train to be patient and gentle, a certain one tames himself, a certain one appeases himself, a certain one extinguishes. Brahmin, this is the fire worthy of gifts. The fire worthy of gifts should be revered, esteemed, honoured and fostered with rightful pleasantness.</P>
<P>Brahmin, as for the fire of firewood, from time to time it should be lighted, attended to, put out and put aside.</P>
<P>When this was said the Brahmin with the lofty body said thus: I understand good Gotama. Remember me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts. Now I will release the five hundred bulls, the five hundred young bulls, the five hundred cows, the five hundred goats and the five hundred sheep I will bestow their lives, may they eat green grass, may they drink cool water, may they feel the cool air blowing.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>005.10. I heard thus. At one time venerable S&agrave;riputta and venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na were touring the southern hilly region with a large Community of bhikkhus. At that time the female lay disciple Velukantaki Nanda having got up in the last watch of the night was reciting loudly the Parayana Vagga.</P>
<P>At that time Vessavana the great king of gods heard the female lay disciple Nanda reciting the Parayana Vagga loudly and waited till it finished.</P>
<P>The female lay disciple Nanda finished reciting the Parayana Vagga and became silent. Knowing that the female lay disciple Nanda had finished reciting, applauded her saying &szlig;Good sister!&ucirc; Then she asked. &szlig;Who is this good one?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Sister I am Vessavana the great king of gods&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good one, you have thievishly listened to my recitation&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good! Sister, then this will be another theft. Tomorrow the Community of bhikkhus headed by S&agrave;riputta and Moggall&agrave;na without taking the morning meal are coming to Velukandaka, offering food to that Community of bhikkhus, make it my offering. May that also be a theft of mine.&ucirc;</P>
<P>The female lay disciple Nanda at the end of that night prepared nourishing eatables and drinks in her home.</P>
<P>Then the Community of bhikkhus headed by S&agrave;riputta and Moggall&agrave;na without having the morning meal entered Velukandaka. The female lay disciple Nanda addressed a certain man and said: Good one, go to the monastery and tell the Community of bhikkhus that the meal is ready at the female lay disciple Nanda's home.&ucirc;</P>
<P>He agreed and going to the monastery informed the Community of bhikkhus: Venerable sirs, the meal is ready at the female lay disciple Nanda's home. The Community of bhikkhus headed by S&agrave;riputta and Moggall&agrave;na putting on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes approached the house of the female lay disciple Nanda and sat on the prepared seats.</P>
<P>Then the female lay disciple Nanda with her own hands offered nourishing eatables and drinks to the Community of bhikkhus headed by S&agrave;riputta and Moggall&agrave;na and satisfied them.</P>
<P>Then knowing venerable S&agrave;riputta had finished taking the meal and had put aside the bowl, the female lay disciple Nanda sat on a side and venerable S&agrave;riputta said: &szlig;Nandamata, who informed you about the arrival of the Community of bhikkhus?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, venerable sir, I got up in the last watch of the night and reciting loudly the Parayana Vagga became silent.</P>
<P>Then Vessavana the great king of gods knowing that I had finished reciting the Parayana Vagga applauded me, saying &szlig;Good! Sister!&ucirc; Then I asked. &szlig;Who is this good one?&ucirc;</P>
<P>and he said: &szlig;Sister I am Vessavana the great king of gods&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good one, you have thievishly listened to my recitation&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good! Sister, then this will be another theft. Tomorrow the Community of bhikkhus headed by S&agrave;riputta and Moggall&agrave;na without taking the morning meal are coming to Velukandaka, offering food to that Community of bhikkhus, make it my offering. May that also be a theft of mine.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, whatever merit be the outcome of this gift may it be for the pleasantness of Vessavana the great king of gods.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig; It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, that you have spoken face to face with such a powerful majestic son of gods!&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising thing. Venerable sir, I had a single loved son Nanda, for some reason or other the king pulled him away, oppressed him and killed him. Venerable sir, when my child was pulled away, oppressed, and killed, I do not recall of the least change in my mind".</P>
<P>&szlig; It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of mind.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising thing. Venerable sir, my husband died and was born with a certain clan of demons. Now he appears to me as he was in his last birth. On account of that, I do not recall of the least change in my mind".</P>
<P>&szlig; It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of mind.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising thing. Venerable sir, from the day I was brought by my husband as a child, I do not recall of an instance of going beyond his mental state, I have never searched outside bodily pleasures". .</P>
<P>&szlig; It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of mind.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising thing. Venerable sir, from the day I confessed to be a female lay disciple I do not recall of trespessing the least of the precepts. .</P>
<P>&szlig; It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of mind.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising thing. Venerable sir, when I desire, secluding my mind from sensual desires and demeritorious things, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion I abide in the first higher state of mind. Overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts, the mind in one point, internally appeased with joy and pleasantness born of concentration I abide in the second higher state of mind. With equanimity to joy and disenchantment, I experience pleasantness and mindful awareness with the body and attain to the third higher state of mind, to this the noble ones say, mindfully abiding in pleasantness with equanimity. Dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness and earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure, cleaning the mind so that it is without unpleasantness and pleas&agrave;ntness I attain to the fourth higher state of mind&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig; It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of mind.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, that is not all, there is another wonderful and surprising thing. Venerable sir, I do not see a single of these bonds binding to the sensual world in me, according to the way declared by The Blessed One.".</P>
<P>&szlig; It is wonderful and surprising Nandamata, your development and purity of mind.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then venerable S&agrave;riputta advising, inciting and making the heart light of the female lay disciple Nanda with a talk got up and went away.</P></FONT></BODY>
