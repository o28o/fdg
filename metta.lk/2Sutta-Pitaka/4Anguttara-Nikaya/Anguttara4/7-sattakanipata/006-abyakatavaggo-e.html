</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>006.03. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living among the Gijja peaks in Rajagahs. When the night was waning two gods illuminating the whole of the Gijja peaks with a resplendent light approached The Blessed One, worshipped and stood on a side. Standing one of the gods said thus to The Blessed One: &szlig;Venerable sir, these bhikkhunis are released" The other one said: &szlig;Venerable sir, these bhikkhunis are well released without substratum remaining." Saying it, they stood for the approval of the Teacher. Knowing that the Teacher approves, worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One and disappeared from there.</P>
<P>The Blessed One at the end of that night addressed the bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, when last night was waning two gods illuminating the whole of the Gijja peaks with a resplendent light approached me, worshipped and stood on a side. Standing one of the gods said thus - &szlig;Venerable sir, these bhikkhunis are released" The other one said: &szlig;Venerable sir, these bhikkhunis are well released without substratum remaining." Saying it they stood for my approval. Knowing that I approve, worshipped, circumambulated me and disappeared from there.</P>
<P>At that time venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na was seated close to The Blessed One, and it occured to venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na-"To which kind of gods does this knowledge be -when with substratum, is with substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum? At that time a bhikkhu named Tissa had passed away recently and was born in a certain Brahma world. He is very powerful and should know this."</P>
<P>Then venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na as a strong man would bend his stretched arm or stretch his bent arm disappeared from the Gijja peaks and appeared in the world of Brahma. Brahma Tissa seeing venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na approaching in the distance, said: Welome! Sir Moggall&agrave;na! It is after a long time that you got this chance to come here. Sir, the seat is ready, take a seat. Venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na sat on the prepared seat and Brahma Tissa too worshipped venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na and sat on a side. Then venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na said to Brahma Tissa: "To which kind of gods does this knowledge be -when with substratum, is with substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum?" Sir, to gods born in the world of Brahma this knowledge arises. -when with substratum, is with substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum.</P>
<P>Tissa, does this knowledge -'when with substratum, is with substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum' arise to all gods in the world of Brahma? No, venerable sir, this knowledge -'when with substratum, is with substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum' does not arise to all gods in the world of Brahma.'</P>
<P>Venerable sir, those gods satisfied with the life span, beauty happiness, fame and authority of the world of Brahma, do not know of some escape more noble than that, as it really is. To them this knowledge -'when with substratum, is with substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum' does not arise.

As long as his body will stand, they will show him to gods and men. After the breakup of the body, they will not show him to gods and men. Thus sir, Moggall&agrave;na, to those gods there is the knowledge 'when with substratum, is with substratum and when without substratum, is without substratum'</P>
<P>Here, sir, Moggall&agrave;na, there is a bhikkhu released through wisdom. Those gods know him thus: `This venerable one is released through wisdom.

<P>Here, sir, Moggall&agrave;na, there is a bhikkhu, a body witness. Those gods know him thus: `This venerable one is a body witness. If this venerable one partakes suitable dwellings, associates spiritual friends and conducts properly in the mental faculties for whatever reason sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless that noble end of the holy life, he will undoubtedly attain here and now and realizing abide.

<P>Then venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na as a strong man would bend his stretched arm or stretch his bent arm, disappeared from the world of Brahma, appeared among the Gijja peaks, approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and related the whole conversation that took place between him and the Brahma Tissa</P>
<P>&szlig;Moggall&agrave;na, didn't Brahma Tissa tell you about the seventh person, who abides without a sign?." Venerable sir, this is the time to teach about the person who abides without a sisgn The bhikkhus hearing it from The Blessed One will bear it. Then Moggall&agrave;na, listen and attend carefully I will tell. Venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na conscnted and The Blessed One said: </P>

Venerable sir, of the here and now benefits of benevolence declared by The Blessed One I do not develop so much faith in The Blessed One. I myself know these benefits Venerable sir, I know that I am a giver of gifts, a benefactor. Noble Ones who show compassion, show compassion to me first.

Thus open and uncoverd the mind should be developed. There is a possiblilty for that sluggishness to disappear if you abide thus.</P>
<P>Abiding in this manner if that sluggishness does not disappear, you should determine a walk perceiving the start and the end with the mental faculties turned inwards and the mind not allowed to wander. There is a possiblilty for that sluggishness to disappear if you abide thus.</P>
<P>Abiding in this manner if that sluggishness does not disappear, you should turn to the right side and making the lion's posture, go to sleep keeping one foot over the other and mindful of the time of rising. When awake quickly get out of bed thinking I will not enjoy the sluggish pleasure.</P>
<P>Moggall&agrave;na, you should train in this manner. I will not enter families `with the glory of a bhikkhu.' In families there are various kinds of work to be done. When people come, the bhikkhu is not attended. Then it occurs to the bhikkhu: Who has disrupted my friendship in this family, now these people are not amiable. Thus with that loss is confused. To the confused is agitation. The agitated are not restrained. The mind of one not restrained is far from concentration.</P>
<P>Moggall&agrave;na, you should train in this manner. I will not enter into disputes. When it is a dispute, there is much talk. When there is much talk there is agitation. The agitated are not restrained. The mind of one not restrained is far from concentration.</P>
<P>Moggall&agrave;na, I do not praise all associations neither do I depreciate all associations. I do not approve the association between householders and those gone forth. I appreciate the abounding of dwellings which are noiseless, free from humans, suitable for solitude and seclusion.</P>
<P>When this was said venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na said thus to The Blessed One: </P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, saying it in short, how is the bhikkhu released with the destruction of craving reaching the highest, ending the holy life and become the topmost among gods and men?"</P>
<P>Here, Moggall&agrave;na the bhikkhu becomes learned, all things are not suitable to settle in. Moggall&agrave;na, of that mind that all things are not suitable to settle in, the bhikkhu becomes learned. He learns all things and thoroughly learns them. Thoroughly knowing all things feels whatever feelings, pleasant, unpleasant or neither unpleasant nor pleasant. He abides seeing impermanence, disenchantment, cessation and giving up those feelings. When abiding seeing impermanence, disenchantment, cessation and giving up of those feelings he abides not holding to anything in the world. Not holding does not worry and without worries is by himself extinguished. He knows, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Moggall&agrave;na, saying it in short, the bhikkhu, released with the destruction of craving reach the highest, end the holy life and become the topmost among gods and men in this manner.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>006.09. Bhikkhus, do not fear to do good. Pleasantness is a synonym for good. Bhikkhus, I know of enjoying the results of pleasing and agreeable good, done long ago. I developed the thought of loving kindness for seven years and did not come to this world for seven forward and backward world cycles. During the forward world cycles I was a god of radiance and during the backward world cycles I was born in an empty paradise of Brahma.</P>
<P>There, I was Brahma, Brahma the great, the unconquered lord and master with sure insight, holding authority for seven times. Thirty six times I was Sakka the kng of gods. Innumerable hundreds of times I was the righteous universal monarch, winning the four directions and establishing states. Bhikkhus, I was endowed with these seven jewels, such as the jewel of the wheel, the elephant, the horse, the jewel, the woman, the householder and the advisor. Bhikkhus, I had over a thousand courageous sons with valiant figures, for crushing foreign armies. They lived ruling over the earth righteously, without weapons as far as the limit of the ocean.</P><DIR>

<P>Look at the results of good, how merits bring pleasantness.<BR>
Developing the thought of loving kindness for seven years<BR>
I did not come to this world for seven forward and backward world cycles<BR>
During the forward world cycles I was a radiant god<BR>
And during the backward world cycles was born in an empty paradise of Brahma<BR>
There I was Great Brahma for seven times, wielding authority.<BR>
Thirty six times I was king of gods, ruling over the gods.<BR>
Innumerable hundreds of times I became universal monarch in Jambudipa<BR>
Head anointed warriors were the leaders of the people<BR>
They ruled without punishments and weapons. I advised them,<BR>
To rule this earth without force and impartially.<BR>
Thus I earned for the clan much wealth and resources.<BR>
I was endowed with the five strands of sense pleasures and the seven jewels<BR>
By the enlightened ones showing compassion for the world<BR>
It was told was the cause for my greatness and success in the world.<BR>
With much resources and means I became a powerful, famous king in India.<BR>
Who would not be pleased to hear this other than those born in darkness<BR>
Therefore desiring your own good, honour the Teaching recollecting the dispensation.</P></DIR>

The Blessed One putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes approached the household of An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika and sat on the prepared seat. At that time in the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika's home there was great commotion. The householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. The Blessed One said: </P>
<P>&szlig;What is the reason for such a commotion in your house, it is like fishermen hauling a catch of fish?</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, Sujatha Gharusunha is brought back from an oppulent family, she does not heed to mother-in law, father-in-law or to the husband, and does not even honour, revere esteem and worship The Blessed One."</P>
<P>Then The Blessed One addressed Sujatha Gharusunha. &szlig;Come! Sujatha!"</P>
<P>Sujatha Gharusunha replying &szlig;Yes, venerable sir." Approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. The Blessed One said: </P>
<P>&szlig;Sujatha, there are seven kinds of wives to a man. What seven?</P>
<P>A wife comparable to a murderer, to a robber, to a lady, to a mother, to a sister, to a friend and to a slave woman. These are the seven wives to a man. Of these which one, are you?</P>
<P>Venerable sir, I do not understand this short exposition of The Blessed One. Good! If it is explained to me, so that I may know the detailed meaning. Then Sujatha, listen, attend carefully I will tell. The Blessed One said.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Without compassion the mind defiled, attached to another man she belittles her husband.<BR>
Bought for money, intent on slaying this is the murderer wife for a man.<BR>
A woman enjoying the wealth of her husband, skills, merchandise and agricultural things<BR>
If intent on stealing, even a little, this is the robber wife for a man.<BR>
Not active, lazy, greedy, rough and talking rough cutting words,<BR>
She overrides the powers of her husband, this is the lady wife for a man.<BR>
Always compassionately, one protects her husband, like a mother her son.<BR>
So also protects his wealth and everything. She is a mother wife to a man.<BR>
Like an elder sister honouring her younger brother, she lives with him,<BR>
With a shameful mind. She is the sister wife for a man.<BR>
She who delights seeing her husband, like meeting a friend after a long time,<BR>
She is well-bred, with chastity and virtues. She is the friendly wife for a man.<BR>
Molested with a stick is appeased, bears with the husband<BR>
With an undefiled mind, she is the wife comparable to a slave.<BR>
The murderous, the robbing and the ladylike wives,<BR>
Are unvirtuous, rough and without love, after death are born in hell.<BR>
The wives comparable to a mother, a sister, a friend and a slave<BR>
Are virtuous, with well-developed self, after death are born in heaven.<BR>
Sujatha these are the seven wives to a man. Of them what are you?<BR>
Venerable sir, from today remember me as a slave wife to my husband.</P></DIR>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>006.11. Bhikkhus, these seven things cause hostility in co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man. What seven?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should be ugly!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in the beauty of another co-wife</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, however well bathed, anionted, has shaved head and beard and is dressed in white, yet he is ugly overcome with hate. Bhikkhus, this is the first thing that causes hostility on account of co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man.</P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should sleep badly!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in another co-wife's pleasant sleep</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, however well he sleeps on a sofa, covered with long woollen fleece, with woollen coverlets with carpets made of deer hide for the ground, with overhead cannopies and two red cushions on either side, yet he sleeps badly, overcome with hate. Bhikkhus, this is the second thing that causes hostility on account of co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man.</P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should not have in abundance!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in another co-wife's abundance!"</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, seizes the useless and thinks I have taken hold of the useful, seizing the useful thinks I have taken hold of the useless. To him grasping these things wrongly it conduces to unwelcome unpleasantness for a long time. Bhikkhus, this is the third thing that causes hostility on account of co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man.</P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should not have wealth!' What is the reason? `Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in another co-wife's wealth.'</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, whatever wealth he has amassed with aroused effort and toiling with his hands when sweat dripped, so rightfully earned, that too the king takes away and puts in the treasury. Bhikkhus, this is the fourth thing that causes hostility on account of co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man.</P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should not be famous!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in another co-wife's fame.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, whatever fame he has earned through diligence perishes. Bhikkhus, this is the fifth thing that causes hostility on account of co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man.</P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should not have friends!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in another co-wife's friendships</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, whoever friends, co-associates blood relations be they avoid him from a distance. Bhikkhus, this is the sixth thing that causes hostility on account of co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man.</P>
<P>Again, hikkhus, a co-wife desires for her opponent: `O! she should go to loss, to decrease to hell after death!' What is the reason? Bhikkhus, a co-wife is not delighted in another co-wife's going to heaven</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, a hateful man overcome by hate and overwhelmed by it, misbehaves by body, by speech and mind and after death goes to loss, to decrease is born in hell. Bhikkhus, this is the seventh thing that causes hostility on account of co-wives arousing hatred in a woman or man.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The hateful one is ugly, sleeps badly, leaving aside the useful does the useless,<BR>
Doing destruction with body and words, overwhelmed with hate,<BR>
He comes to destruction of wealth, and is disgraced as a hateful.<BR>
Relations, friends, and well wishers avoid the hateful as he arouses bad feelings.<BR>
Fear arises with it and people do not know about it.<BR>
They do not know the least good thing and the least good in the Teaching,<BR>
When angry, man is in pitch darkness, he destroys easily, something difficult to correct<BR>
When anger abates, he has remorse as burnt with fire<BR>
He exhibits his evil mind, like dust evident in the air.<BR>
The human when angry is not shameful, has no remorse and gentle words.<BR>
One overcome with hate does not see any light,<BR>
Actions to be put aside, in the Teaching are far removed from him<BR>
Therefore I inform, consider it carefully. The hateful kill father,<BR>
His own mother, the noble one and the ordinary man<BR>
The hateful one kills his mother who fed, reared, showed him the world<BR>
And gave him life, he also kills ordinary folk<BR>
Those beings should be compared to oneself, the self is extremely dear<BR>
The hateful infatuated one kills in various ways<BR>
They kill the self with the sword, eat poison, tie themselves with bonds,<BR>
Or die in mountain grottos, doing actions that destroy beings and themselves.<BR>
The hateful do not know that hate is decrease<BR>
Thus with hate they house in Death's snare.<BR>
Cut it up, with taming with wisdom, effort and right view<BR>
The wise should cut up demerit and train the evil mind,<BR>
Dispelling hate, troubles and greed, tame the self and extinguish without desires.</P>
