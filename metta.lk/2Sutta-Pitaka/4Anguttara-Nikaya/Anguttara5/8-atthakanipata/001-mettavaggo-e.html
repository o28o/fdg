<P>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu frequently developing, making it a habit, a foundation and undertaking it thoroughly, the release of the mind in loving kindness could expect eight benefits. What eight?</P>
<P>Sleeps pleasantly, rises pleasantly, does not see evil dreams, becomes loveable to humans, and non-humans, the gods protect him, and fire, poison or weapons do not have an effect on him. If he does not penetrate further, is born in the world of Brahma.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, the bhikkhu frequently developing, making it a habit, a foundation and undertaking it thoroughly, the release of the mind in loving kindness could expect these eight benefits.</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>He that develops the thought of loving kindness limitlessly and thoughtfully<BR>
Sees his bonds diminish with the destruction of endearments<BR>
If one person is pervaded with loving kindness without anger, it is merit<BR>
The noble ones do much merit pervading all beings with compassion.<BR>
They that win over the earth teeming with beings,<BR>
Go round quarrelling to do offerings and sacrifices of horses and men<BR>
It is not worth one fourth, not even one sixteenth of a developed mind<BR>
In loving kindness, its like the moon's rays and the stars<BR>
He that does not strike, kill overthrow or make produce<BR>
Develops loving kindness to all beings without any anger.</P></DIR>

May other good bhikkhus not be spoilt.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, just as to one measuring a mass of grains, there is the grain that is well ripen in one heap, then there is the grain that is weakly ripen the rubbish heap, thrown out by the wind. The farmer takes a broom and sweeps it out far away. What is the reason? May the good grain be not spoilt. In the same manner&ntilde;o any person it might occur in his approaching, receding, looking on, looking back stretching and bending, bearing the three robes, taking bowl and robes, he is the same as any other good bhikkhu - as long as his fault is not seen. When his fault is seen, he will be known as a highway robber recluse, a prattling recluse, a recluse of rubbish. He should be known thus and others should not be atoned for it. What is the reason? May other good bhikkhus not be spoilt.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, like a man in want of tubes to carry drinking water, taking a sharp axe would enter the forest. Of the trees that he knocks with the sharp axe, the strong well-developed tress resound roughly. The trees that are internally decayed and ooze filth, when knocked with the axe resound with a crashing noise. He cuts its root and the top and cleans the inside and applies it to take water. In the same manner&ntilde;o any person it might occur in his approaching, receding, looking on, looking back stretching and bending, bearing the three robes, taking bowl and robes, he is the same as any other good bhikkhu - as long as his fault is not seen. When his fault is seen, he will be known as a highway robber recluse, a prattling recluse, a recluse of rubbish. He should be known thus and others should not be atoned for it. What is the reason? May other good bhikkhus not be spoilt.</P><DIR>

<P>Living together know them as with evil desires, anger<BR>
Merciless, obdurate, spiteful, selfish, envious and crafty<BR>
Talking kindly arousing emotion, talks like a recluse.<BR>
He has secret activity, evil view and aversion<BR>
Has low activity, tells lies, know them as they really are.<BR>
All should get together and turn him out<BR>
Turn out the rubbish and clean the dispensation.<BR>
Thus turn out the prattling non-recluse in the guise of a recluse.<BR>
Turning out the one with evil desires and evil conduct<BR>
Live united with the pure and thoughtful and end unpleasantness.</P>
