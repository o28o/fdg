</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>002.01. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was living in Vera大a under a Nimba tree raised on reeds. Then a Brahmin of Vera大a approached The Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said: -</P>
<P>Good Gotama, I have heard this. The recluse Gotama does not worship, attend on, offer a seat or invite Brahmins who are aged, decayed and have come to the end of their lives. Good Gotama, is it the truth. Doesn't good Gotama worship, attend on, offer a seat or invite Brahmins who are aged, decayed and have come to the end of their lives. Good Gotama, it is not the right conduct.</P>
<P>&szlig;Brahmin, I do not see in this world together with its gods, M&agrave;ra, Brahma and the Community of recluses and Brahmins, any one, to worship, attend on, offer a seat or invite. Brahmin, if the Thus Gone One worships, attends on, offers a seat or invites someone his head would split.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama does not enjoy matter!.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama does not enjoy matter. Brahmin, the enjoyments of forms, sounds, smells, tastes and touches are dispelled to the Thus Gone One, pulled out from the roots, made a palm stump, made a thing that would not rise again. Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama does not enjoy matter. This is not told about you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama does not possess wealth!&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama does not possess wealth. Brahmin, the possessions of forms, sounds, smells, tastes and touches are dispelled to the Thus Gone One, pulled out from the roots, made a palm stump, made a thing, that would not rise again. Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama does not possess wealth. This is not told about you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama teaches non-doing!&ucirc;</P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama teaches non-doing. Brahmin, I teach non-doing of bodily misbehaviour, verbal misbehaviour and mental misbehaviour and the non-doing of various kinds of demerit. Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama teaches non-doing. This is not told about you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama teaches annihilation!&ucirc;</P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama teaches annihilation. Brahmin, I teach the annihilation of greed, hate and delusion and the annihilation of various kinds of demerit. Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama teaches annihilation. This is not told about you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama teaches loathing!&ucirc;</P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama teaches loathing. Brahmin, I teach the loathing of bodily misbehaviour, verbal misbehaviour and mental misbehaviour and the loathing of various kinds of demerit. Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama teaches loathing. This is not told about you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama is a disciplinarian!&ucirc;</P>
<P>Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama is a disciplinarian. Brahmin, I teach to discipline greed, hate and delusion and to disscipline the various kinds of demerit. Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama is a disciplinarian. This is not told about you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama exercises self control!&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, is said the recluse Gotama exercises self control. Brahmin, I teach exercising control over of various kinds of demerit of bodily misbehaviour, verbal misbehaviour and mental misbehaviour. The Thus Gone One exercising control over various kinds of demerit, they are dispelled, pulled out from the roots, made a palm stump, made a thing that would not rise again Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said, the recluse Gotama exercises self control.</P>
<P>This is not told about you.</P>
<P>&szlig;The recluse Gotama is unobtrusive!&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Brahmin, there is a method, according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama is unobtrusive Brahmin, I do not search a womb for the future, for rebirth in the future. It is dispelled, pulled out from the roots, made a palm stump, made a thing that would not rise again. Therefore I am unobtrusive. Brahmin, to the Thus Gone One lying in a womb, and future rebirth are dispelled pulled out from the roots, made a palm stump, a thing that would not rise again. Brahmin, this is the method according to which, it is rightfully said the recluse Gotama is unobtrusive. This is not told about you.</P>
<P>Brahmin, the hen sits on the eggs in eight or ten or twelve places so that they are well sat on, made ripe and treated and the life in the adled eggs break the shell of the egg with the nails of the feet or the beak and breaking the shell are reborn healthily. What is it, is it senior or junior? Good Gotama, it is senior.</P>
<P>Brahmin, in the same manner I who was with the ignorant populace shrouded in darkness, have broken the shell of ignorance by myself realized, noble rightful enlightenment. Brahmin, I am the senior and the foremost in the world. My effort is aroused not shaken, mindfulness is established, unconfused, the body is appeased and without anger, the concentrated mind is in one point.</P>
<P>Brahmin, then I secluding the mind from sensuality and demeritorious things, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abide in the first higher state of the mind. Overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts, the mind internally appeased in one point I abide in the second higher state of the mind without thoughts and discursive thoughts. With equanimity to joy and disenchantment I experience pleasantness with the body too and abide in the third higher state of the mind. To this the noble ones say abiding in pleasantness being mindful of equanimity. Dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure I abide in the fourth higher state of the mind purifying the mind with equanimity so that it is without unpleasantness and pleasantness.</P>
<P>When the mind is thus concentrated, purified, without blemish, workable and imperturbable I direct the mind to recollect the manifold previous births. Such as one birth, two three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, innumerable forward world cycles, innumerable backward world cycles and innumerable forward and backward world cycles of births. There I was with such name, clan, disposition, supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with such a life span. Disappearing from there I was born here. Thus I recollected with all details the manifold previous births.</P>
<P>Brahmin, this is my first arising of knowledge in the first watch of the night, darkness vanished and light arose, when abiding diligent with aroused effort to dispel. As it happened to the arisen life in the egg shell.</P>
<P>When the mind is thus concentrated, purified, without blemish, workable and imperturbable I direct the mind to know the disappearing and appearing of beings. With the heavenly eye purified beyond human I see beings disappearing and appearing in unexalted and exalted states, beautiful and ugly, in good and evil states, I know beings according their actions: &szlig;These good beings endowed with bodily, verbal and mental misconduct blaming noble ones and bearing wrong view after death are born in loss, in a bad state in decrease is born in hell. These good beings endowed with bodily, verbal and mental good conduct not blaming noble ones bearing right view. After death are born in gain, in a good state in increase is born in heaven, I know beings according to their actions.</P>
<P>Brahmin, this is my second arising of knowledge in the second watch of the night, darkness vanished and light arose, when abiding diligent with aroused effort to dispel. As it happened to the arisen life in the egg shell.</P>
<P>When the mind is thus concentrated, purified, without blemish, workable and imperturbable I direct the mind for the destruction of desires. I know as it really is, this is unpleasant, this is the arising of unpleasantness, this is the cessation of unpleasantness and this is the path to the cessation of unpleasantness: I know as it really is, these are desires, this is the arising of desires, this the cessation of desires and this is the path to the cessation of desires, as it really is. When I knew and saw thus my mind was released from sensual desires, from desires to be, and from desires of ignorance. When released knowledge arose my mind is released. `Birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, I knew, there is nothing more to wish.</P>
<P>Brahmin, this is my third arising of knowledge in the last watch of the night, darkness vanished and light arose, when abiding diligent with aroused effort to dispel. As it happened to the arisen life in the egg shell.</P>
<P>When this was said the Brahmin of Vera大a said thus to The Blessed One: &szlig;Good Gotama is the foremost! Good Gotama is the most superior! I understand good Gotama. It is like something overturned is reinstated. Something covered is made manifest. As though the path is shown to someone who had lost his way. Thus in many ways the Teaching is declared. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. I am a lay disciple from today until life lasts.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>002.02. At one time The Blessed One was living in the gabled hall in the Great Forest in Vesali. At that time many well-known Licchavis assembled and seated in the assembly hall were talking in praise of The Blessed One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus.</P>
<P>The general Siha was also seated in that gathering and it occurred to Siha &szlig;Without doubts The Blessed One should be worthy and rightfully enlightened that these well-known Licchavis assembled and seated talk the praise of The Blessed One, the Teaching and the Community in various ways.&ucirc; Then the general Siha approached Nigantha Nataputta and said to him: "Venerable sir, I desire to approach the recluse Gotama.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Siha, you a man of action, why do you want to see the recluse Gotama of non-action? Siha, the recluse Gotama, teaches non-action and disciplines, disciples for non-action. Then general Siha's intentions of going to see The Blessed One subsided.</P>
<P>For the second time many well-known Licchavis assembled and seated in the assembly hall were talking in praise of The Blessed One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus.</P>
<P>The general Siha was also seated in that gathering and it occurred to Siha &szlig;Without doubts The Blessed One should be worthy and rightfully enlightened that these well-known Licchavis assembled and seated talk the praise of The Blessed One, the Teaching and the Community in various ways.&ucirc; Then the general Siha approached Nigantha Nataputta and said to him:? &szlig;Venerable sir, I desire to approach the recluse Gotama.&ucirc;</P>

<P>For the third time many well-known Licchavis assembled and seated in the assembly hall were talking in praise of The Blessed One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus.</P>
<P>The general Siha was also seated in that gathering and it occured to Siha &szlig;Without doubts The Blessed One should be worthy and rightfully enlightened that these well-known Licchavis assembled and seated talk the praise of The Blessed One, the Teaching and the Community in various ways.&ucirc; Then it occurred to the general Siha: &szlig;What is the use of the consent of these Niganthas? I will approach to see The Blessed One worthy and rightfully enlightened.&ucirc;.</P>
<P>Then the general Siha with about five hundred carriages went to Vesali during the daytime to see The Blessed One. Approaching as far as the carriages could go, descended from the carriages and went on foot. The general Siha approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said to The Blessed One: </P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, I have heard this said: 'The recluse Gotama teaches non-action and disciplines his disciples for non action. Venerable sir, those who said `the recluse Gotama teaches non-action and disciplines disciples for non-action' How far are they saying the words of The Blessed One and not accusing The Blessed One falsely. Are they saying it according to the Teaching and not falsely accusing The Blessed One? We do not like to accuse The Blessed One for what he has not said.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Siha, rightly saying there is a method of mine according to it -the recluse Gotama teaches non-action and disciplines his disciples in non-action.</P>

<P>Siha, rightly saying there is a method of mine according to it -the recluse Gotama gives comfort disciplines his disciples to gain comfort.</P>
<P>Siha, what is that method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama teaches non-action and disciplines disciples for non-action? Siha, I tell non-doing of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct and mental misconduct and various demeritorious things.</P>
<P>Siha, this is the method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama teaches non-action and disciplines disciples for non-action.</P>

<P>Siha, this is the method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama teaches action and disciplines disciples for action.</P>
<P>Siha, what is that method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama teaches annihilation and disciplines, disciples for annhilation? Siha, I tell the annhilation of greed, hate and delusion and various kinds of demeritorious things.</P>
<P>Siha, this is the method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama teaches annihilation and disciplines disciples for annihilation.</P>

<P>Siha, this is the method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama is a disciplinarian and disciplines disciples.</P>
<P>Siha, what is that method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama teaches self control and disciplines disciples for self control? Siha, I tell the self control of demeritorious things of bodily misconduct, verbal misconduct and mental misconduct. Siha, whosever demeritorious things are dispelled by self control, pulled out from the root, made a palm stump, made a thing that would not grow again. I tell he is self controlled.</P>
<P>Siha, this is the method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama teaches self control and disciplines disciples for self control.</P>
<P>Siha, what is that method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama teaches not entering another womb and disciplines disciples for not entering another womb? Siha, whosever future lying in a womb and future rebirth is dispelled pulled out from the roots, made a palm stump that would not grow again. I tell he does not enter another womb. The Thus Gone One not lying in a womb has dispelled future birth. Has pulled it out with the roots, it is made a palm that would not grow again.</P>
<P>Siha, this is the method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama does not enter a womb, and disciplines disciples for it.</P>
<P>Siha, what is that method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama teaches comfort and disciplines disciples for comfort? Siha, I am the most comforted one and I teach disciples and discipline them for the highest comfort.</P>
<P>Siha, this is the method of mine, which rightfully says the recluse Gotama teaches comfort and disciplines disciples for comfort".</P>
<P>When this was said the general Siha said to The Blessed One: -"Venerable sir, I understand! ... re ... venerable sir, bear me as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts".</P>
<P>&szlig;Siha, make a thorough investigation. It's suitable for well-known people like you.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, on account of this too I am very much satisfied with The Blessed One, that The Blessed One says to me `Siha, make a thorough investigation. It's suitable for well-known people like you'.&ucirc;</P>
<P>`Venerable sir if my discipleship was gained by those of other faiths, they would have taken me throughout Vesali under their banner saying `The general Siha has come to our faith. Here The Blessed One says Siha, make a thorough investigation. It's suitable for well-known people like you.' Now I take refuge in The Blessed One, the teaching and the Community of bhikkhus for the second time. I am a disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts".</P>
<P>&szlig;Siha, for a long time your clan has been a welling spring to the Niganthas'. You should think to offer them morsel food at their arrival.&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, on account of this too I am very much satisfied with The Blessed One, that The Blessed One says to me `Siha, for a long time your clan has been a welling spring to the Niganthas'. You should think to offer them morsel food at their arrival.'&ucirc;</P>
<P>`Venerable sir I have heard it said-' The recluse Gotama said it- Offerings should be made to me. Offerings should be made to my disciples only. The highest benefits are for offerings given to me and my disciples.. Here The Blessed One makes arrangements for offerings to be made to the Niganthas' Here, venerable sir, we should know the right time to offer. Now I take refuge in The Blessed One, the teaching and the Community of bhikkhus for the third time. I am a disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then The Blessed One gave a graduated sermon to the general Siha such as talking on giving gifts, virtues, heavenly bliss, the dangers of sensuality, the defiling nature of folly and vanity and the benefits of giving up. When The Blessed One knew that the mind of the general Siha was ready, tender, free from obstructions, exalted and pleased, he gave the special message of the enlightened ones such as unpleasantness, the arisisng of unpleasantness, the cessation of unpleasantness and the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness.</P>
<P>Just as a pure cloth free of any impurity would take the dye evenly, in the same manner the pure stainless eye of the Teaching appeared to the general Siha seated there itself- &szlig;Whatever arisen thing has the nature of ceasing".</P>
<P>Then the general Siha then and there mastered the Teaching, knew the teaching, penetrated it, dispelled doubts and becoming confident did not want a another teacher in the dispensation and said to The Blessed One- &szlig;Venerable sir, accept tomorrow's meal from me together with the Community bhikkhus.&ucirc; The Blessed One accepted in silence.</P>
<P>The general Siha knowing that The Blessed One had accepted the invitation, worshipped, circumambulated The Blessed One and went away. The general Siha then addressed a certain man and said: Go and find what meat there is in the market! The general Siha at the end of that night prepared various kinds of nourishing eatables and drinks in his home and informed The Blessed One: - &szlig;Venerable sir, the food is ready, it is the right time.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then The Blessed One putting on robes in the morning, and taking bowl and robes approached the house of the general Siha together with the Community of bhikkhus and sat on the prepared seats. At that time many Niganthas were walking from street to street and from junction to junction with raised hands saying &szlig;Today the general Siha has killed fat cattle and has prepared food for the recluse gotama. The recluse Gotama knowing the meat is prepared on account of him partakes it.&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then a certain man approached the general Siha and whispered in his ear: &szlig;Sir, know that many Niganthas are walking from street to street and from junction to junction with raised hands saying &szlig;Today the general Siha has killed fat cattle and has prepared food for the recluse gotama. The recluse Gotama knowing the meat is prepared on account of him partakes it. Sir, from a long time these venerable ones depreciate The Blessed One, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. Accusing The Blessed One with unreal false statements, these venerable ones cannot destroy the fame of The Blessed One in this manner. We would not destroy the life of any living thing knowingly!&ucirc;</P>
<P>The general Siha offered nourishing eatables and drinks to the Community of bhikkhus headed by The Blessed One with his own hands and satisfied them. Knowing The Blessed One had finished taking the meal the general Siha sat on a side. The Blessed One advised him incited him and made his heart light giving a talk and getting up went away.</P>

<P>Here, the king's thoroughbred is pure in breed on both sides; mother's and father's. Is one born in that region where other thoroughbreds are born. Whatever food given to him- wet or dry he eats carefully not throwing it about. Loathes to sit or lie on urine and excreta. Is gentle and pleasant and does not terrify other horses. All craftinesses, fraud and deceit are explained to him as it really is, by the horse trainer. The horse trainer makes an effort to subdue that horse and rides it.

<P>Paharada, just as, whatever rivers in the world and all the rain that falls from the sky rushing to the great ocean, does not make the ocean less or more. In the same manner many bhikkhus entering the element of extinction, does not show decrease or increase.
