<P>&szlig;Bhikkhus, bear that the householder Ugga of Vesali is endowed with eight wonderful and surprising things.&ucirc; Saying this the Well Gone One went into the monastery.</P>
<P>Then a certain bhikkhu putting on robes in the morning, taking bowl and robes approached the home of the householder Ugga of Vesali and sat on the prepared seat. The householder Ugga of Vesali approached that bhikkhu, worshipped and sat on a side. Then that bhikkhu said to Ugga, the householder of Vesali: </P>
<P>&szlig;Householder, The Blessed One has declared, that you are endowed with eight wonderful and surprising things. Householder, what are those eight wonderful and surprising things with which you are endowed, as told by The Blessed One?&ucirc; &szlig;Venerable sir, I do not know of the wonderful and surprising things that The Blessed One has declared. Yet there are eight wonderful and surprising things evident in me. Listen and attend carefully, I will tell&ntilde;hem. That bhikkhu consented and the householder Ugga of Vesali said: </P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, on the first day I saw The Blessed One approaching in the distance, together with that sight, my mind got established in faith. This is the first wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, with that delighted mind I attended on The Blessed One. The Blessed One gave me a graduated sermon. Such as the benefits, of giving gifts, being virtuous, about heavenly bliss, the dangers of sensuality, the defiling nature of vile and low things and the benefits of giving up. When The Blessed One knew that my mind was ready, tender, free from obstructions, exalted and pleased, he gave me the special message of the enlightened ones such as unpleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, the cessation of unpleas&agrave;ntness and the path leading to the cessation of unpleasantness.</P>
<P>Just as a pure cloth free of any impurity would take the dye evenly, in the same manner the pure stainless eye of the Teaching appeared to me, seated there itself- &szlig;Whatever arisen thing has the nature of ceasing&ucirc;. .</P>
<P>Then and there I mastered the Teaching, knew the teaching, penetrated it, dispelled doubts and becoming confident did not want another teacher in the dispensation. There itself, I took refuge in The Blessed One, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus and observed these five precepts of the holy life. This is the second wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, I had four wives, virgines. I approached them and told them -'Sisters I have observed the five precepts of the holy life. If you desire, partake this wealth and also do merit. Or else go to your relations. Or else if you desire any man, I will give you to him. When this was said the most senior of them said -'Noble son give me to the man of this name.' I sent for that man with my left hand taking the hand of my wife and with the right hand taking the cerimonial water jar I sprinkled water and gave away the maiden to him. When giving up my wife I did not know of any change in my mind. This is the third wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, there is wealth in my clan, that too not divided among virtuous ones with good conduct. This is the fourth wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, if I associate bhikkhus, I do so carefully. This is the fifth wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, if venerable ones preach me, I listen carefully. If they do not preach, I preach them. This is the sixth wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, it is not surprising the gods approach me and tell- `Householder, the Teaching of The Blessed One is well declared'- Then I tell them-'Whether you tell it or not tell it, the Teaching of The Blessed One is well declared.' On account of this I do not feel any elation, about the gods approaching me or of my talking with the gods. This is the seventh wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, the bonds that The Blessed One says binds one to the sensual world, I do not see any of them not dispelled in me. This is the eighth wonderful and surprising thing, evident in me.

They go wrong in the good Teaching's definiteness<BR>
Like the merchant coming to the wrong ford, grieved long..<BR>
The man shrouded in ignorance goes wrong in the Teaching<BR>
And goes in existences going from birth to death long.<BR>
Those who achieved humanity and the well preached Teaching<BR>
Practised, will practise or practise those words<BR>
They lead the holy life and penetrate at the right moment<BR>
And come to the path declared by the Thus Gone Ones<BR>
They are the restrained wise, it was said by the kinsman of the sun.<BR>

This Teaching is for one satisfied, not for one dissatisfied. This Teaching is for the secluded, not for one attached to company. This Teaching is for one with aroused effort, not for the lazy. This Teaching is for one with established mindfulness, not for one without mindfulness This Teaching is for the concentrated, not for the distracted. This Teaching is for the wise, not for those lacking in wisdom.</P>
<P>The Blessed One knowing the discursive thought in venerable Anuruddha's mind, as a strong man would stretch his bent arm or bend his stretched arm disappearing from the dear park in the Bhesakala forest, among the Sunsumara peaks in the Bhagga country appeared before venerable Anuruddha in the western bamboo forest. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and venerable Anuruddha too sat on a side. The Blessed One said to venerable Anuruddha: </P>
<P>Anuruddha, your discursive thoughts are the thoughts of a Great Man! -This Teaching is for one with few desires, not for one with many desires. This Teaching is for one satisfied, not for one dissatisfied. This Teaching is for the secluded, not for one attached to company. This Teaching is for one with aroused effort, not for the lazy. This Teaching is for one with established mindfulness, not for one without mindfulness This Teaching is for the concentrated, not for the distracted. This Teaching is for the wise, not for those lacking in wisdom. Anuruddha, think of this eighth thought of a Great Man. -This Teaching is for the non-worldly, for those not attached to worldliness.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man, if you desire secluding the mind from sensual desires and demeritorious things, with thoughts and thought processes and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion you will abide in the first higher state of mind.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man, if you desire, overcoming thoughts and discursive thoughts, the mind internally appeased and brought to one point, you will abide in the second higher state of mind without thoughts and discursive thoughts with joy and pleasantness born of concentration.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man, if you desire, with equanimity to joy and disenchantment will abide mindful and aware and experience pleasantness with the body too. You will abide in the third higher state of the mind, to which the noble ones say, `mindfully abiding in pleasantness with equanimity.' .</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man, if you desire, dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, earlier having dispelled pleasure and displeasure, you abide in the fourth higher state of the mind.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man and abide in the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained for nothing, easily and quickly, your rag robe will be, for satisfaction, attachment without excitement, for a pleasant abiding and for extinction It would be like a robe taken out of a wardrobe of a householder or the son of a householder full of garments of various colours.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man and abide in the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained for nothing, easily and quickly, your meal of morsel food will be, for satisfaction, attachment without excitement, for a pleasant abiding and for extinction It would be like a meal prepared for a householder or the son of a householder with fine rice, the dark seeds picked, with various soups and curries.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man and abide in the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained for nothing, easily and quickly, your dwelling at the root of a tree will be, for satisfaction, attachment without excitement, for a pleasant abiding and for extinction It would be like a gabled house of a householder or the son of a householder, well painted with doors and windows, to shut out the wind.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man and abide in the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained for nothing, easily and quickly, your spread of grass for bed and seat will be, for satisfaction, attachment without excitement, for a pleasant abiding and for extinction It would be like a cushion in a carpeted room with deer skin hide with red cushions on either side, of a householder or the son of a householder.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, when you think of these eight thoughts of a Great Man and abide in the four higher states of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now gained for nothing, easily and quickly, your medicine of putrid urine will be, for satisfaction, attachment without excitement, for a pleasant abiding and for extinction It would be like various medicine such as ghee, butter, oil and molasses of a householder or the son of a householder.</P>
<P>Anuruddha, even after the rains you abide in Ceti in the western bamboo forest. Venerable Anuruddha consented and The Blessed One advising venerable Anuruddha disappeared from the western bamboo forest and appeared in deer the park in the Bhesakala forest in the Bhagga country. The Blessed One sat on the prepared seat and addressed the bhikkhus: </P>

<P>Venerable Anuruddha even after the rains abode in the western bamboo forest. Venerable Anuruddha abiding alone, withdrawn from the crowd, diligent to dispel before long attained that noble end of the holy life, for which the sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless. He here and now, realizing it abode and knew birth is destroyed the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. Venerable Anuruddha became one of the noble ones and uttered this solemn utterance that moment: .</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>The noble Teacher in the world, knowing my thoughts<BR>
Approached me mentally by his psychic powers.<BR>
The enlightened one attached to non-worldliness,<BR>
Taught me non-worldliness and I got attached to the dispensation .<BR>
Realizing the threefold knowledge I did my duty in the dispensation.</P>
