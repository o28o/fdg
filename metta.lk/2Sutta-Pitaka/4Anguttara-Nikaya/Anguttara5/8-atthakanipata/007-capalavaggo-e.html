<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, it is suitable that The Blessed One should teach me in short, hearing which I would withdraw from the crowd, alone, abide diligent to dispel."</P>
<P>&szlig;In this manner, a certain foolish man entreats me. To teach, they think to follow me only,. Saying: `Teach me in short! Well Gone One teach me in short! The words of The Blessed One would be of much use, to become an heir of the Teaching.' Therefore, bhikkhus, you should train in this manner: </P>
<P>`My mind will be internally well established. My mind should not be overcome by arisen demeritorious things. When your mind is internally well established not overcome by arisen demeritorious things, then you should train thus-'The release in loving kindness to me is well-developed, made much, made a habit, thoroughly practised to carry on, undisturbed, as an undertaking.</P>
<P>Bhikkhu, when that concentration is well-developed and made much, it develops with thoughts and with discursive thoughts, without thoughts it develops discursively, it develops without thoughts and without discursive thoughts. The concentration develops with joy and without joy. It develops with agreeability and with equanimity.</P>

<P>Bhikkhu, when the concentration is thus developed and thoroughly developed, you should further train thus: I will abide reflecting feelings in feelings mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure in the world. I will abide reflecting the mental states in the mind mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure in the world. I will abide reflecting thoughts in the Teaching, mindful and aware to dispel covetousness and displeasure in the world.</P>

<P>That bhikkhu thus advised by The Blessed One, got up from his seat, worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One and went away. That bhikkhu alone and withdrawn from the crowd, abode diligent to dispel. And before long, for whatever purpose sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and become homeless, that noble end of the holy life, he here and now by himself realizing abode. He thoroughly knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived, what should be done is done, there is nothing more to wish. He became a worthy one. &#9;</P>

<P>&acirc;nanda, the great earth is settled in water, water is settled in air and air is settled in space. There is a time when a great wind blows and agitates the water. The agitated water agitates the earth &acirc;nanda, this is the first reason for the occurance of a great earthquake.</P>
<P>Again, &acirc;nanda, a recluse, a Brahmin or a very powerful god who has power over his mind develops a little of the perception of earth and immeasurable perception of water and causes this earth to quake, tremble and shiver. &acirc;nanda, this is the second reason for the occurance of a great earthquake.</P>
<P>Again, &acirc;nanda, when the one seeking enlightenment disappears from the gods of pleasantness and mindful and aware enters the mother's womb, then this earth quakes, trembles and shivers. &acirc;nanda, this is the third reason for the occurance of a great earthquake.</P>
