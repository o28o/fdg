<P>Manly vigour, the bliss of protection, good friendship, balanced living, faith, virtues, benevolence and wisdom..Bhikkhus, these eight are accomplishments.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the achievement of manly vigour?</P>
<P>Here, Bhikkhus, in whatever trade the clansman makes a living -whether farming, trading, cattle rearing, rulership, serving the king or any other skill, he becomes clever not lazy and discriminative of what, has to be done and what has to be completed. Bhikkhus, this is the achievement of manly vigour.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the achievement of protection?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, whatever wealth be to the clansman achieved through manly vigour, righteously gained when toiling with his hands while sweat dripped, he protects. This my wealth should be protected so that it would not be carried away by the king, by robbers.or water or burnt by fire. It should not be carried away by unwanted inheritors. Bhikkhus, this is the achievement of protection.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is good friendship?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, in whatever village or hamlet the clansman lives -there may be householders or sons of householders, young, developed in virtues, or old, developed in virtues, endowed with faith, endowed with virtues, those benevolent and those endowed with wisdom. He stands with them, talks with them and discusses with them in such a manner that those with faith gain faith. The virtuous gain in virtues. The benevolent gain in benevolence and the wise gain wisdom. Bhikkhus, this is good friendship.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is balanced living?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the clansman's son knowing his income and expenses balances his budget In this manner my income is above my expenses and not my expenses are above my income. Like one holding the balance would know, this side is more by this much and this side is less by this much. In this manner the clansman's son knowing his income and expenses balances his budget In this manner my income is above my expenses and not my expenses are above my income. Bhikkhus, if the clansman's son with low income was to live spending much. It is said that the clansman's son lives as though eating figs. If the clansman's son with high income was to live spending little. It is said that the clansman's son lives as though dying a junior death. Bhikkhus, when the clansman's son balances his income with the expenses and lives, it is said he is balanced in expenses. </P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the attainment of faith?</P>
<P>Here, the son of the clansman has faith in the enlightenment of the Thus Gone One: That Blessed One ... re ... the Teacher of gods and men. Bhikkhus, this is the attainment of faith.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the attainment of virtues?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the son of the clansman abstains from destroying living things ... re ... taking intoxicating and brewed drinks Bhikkhus, this is the attainment of virtues.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the attainment of benevolence?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the clansman's son abides in the household with a mind free from the stains of selfishness, released in benevolence, with hands ready to give to the needy and making arrangements to give gifts. Bhikkhus, to this is said the attainment of benevolence.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, what is the attainment of wisdom?</P>
<P>Here, the clansman's son becomes wise about the rising and fading of the five holding masses for the noble penetration to rightfully end unpleasantness. Bhikkhus, to this is said the attainment of wisdom.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these four things conduce to the welfare and pleasantness of sons of clansmen here after.</P><DIR>
