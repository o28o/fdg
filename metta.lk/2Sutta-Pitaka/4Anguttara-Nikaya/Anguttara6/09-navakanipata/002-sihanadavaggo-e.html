Venerable S&agrave;riputta approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said: &szlig;Venerable sir, I have spent the rains in S&agrave;vatthi and desire to go to the states on a tour.&ucirc; &szlig;S&agrave;riputta, do as you think is suitable.&ucirc; Then venerable S&agrave;riputta getting up from his seat worshipped and circumambulated The Blessed One and went away. Soon after venerable S&agrave;riputta had gone, a certain bhikkhu said to The Blessed One: &szlig;Venerable sir, venerable S&agrave;riputta having hurt me, without a reconciliation has left on a tour.&ucirc; Then The Blessed One addressed a certain bhikkhu: &szlig;Come! Bhikkhu, address S&agrave;riputta, in my words- `Friend, S&agrave;riputta, The Blessed One calls you'&ucirc; That bhikkhu consenting, approached venerable S&agrave;riputta and said: &szlig;Friend, S&agrave;riputta, the Teacher calls you&ucirc; Venerable S&agrave;riputta consented to see The Blessed One. By that time venerable Mah&agrave;moggall&agrave;na and venerable &acirc;nanda were wandering from door to door with a bunch of keys. Saying &szlig;Venerable ones approach! There is going to be a lion's roar of venerable S&agrave;riputta, in front of The Blessed One.&ucirc; Then venerable S&agrave;riputta approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. When seated The Blessed One said: &szlig;Here, S&agrave;riputta, you have offended a certain co-associate in the holy life and without reconciling have left on a tour&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, if mindfulness of the body in the body was not established, I would have offended a certain co-associate in the holy life and without reconciling would have left on a tour.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, just as the earth accepts the pure and the impure, excreta, urine, saliva, pus, and blood, does not loathe or shrink on account of it. In the same manner, I abide with a mind comparable to earth, made great and immeasurable, without anger or ill will. Venerable sir, if mindfulness of the body in the body was not established, I would have offended a certain co-associate in the holy life and without reconciling, would have left on a tour.</P>

In the same manner, I abide with a mind comparable to a duster, made great and immeasurable, without anger or ill will. Venerable sir, if mindfulness of the body in the body was not established, I would have offended a certain co-associate in the holy life and without reconciling, would have left on a tour.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, just as an outcaste boy or girl in torn clothes with the begging basin in hand would enter a village or hamlet with a humble mind. In the same manner, I abide with a mind comparable to the mind of an outcaste boy or girl made great and immeasurable, without anger or ill will. Venerable sir, if mindfulness of the body in the body was not established, I would have offended a certain co-associate in the holy life and without reconciling, would have left on a tour.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, just like a tamed bull devoted to people, with its horns cut, would wander from street to street and from junction to junction without hurting anyone with its feet or horns. In the same manner, I abide with a mind, comparable to that of a bull with the horns cut, made great and immeasurable, without anger or ill will. Venerable sir, if mindfulness of the body in the body was not established, I would have offended a certain co-associate in the holy life and without reconciling, would have left on a tour.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, just as a woman, man or child fond of adornment, when had bathed the head, was to be wrapped round the neck with the carcase of a snake dog or a human would loathe it and be disgusted of it. In the same manner, I abide disgusted and loathing this putrid body. Venerable sir, if mindfulness of the body in the body was not established, I would have offended a certain co-associate in the holy life and without reconciling, would have left on a tour.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, just as a man using a perforated frying pan with the oil leaking In the same manner, I abide with this body which is perforated and leaking. Venerable sir, if mindfulness of the body in the body was not established, I would have offended a certain co-associate in the holy life and without reconciling, would have left on a tour&ucirc;</P>
<P>Then that bhikkhu getting up from his seat, and arranging his robe on one shoulder, putting his head at the feet of The Blessed One said: &szlig;Venerable sir, pardon me, I accused venerable S&agrave;riputta with untruthful, un-real accusation owing to foolishness and delusion. May The Blessed One pardon me, for future restraint. Bhikkhu, as you see your fault and ask for pardon, according to the Teaching, I pardon you. Bhikkhu, it is growth in the noble ones' discipline to see your fault and ask for pardon, according to the Teaching, for future restraint.</P>
<P>Then The Blessed One addressed venerable S&agrave;riputta: &szlig;S&agrave;riputta, pardon this foolish man, before his head splits in seven&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, I will pardon, if he says `venerable one pardon me.'&ucirc;</P>

Householder, they are the results of actions done carelessly.</P>
<P>Householder, gifts of coarse or exalted food may be given, that too carefully, with prior thinking, giving with one's own hand, not as though throwing away, appreciating the results of giving, and whenever the results of those actions follow, the mind tends to enjoy noble food, noble wealth, noble conveyances, the noble enjoyment of the five strands of sensuality. His wife, children, slaves, messengers and workmen, too are obident to him, lend ear to develop the mind. What is the reason? Householder, they are the results of actions done carefully.</P>
<P>Householder, in the past there was a Brahmin by the name Velama. He gave great gifts like this. He gave eightyfour thousand golden bowls with dipicted pictures filled with rupees, eightyfour thousand bowls with depicted pictures filled with gold, eightyfour thousand bronze bowls filled with gold. He gave eightyfour thousand elephants, decorated in gold and golden flags and covered with a golden net, eightyfour thousand chariots with the accessory lion skins, tiger skins, deer skins, orange blankets decorated in gold, and golden flags and covered with golden nets. He gave eightyfour thousand cows dressing them up in fine cloth with bronze pails to milk them. Gave eightyfour thousand maidens decorated with jewelled ear-rings. Gave eightyfour thousand cushions, deer skin rugs for covering and spreading, deer skin carpets, cannopies, red cushions for the two sides. He gave eighty four thousand crores of clothes, of dainty linen cloth, of dainty silk coth, of dainty woollen cloth, of daintily spun cloth. There is nothing to speak about eatables, drinks, hard food and nourishments, he distributed them like the flowing river.</P>
<P>Householder, it might occur to you: `The Brahmin Velama was someone else, who gave great gifts at that time. It should not be known like that. I was the Brahmin Velama at that time. I gave those great gifts. Householder, at that time there was no one suitable to offer gifts. None to purify gifts.</P>
<P>Householder, if the Brahmin Velama when giving those gifts satisfied a single one, who had come to righteousness of view, the benefits would have been very much more ... If the Brahmin Velama when giving those gifts satisfied one hundred, who had come to righteousness of view or a once returner, the benefits would have been very much more.
