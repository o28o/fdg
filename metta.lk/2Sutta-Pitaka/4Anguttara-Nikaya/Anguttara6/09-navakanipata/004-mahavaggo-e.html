</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>004.03. At one time venerable S&agrave;riputta was abiding in the squirrels' sanctuary in the bamboo grove in Rajagaha. Venerable S&agrave;riputta addressed the bhikkhus from there: </P>
<P>&szlig;Friends, extinction is pleasant! It is indeed pleasant! When this was said venerable Udayi said to venerable S&agrave;riputta: "Friend, what is pleasant in it, when there is nothing felt?"</P>
<P>&szlig;Friend, that is the pleasantness, when nothing is felt. Friend, there are these five strands of sensual pleasures. What five? Agreeable and pleasant forms, arousing fondness and sensual desires cognizable by eye consciousness Agreeable and pleasant sounds, ... re ... smells, ... re.. tastes, ... re ... and touches, arousing fondness and sensual desires cognizable by body consciousness. Friend, these are the five strands of sense pleasures. Whatever pleasure and pleasantness arises on account of these five strands of sense pleasures is called sensual pleasantness.</P>
<P>Here, friend, the bhikkhu secluded from sensual thoughts, ... re ... abides in the first higher state of the mind. To the bhikkhu abiding in the first higher state of mind, sensual perceptions attended with thoughts behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, is for oppression. In like manner sensual perceptions attended with thoughts behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever oppression is unpleasant. By this method too it should be known how extinction is pleasant.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu appeasing thoughts and discursive thoughts, ... re ... abides in the second higher state of the mind. To the bhikkhu abiding in the second higher state of the mind, perceptions attended with discursive thoughts behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, is for oppression. In like manner perceptions attended with discursive thoughts behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever oppression is unpleasant. By this method too it should be known how extinction is pleasant.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu with equanimity to joy and disenchantment, ... re ... abides in the third higher state of the mind. To the bhikkhu abiding in the third higher state of mind, perceptions attended with joy behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, is for oppression. In like manner perceptions attended with joy behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever oppression is unpleasant. By this method too it should be known how extinction is pleasant.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu dispelling pleasantness and unpleasantness, ... re ... abides in the fourth higher state of the mind. To the bhikkhu abiding in the fourth higher state of the mind, perceptions attended with equanimity behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, is for oppression. In like manner perceptions attended with equanimity behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever oppression is unpleasant. By this method it should be known how extinction is pleasant.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of matter and aversion, not attending various perceptions, ... re ... with space is boundless abides in the sphere of space. To the bhikkhu abiding in the sphere of space perceptions attended with matter behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, is for oppression. In like manner perceptions attended with matter behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever oppression is unpleasant. By this method too it should be known how extinction is pleasant.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of space and with consciousness is boundless, abides in the sphere of consciousness. To the bhikkhu abiding in the sphere of consciousness perceptions attended with space behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, is for oppression. In like manner perceptions attended with space behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever oppression is unpleasant. By this method too it should be known how extinction is pleasant.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of consciousness, with there is nothing abides in the sphere of no-thingness. To the bhikkhu abiding in the sphere of no-thingness, perceptions attended with space behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, to pleasantness, the arising of unpleasantness, is for oppression. In like manner perceptions attended with space behaving, becomes an oppression. Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever oppression is unpleasant.

Friend, The Blessed One has said, whatever oppression is unpleasant. By this method too it should be known how extinction is pleasant.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception abides in the cessation of perceptions and feelings To the bhikkhu abiding in the cessation of perceptions and feelings, with wise reflection desires get destroyed.

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>004.04. "Bhikkhus, to a foolish cow on a rock who does not know the right field to pasture, not clever to wander on uneven rocks, it occurs: `What if I go where I have not gone earlier, eat grass I have not eaten earlier, drink water I have not drunk earlier. Without establishing her forefeet well, she raises her hind feet. She does not go, where she has not gone earlier, does not eat grass not eaten earlier and does not drink water not drunk earlier. Standing in the place, where she earlier was, it would occur to her, what if I go where I have not gone earlier, eat grass I have not eaten earlier, drink water I have not drunk earlier. From that place too, she does not return harmlessly. What is the reason? . Bhikkhus, the foolish cow on the rock does not know the right field to pasture, is not clever to wander on uneven rocks.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner a certain foolish bhikkhu who does not know the right field to pasture and not clever to wander on the uneven rock secluding the mind from sensual and demeritorious thoughts, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first higher state of mind. He does not practice that sign, develop it and make much of it to penetrate and see it.</P>
<P>It occurs to him: `What if I overcome thoughts and discursive thoughts, internally appease the mind and with the mind in one point and with thoughts and discursive thoughts abide in the second higher state of the mind. It is not possible for him to overcome thoughts and discursive thoughts, internally appease the mind and bring it to one point and with thoughts and discursive thoughts abide in the second higher state of the mind.

Standing in the place, where she earlier was, it would occur to her, what if I go where I have not gone earlier, eat grass I have not eaten earlier, drink water I have not drunk earlier and return safely.

<P>Bhikkhus, in the same manner a certain wise bhikkhu who knows the right field to pasture, is clever to wander on the uneven rock, secluding the mind from sensual and demeritorious thoughts, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first higher state of mind.

He practices that sign, develops and makes much of it and penetratingly sees it.</P>
<P>It occurs to him: `What if I overcoming all perceptions of matter and perceptions of anger, not attending to various perceptions with space is boundless, abide in the sphere of space. Without disturbing the sphere of space, overcoming all perceptions of matter ... re ... he abides in the sphere of space He practices that sign, develops and makes much of it and penetratingly sees it .</P>
<P>It occurs to him: `What if I overcome all perceptions of space and with consciousness is boundless abide in the sphere of consciousness.

<P>Bhikkhus, when the bhikkhu abides in that attainment and rises from it his mind becomes gentle, workable, his concentration becomes immeasurable and well-developed The well-developed and concentrated mind, he directs for the realization of knowledge and mindfulness in that mental sphere, becomes the eye-witness for the respective knowledge.</P>

<P>If he desires, cognizes the minds of other beings; knows the mind with greed, without greed, with anger, without anger, with delusion, without delusion, the contracted mind, the distracted mind, the developed mind, the undeveloped mind, the mind with compare and the mind without campare, the concentrated and the unconcentrated mind, the released and the not released mind and mindfulness in that mental sphere becomes the eye-witness in the respective sphere.</P>

<P>&szlig;Friends, it is wonderful and surprising that The Blessed One who knows and sees, is worthy and rightfully enlightened does not leave any obstructions, for the purity and enlightenment of sentient beings, for overcoming grief and lament for realizing extinction for overcoming unpleasantness and displeasure. -The eye will be such, that there will be no feelings for forms seen. The ear will be such, that there will be no feelings for sounds heard. The nose will be such, that there will be no feelings for smells scented. The tongue will be such, that there will be no feelings for tastes tasted. The body will be such that there will be no feelings for bodily contacts.</P>
<P>When this was said venerable Udayi said: &szlig;Friend, &acirc;nanda, is it when perceptive in that mental sphere that feelings are not present or when not perceptive in that mental sphere?" &szlig;Friend, its when perceptive in the respective mental sphere not when not perceptive in the respective mental sphere."</P>
<P>&szlig;Friend, not perceptive of what, in the respective mental sphere are there no feelings?" "Here, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of matter and perceptions of anger, not attending to various perceptions, with space is boundless abides in the sphere of space. When thus perceptive there are no feelings in the respective mental spheres.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of space, with consciouness is boundless abides in the sphere of consciousness. When thus perceptive there are no feelings in the respective mental spheres.</P>
<P>Again, friend, the bhikkhu overcoming all perceptions of consciousness, with there is nothing abides in the sphere of no-thingness. When thus perceptive there are no feelings in the respective mental spheres.</P>
<P>Friend, at one time I was abiding in the deer park in the Anjana forest in Saketa. Then a bhikkhuni of the knotted hair sect approached me, worshipped and standing on a side said: Venerable sir, &acirc;nanda, that concentration which is not strained, nor turned aside, not with determinations that act as self denials, when abiding in it, is for release and pleas&agrave;ntness and is without remorse; for what fruit is that concentration, as told by The Blessed One?"</P>

He said.- `I abide with boundless knowledge, knowing and seeing, boundless worlds'</P>
<P>Venerable sir, this Nigantha Nathaputta too acknowledges having extensive knowledge and knowing everything, so also knowledge and vision that is complete- 'whether walking, standing, lying or awake, constantly and incessantly my knowledge and vision is established.' He said.- `I abide with boundless knowledge, knowing and seeing, boundless worlds' - Venerable sir, of these two who talk of knowledge and whose words are hostile to each other, whose words is the truth, and whose the lie?"</P>
<P>&szlig;Useless! Brahmins, leave it alone of these two who talk of knowledge and whose words are hostile to each other, whose words is the truth, and whose the lie. I will teach you attend carefully and listen. The Blessed One then said: thus-</P>
<P>Brahmins, there are four people standing in the four directions endowed with the highest speed and the longest span. Their speed is such, a well trained archer who is dextrous would quickly and lightly shoot through a palm and bring it down in an instant. Their span was such they placed one foot in the eastern ocean and the other in the western ocean. The man in the east would say, `I will make a journey to the end of the world. Stopping only for tasting, eating, drinking, urinating, excreting and to dispel sleepiness and weariness, with a life span of one hundred years, he goes for one hundred years and dies on the way, without reaching the end of the world.

Stopping only for tasting, eating, drinking, urinating, excreting and to dispel sleepiness and weariness, with a life span of one hundred years, he goes for one hundred years and dies on the way, without reaching the end of the world. What is the reason? Brahmin, there is no running, of this nature to know and understand the end of the world. I also don't declare the ending of unpleasantness without coming to the end of the world.</P>
<P>Brahmins, in the noble one's discipline, these five strands of sensual pleasures are known as the world. What five? Agreeable and pleasant forms arousing fondness and sensual desires cognizable by eye consciousness.

<P>Here, Brahmins, the bhikkhu secluding the mind from sensual desires and demeritorious things, with thoughts and discursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion abides in the first higher state of the mind. Brahmin, to this is called the bhikkhu abides at the end of the world, gone to the end of the world. Others would say, this also belongs to the world, it is not dismissed from the world. Brahmins, I too say this also belongs to the world, it is not dismissed from the world.</P>

Therefore my mind does not readily pursue, become delighted, get established and be released seeing appeasement in the cssation of perceptions and feelings. &acirc;nanda, then it occurred to me: `If I see the dangers of the sphere of neither perception nor non-perceptions practice it much, realize the benefits of the cessation of perceptions and feelings and practice it. There is a possibility that my mind should readily pursue, become delighted, get established and be released, seeing appeasement in the cessation of perceptions and feelings. &acirc;nanda, in the meantime, I practiced much to see the dangers of the sphere of neither perceptions nor non-perceptions and to see the benefits of the cessation of perceptions and feelings. Then my mind readily pursued, became delighted, got established and was released seeing appeasement in the cessation of perceptions and feelings. &acirc;nanda, then overcoming all perceptions of sphere of neither perception nor non -perceptions I abode in the cessation of perceptions and feelings. Seeing with wisdom desires got destroyed .</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, until I could attain to, and rise from, the nine successive abidings in the ascending and descending order I did not declare to the world, together with its gods and men, maras and brahmas and the Community of recluses and Brahmins and gods and men, that I have realized noble rightful enlightenment. When I could attain to, and rise from, the nine successive abidings in the ascending and descending order I declare to the world, together with its gods and men, maras and brahmas and the Community of recluses and Brahmins and gods and men, that I have realized noble rightful enlightenment. Knowledge and vision arose to me, my release is immovable. This is my last birth, there is no more birth.</P>
