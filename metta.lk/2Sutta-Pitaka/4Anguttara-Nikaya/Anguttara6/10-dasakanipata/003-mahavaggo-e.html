<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, we put on robes in the morning and taking bowls and robes entered S&agrave;vatthi for alms. Then it occured to us: It is too early yet to go for alms in S&agrave;vatthi. What if we approached the monastery of the wandering ascetics of other sects.</P>
<P>Then we approached the wandering ascetics of other secetics in their monastery, exchanged friendly greetings with them and sat on a side. When we were seated the wandering ascetics of other sects said to us: </P>
<P>`Friends, the recluse Gotama, teaches his disciples thus: . Come! Bhikkhus, thoroughly learn all things, and abide having learnt everything. Friends, we too teach our disciples thus: Come! friends, thoroughly learn all things, and abide having learnt everything.' Friends, so then what is the difference between us, in the intention, in advising and the advice given?'

<P>As long as the moon and sun illuminate the directions, so long the thousandfold world systems will be, with a thousand moons, suns, Himalayas, Indian peninsulars, Northern Goyanas, Northern Kuru countries, Eastern Vidhehas, four thousand great oceans, four thousand great kings, a thousand of the four guardian gods, a thousand set of thirty-three gods, a thousand set of Titans, a thousand of the states of happiness, a thousand of the states of creations, a thousand sets of those creating others and a thousand of the worlds of Brahma.

They too have a change, a disappointment. The noble disciple seeing this is disenchanted. Someone who turns away from that, turns away from the highest.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these ten are mystic spheres. What ten? One is the mystic sign of the earth, perceived above, below, across without another immeasurable. The mystic sign of water, ... re ... fire, ... re ... air, ... re ... blue, ... re ... yellow, ... re ... red, ... re ... white, ... re ... of the sphere of space, ... re ... and the sphere of consciousness, perceived above, below, across without another immeasurable.

To beings of this perception too, there is a change, a disappointment. The nobe disciple seeing this is disenchanted. Someone who turns away from that, turns away from the highest.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these eight are the masteries. What eight? A certain one with internal material perceptions sees a few beautiful and ugly external forms, mastering it says I know and I see, this is the first mastery.</P>
<P>A certain one with internal material perceptions sees innumerable beautiful and ugly external forms, mastering it says I know and I see, this is the second mastery.</P>
<P>A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions sees a few beautiful and ugly external forms, mastering it says I know and I see, this is the third mastery.</P>
<P>A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions sees innumerable beautiful and ugly external forms, mastering them says I know and I see, this is the fourth mastery.</P>
<P>A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions sees blue external forms with blue characters and blue lustre. Like the blue azure flower, or like the Kashmire cloth, which has the colour, characters and lustre beaten into it in blue, mastering it says, I know and I see, this is the fifth mastery.</P>
<P>A certain one with internal immaterial perceptions sees yellow external forms with yellow characters and yellow lustre.

A certain one perceives a little, a certain one perceives grown great, a certain one perceives immeasurably and a certain one perceives `there is nothing.' Bhikkhus, of these four perceptions the perception, `there is nothing' and abiding in the sphere of nothingness is the foremost. Beings of this perception too have a change, a disappointment.

<P>Bhikkhus, views external to this, such as `I am not, there is nothing of mine, I will not be, there will be nothing of mine' Those of this view should expect this: As long as there is loathing `to be' it will be not to him.

<P>Bhikkhus, there are recluses and Brahmins who appoint the highest purity.

The noble disciple seeing this is disenchanted. Someone who turns away from that, turns away from the highest.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, there are beings who appoint the highest extinction in this very life. Such as knowing as it really is, the arising, fading, enjoyment, dangers and escape from the six spheres of mental contact and non-holding release from them. Bhikkhus, when I say this, certain recluses and Brahmins abuse me saying unreal and not truthful things.-'The recluse Gotama does not appoint the thorough knowledge of sensuality, the thorough knowledge of matter, and the thorough knowledge of feelings. Bhikkhus, I appoint the thorough knowledge of sensuality, matter and the thorough knowledge of feelings. Here and now the hunger appeased, extinguished, become cool without a hold I appoint final extinction.</P>

<P>Venerable sir, The Blessed One has fallen to the method of welfare and pleasantness of many, establishing many in the noble norm, in the good Teaching and meritorious things.

<P>Again, venerable sir, The Blessed One is suitable for honour, for hospitality, for reverential salutation with clasped hands, the incomparable field of merit for the world. Venerable sir, seeing this good reason, I, lying low show my gratitude and gratefulness with the highest manifestations of lovingkindness to The Blessed One.</P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, The Blessed One has those topics of talk, such as topics for few desires, for satisfaction, for seclusion, for withdrawing from the company, for arousing effort, for virtues, for concentration, for wisdom, for release, and for knowledge and vision of release. Venerable sir, seeing this good reason, I lying low show my gratitude and gratefulness with the highest manifestations of lovingkindness to The Blessed One.</P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, The Blessed One is a quick and easy gainer for nothing, of the four higher abidings of the mind, the pleasant abidings here and now.

<P>Again, venerable sir, The Blessed One rcollects the manifold previous births. Such as one birth, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, innumerable forward cycles of births, innumerable backward cycles of births and innumerable forward and backward cycles of births. There I was of such name, clan, disposition, supports, experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with such a life span. Disappearing from there was born there, with such name ... re ... experiencing such pleasant and unpleasant feelings and with such a life span. Disappearing from there is born here. Thus with all details the manifold previous births are recollected. Venerable sir, seeing this good reason, I lying low show my gratitude and gratefulness with the highest manifestations of lovingkindness to The Blessed One.</P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, The Blessed One with the heavenly eye purified beyond human sees beings disappearing and appearing unexalted and exalted, beautiful and ugly, in good and evil states, knows beings according to their actions-'These good beings, endowed with bodily, verbal and mental misbehaviour, blaming noble ones, with wrong view and with the wrong view of actions, after death go to loss, to decrease, to an evil state, to hell. As for these good beings endowed with good behaviour by body, words and mind, not blaming noble ones, with right view and with the right view of actions, after death go to increase, to a good state, to heaven. Thus with the heavenly eye purified beyond human sees beings disappearing and appearing according their actions. Venerable sir, seeing this good reason, I lying low show my gratitude and gratefulness with the highest manifestations of lovingkindness to The Blessed One.</P>
<P>Again, venerable sir, The Blessed One, destroying desires, the mind released from desires and released through wisdom, here and now by himself realizing abides. Venerable sir, seeing this good reason, I lying low show my gratitude and gratefulness with the highest manifestations of lovingkindness to The Blessed One.</P>
<P>Venerable sir, now we have to go, there are many duties to be done!"</P>
