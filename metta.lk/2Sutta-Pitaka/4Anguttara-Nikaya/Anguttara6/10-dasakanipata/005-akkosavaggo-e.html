</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>44. At one time The Blessed One was living in the Baliharana forest stretch in Kusinara. The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus from there: </P>
<P>&szlig;Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu intending to accuse another bhikkhu should internally reflect five things in himself, and be internally established in five things and then accuse. What five things should he internally reflect in himself?</P>
<P>The accusing bhikkhu should reflect thus: Am I with pure bodily behaviour, endowed with matchlessly unfishered bodily behaviour. Are these things evident in me or not? If the bhikkhu be without pure bodily behaviour, without matchlessly unfishered bodily behaviour, there may be someone who tells- Come on bhikkhu! You first train in bodily good conduct.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the accusing bhikkhu should reflect thus: Am I with pure verbal behaviour, endowed with matchlessly unfishered verbal behaviour. Are these things evident in me or not? If the bhikkhu be without pure verbal behaviour, without matchlessly unfishered verbal behaviour, there may be someone who tells- Come on bhikkhu! You first train in verbal good conduct.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the accusing bhikkhu should reflect thus: Am I established in loving kindness towards the co-associates in the holy life, without aversion Are these things evident in me or not? If the bhikkhu be without established loving kindness towards co-associates in the holy life without aversion, there may be someone who tells- Come on bhikkhu! You first establish yourself in thoughts of loving kindness towards co-associates in the holy life.</P>
<P>Again, the accusing bhikkhu should reflect thus: Am I learned do I bear and accumulate the Teaching which is good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meanings even in the letters and declaring the complete and pure holy life. Am I learned in that Teaching, to recite by words, to experience it with the mind and penetrating it and have I come to right view? Are these things evident in me or not? If the bhikkhu is not learned, does not bear and accumulate the teaching which is good at the beginning, middle and end full of meanings even in the letters, declaring the pure and complete holy life. Could not recite by words, experience it in the mind and penetrating it come to right view, there may be someone who says: Come on bhikkhu! You first learn the Teaching.</P>
<P>Again, the accusing bhikkhu should reflect thus: Is the higher code of rules ingrained in me in detail and well gone home, to explain, to uphold, to judge, by way of discourses and by way of words in them. Are these things evident in me or not? If the higher code of rules be not ingrained in the bhikkhu with details and well gone home, to explain, to uphold, to judge, by way of discourses and by way of words, there may be someone who tells- Come on bhikkhu! You first train in the discipline.</P>
<P>In what five things should he be internally established?</P>
<P>I will talk at the right time, never out of time. I will talk the truth, never the untruthful. I will talk gently, never roughly. I will talk desiring the good and not desiring evil. And I will talk with loving kindness without aversion. These five things should be internally established. Bhikkhus, a bhikkhu intending to accuse another bhikkhu should internally reflect five things in himself, and be internally established in five things and then accuse.</P>

<P>Bhikkhus, here the king sits with the queen. The bhikkhu enters the inner chamber. Either the queen smiles seeing the bhikkhu or the bhikkhu smiles seeing the queen. Then it occurs to the king: 'Indeed, these two are friendly or will be friendly.' Bhikkhus, this is the first danger in entering the inner chamber of the palace.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the king has much work to do, a lot of duties. He does not recall of a certain woman's coming. She conceives on account of him Then it occurs to the king: 'None other than the bhikkhu enter the inner chamber. It is the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the second danger in entering the inner chamber of the palace.</P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the king loses a certain gem Then it occurs to the king: 'None other than the bhikkhu enters this, it is the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the third danger in entering the inner chamber of the palace.</P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, a secret talk in the inner chamber of the palace goes to external ears Then it occurs to the king: 'None other than the bhikkhu enters this, it is the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the fourth danger in entering the inner chamber of the palace.</P>

<P>Again bhikkhus, the king dismisses the army at some unsuitable monment. Then it occurs to those displeased about it: -'The king is friendly with the bhikkhu, this is the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the eighth danger in entering the inner chamber of the palace.</P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the king dismisses the army at the suitable time and when going away stops it&ograve;hen it occurs to those displeased about it: -'The king is friendly with the bhikkhu, this, is the work of the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the nineth danger in entering the inner chamber of the palace.</P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the king assembles an elephant show, a horse show, a chariot show, and an exhibition of forms, sounds, scents, tastes and touches which is not suitable for the bhikkhu' Bhikkhus, this is the tenth danger in entering the inner chamber of the palace.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>50. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. At that time many bhikkhus after the meal was over returning from the alms round were assembled in the attendance hall. Gathered and seated, they were quarrelling and disputing and were showing the weapon in their mouth to each other.</P>
<P>In the evening The Blessed One getting up from his seclusion approached the attendance hall and sat on the prepared seat. Then The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: </P>
<P>&szlig;Bhikkhus, with what talk were you gathered and seated now and what was the other conversation?</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, after the meal was over and returning from the alms round, we were assembled and seated in the attendance hall with a quarrel, disputing. We were showing the weapon in our mouths to each other and disputing.</P>
<P>&szlig;Bhikkhus, it is not suitable for clansmen like you who have gone forth out of faith to abide with a dispute and quarrel and show the weapon in your mouth to each other.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these ten things are conducive to friendliness, for reverence, to bring together to give up disputes and for unity. What ten?</P>
<P>Here, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is virtuous restrained in the higher code of rules, abides seeing fear in the slightest fault. Bhikkhus, this is a thing conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes learned, bears and accumulates the Teaching which is good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meanings even in the letters and stating the complete and pure holy life. That Teaching he recites and practises by words, and experiences it with the mind and penetratingly sees it to straighten his view. Bhikkhus, this is a thing conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again bhikkhus, the bhikkhu becomes a spiritual friend, a good associate with good friendship. Bhikkhus, this is a thing conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is suave, with gentle manners, accepting advice patiently. Bhikkhus, this is a thing, conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus the bhikkhu is with aroused effort, clever and discriminative in doing or getting done whatever things small or large that have to be done for the co-associates in the holy life. Bhikkhus, this is a thing, conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu attached to the Teaching, talks delightedly about the higher aspects of the Teaching and discipline. Bhikkhus, this is a thing, conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu abides with aroused effort to dispel demeritorious things, to accumulate meritorious things, firm not giving up the main aim in meritorious things. Bhikkhus, this too is a thing, conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is satisfied with whatever gain of robes, morsel food, dwellings and requisites when ill. Bhikkhus, this too is a thing, conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is with the highest prudent mindfulness, calling and recalling things told and heard long ago. Bhikkhus, this too is a thing, conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity.</P>
<P>Again, bhikkhus, the bhikkhu is endowed with wisdom, about the rising and fading of the five holding masses, for the noble ones' penetration to rightfully end unpleasantness. Bhikkhus, this too is a thing, conducive to friendliness, to be loved, to be revered, to give up disputes, to bring together and for unity. Bhikkhus, these ten things are conducive to friendliness, for reverence, to bring together to give up disputes and for unity.</P></FONT></BODY>
