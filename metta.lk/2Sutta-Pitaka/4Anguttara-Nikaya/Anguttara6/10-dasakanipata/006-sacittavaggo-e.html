<P>&szlig;Bhikkhus, do not become clever in penetrating and understanding others' minds, be clever in penetrating and understanding your mind. This is the right practise.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, how should you be clever in penetrating and understanding, your mind?</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, just like a woman, man or young one, fond of adornment would take a clean mirror, or water in a vessel and would see the reflection of his face in it. If he sees some dirt or some blemish in it, would try hard to dispel that dirt or blemish. If he sees no dirt or blemish in it, he would be completely satisfied on account of it.- `It is gain for me, my face is clean.' In the same manner bhikkhus, reflection in meritorious things does much to the bhikkhu.- `Do I abide coveting for most of the time or do I abide, not coveting for most of the time. Do I abide angry for most of the time or do I abide without anger for most of the time. Do I abide overcome by sloth and torpor for most of the time or do I abide free from sloth and torpor for most of the time. Do I abide restless, worrying for most of the time or do I abide without restlessness and worry for most of the time. Do I abide doubting for most of the time or do I abide doubts dispelled for most of the time. Do I abide with hatred for most of the time or do I abide without hatred for most of the time. Do I abide with a defiled mind for most of the time or do I abide without a defiled mind for most of the time. Do I abide with a violent angry body for most of the time or do I abide without a violent and angry body for most of the time.

Bhikkhus, someone whose clothes or head is on fire would arouse a lot of interest, effort, zeal, unhindered action and mindful awareness to put out that fire. In the same manner the bhikkhu should arouse a lot of interest, effort, zeal, unhindered action and mindful awareness to dispel those demeritorious things.</P>
<P>When reflecting if the bhikkhu knows, for most of the time I abide not coveting, abide without an angry mind, abide without sloth and torpor, abide balanced, abide with doubts dispelled, abide without hatred, abide with an undefiled mind, abide without a violent angry body, abide with aroused effort concentrated, then he should be established in those meritorious things and should further apply himself to destroy desires.</P>

<P>&szlig;Then friends, listen and attend carefully .</P>
<P>Friends, to whom did The Blessed One say, a decreasing person?</P>
<P>Here, friends, the bhikkhu does not attend to the Teaching that he has not heard, gets confused about the Teaching he has already heard.

<P>Friends, bhikkhus, do not become clever in penetrating and understanding others' minds, be clever in penetrating and understanding your mind. This is the right practise.</P>
<P>Friends, how should you be clever in penetrating and understanding, your mind?</P>
<P>Friends, just like a woman, man or young one, fond of adornment would take a clean mirror, or water in a vessel and would see the reflection of his face in it.

<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, venerable Girimananda is gravely ill, in much unpleasantness. It is good if The Blessed One would approach him out of compassion.</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, if you tell these ten perceptions to the bhikkhu Girimananda, there is a possibility that the bhikkhu Girimananda hearing these ten perceptions according to circumstances should get over the illness. What are the ten perceptions?</P>
<P>The perception of impermanence, lacking a self, loathing, danger, dispelling, disenchantment, cessation, non-attachment to the world, the impermanence of all determinations and the perception of in-breaths and out breaths.</P>

<P>Here, &acirc;nanda, the bhikkhu gone to the forest, to the root of a tree or to an empty house reflects: `Matter is impermanent, feelings are impermanent, perceptions are impermanent, determinations are impermanent and consciousness is impermanent. Thus he sees imperm&agrave;nence in these five holding masses. &acirc;nanda, to this is said the perception of impermanence.</P>

Thus the bhikkhu reflects the loathsomeness in the body.</P>
<P>&acirc;nanda, what is the perception of danger?</P>
<P>Here, &acirc;nanda, the bhikkhu gone to the forest, to the root of a tree or to an empty house reflects: `This body is unpleasant, has many dangers. Various illnesses arise in this body, such as illnesses of sight, hearing, nose, tongue, body, head, of the ears, mouth, teeth, lips, cough, asthma, catarrh, fits, burning, decay, diseases in the stomach, swooning,</P>
