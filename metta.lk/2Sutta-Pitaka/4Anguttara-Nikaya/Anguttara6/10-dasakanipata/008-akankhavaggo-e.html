<P>At that time many well-known Licchavis in completely full chariots were coming to the Great forest to see The Blessed One, making much noise. Then it occured to those venerable ones: `These well-known Licchavis in completely full chariots, are coming to the Great forest to see The Blessed One, making much noise. The Blessed One has said that sound is a thorn to the higher states of the mind. What if we go to the Gosinga forest reserve. It has less noise, not so crowded, we will have a pleasant abiding Then those venerable ones went to the Gosinga forest reserve which had less noise, was less crowded and had a pleasant abiding.</P>
<P>The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: &szlig;Bhikkhus, where are the elder bhikkhus, Cala, Upacala, Kukkuta, Kalimbha, Nikata, Katiss&agrave;. Where are these elder bhikkhus gone?</P>

<P>&szlig;Bhikkhus, the great elders have said it correctly! Rightly saying sound is a thorn for the higher states of the mind.</P>
<P>Bhikkhus, these ten are thorns. What ten?</P>
<P>To one who wants seclusion, company is a thorn. To one developing the sign of loathsomeness, an agreeable sign is a thorn. To one protected in the mental faculties, sight seeing is a thorn. To one leading a holy life the behaviour of a woman is a torn. To one in the first higher state of the mind, sounds are a thorn. To one in the second higher state of the mind, thoughts and discursive thoughts are a thorn. To one in the third higher state of the mind, joy is a thorn. To one in the fourth higher state of the mind, in breathing and out breathing is a thorn. To one attaining the cessation of perceptions and feelings, perceptions and feelings are a thorn. Greed is a thorn. Hate is a thorn and delusion is a thorn.</P>
