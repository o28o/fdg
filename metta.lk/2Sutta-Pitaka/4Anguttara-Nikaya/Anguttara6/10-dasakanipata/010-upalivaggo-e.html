Then the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika was daily going to see The Blessed One. One day it occured to the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika: It is not suitable to see The Blessed One at this time, he is in his seclusion. It is not suitable to see the bhikkhus who advice on mind developement, they also are in seclusion. What if I go to the monastery of the wandering ascetics of other sects?</P>
<P>Then the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika approached the monastery of the wandering ascetics of other sects. At that time the wandering ascetics of other sects were noisy and seated were talking on childish topics in a high pitch. They saw the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika coming in the distance and made gestures to each other: &szlig;Good ones, make less noise. Do not make such noise. The householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika is coming to the monastery. He is a disciple of the recluse Gotama, who wears white clothes and lives in S&agrave;vatthi. He is one who likes silence, may be he is approaching thinking the gathering is silent.</P>
<P>The wandering ascetics of other sects then became silent and the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika approached the wandering ascetics of other sects and exchanging friendly greetings sat on a side. Then the wandering sects of other sects said: </P>
<P>&szlig;Householder, tell us, of what view is the recluse Gotama?</P>
<P>&szlig;Sirs, I do not know everything about the view of The Blessed One.</P>
<P>&szlig;Householder, since you do not know the view of the recluse Gotama, tell us about the view of the bhikkhus.</P>
<P>&szlig;Sirs, I do not know about the view of the bhikkhus either.</P>
<P>&szlig;Householder, since you do not know the view of the recluse Gotama, nor the view of the bhikkhus tell us what is your view? .</P>
<P>&szlig;Sirs, that is not difficult for me, to declare of what view I am. Yet come on! You venerable ones first declare your own views and later it will be easy for me to declare my view.</P>
<P>When this was said a certain wandering ascetic said: householder, `The world is eternal! This is the truth, all others are false.' I am of this view.</P>
<P>Another wandering ascetic said: householder, `The world is not eternal! This is the truth, all others are false.' I am of this view.</P>
<P>Another wandering ascetic said: householder, `The world is limited! This is the truth, all others are false.' I am of this view.</P>
<P>Another wandering ascetic said: householder, `The world is not limited, ... re ... the soul is the body, ... re ... the soul is different from the body, ... re ... the Thus Gone One is after death, ... re ... the Thus Gone One is not after death, ... re ... the Thus Gone One is and is not after death ... re ... the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death! This is the truth, all others are false.' I am of this view.</P>
<P>When this was said, the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika said to those wandering ascetics: Sirs, whoever venerable one said -'The world is eternal, this is the truth all else is false, householder, am of this view!' This view of the venerable one, has arisen on account of unwise attention or on account of anothers' words. That view is produced, compounded, is thought out and dependently arisen. Whatever is produced, compounded, thought out and dependently arisen is impermanent. That which is impermanent is unpleasant. The venerable one is sticking to that unpleasantness and reaching up to it.</P>
<P>Sirs, whoever venerable one said -'The world is not eternal, this is the truth all else is false, householder, am of this view!' This view of the venerable one, has arisen on account of unwise attention or on account of anothers' words. That view is produced, compounded, is thought out and dependently arisen.

The Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death, this is the truth all else is false, householder, am of this view!' This view of the venerable one, has arisen on account of unwise attention or on account of anothers' words. That view is produced, compounded, is thought out and dependently arisen. Whatever is produced, compounded, thought out and dependently arisen is impermanent. That which is impermanent is unpleasant. The venerable one is sticking to that unpleasantness is reaching up to it.</P>
<P>Then the wandering ascetics said: &szlig;Householder we have declared our individual views, now tell us your view.</P>
<P>&szlig;Sirs, whatever is produced, compounded, is thought out and dependently arisen is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is unpleasant. What is unpleaslant is not mine, am not in it. It is not my self. Sirs am of that view.</P>
<P>&szlig;Householder, whatever is produced, compounded, is thought out and dependently arisen is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is unpleasant. Whatever is unpleaslant that is you. Householder, you stick to it and reach up to it.</P>
<P>&szlig;Sirs, whatever is produced, compounded, is thought out and dependently arisen is impermanent. Whatever is impermanent is unpleasant. What is unpleaslant is not mine, am not in it. It is not my self. This I have seen, as it really is, with right wwisdom. I know the escape beyond it, as it really is.</P>
<P>When this was said the wandering ascetics became silent, confused, with drooping bodies turned their faces down became thoughtful and unable to reply. When the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika knew that the wandering ascetics had become silent, confused, with drooping bodies, turned down faces were thoughtful and unable to reply back, got up from his seat and approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and related the whole conversation with the wandering ascetics to The Blessed One .</P>
<P>The Blessed One said: &szlig;Good! Householder, it is good that you from time to time dispel the deep rooted views of these foolish men according to the Teaching.</P>
<P>Then The Blessed One with a talk advised, incited, aroused, made the heart light of the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika. The householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika advised, incited, aroused and made the heart light by The Blessed One got up from his seat, worshipped, circumambulated The Blessed One and went away. Soon after he had gone The Blessed One addressed the bhikkhus: Bhikkhus, you too, who have spent a hundred rains should dispel the deep rooted views of wandering ascetics, as was done by the householder An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika.</P>

<P>&szlig;Householder, is it true that the recluse Gotama blames all austerities, scolds and blames and finds fault with those leading a hard and rough life?</P>
<P>&szlig;Sirs, The Blessed One does not blame all austerities. Does not scold, blame or find fault with those leading a hard and rough life. Sirs, The Blessed One details blaming, the blameworthy and praising the praiseworthy. The Blessed One does not declare definitely.</P>
<P>When this was said a certain wandering ascetic said to the householder Vajjiyamahi: </P>
<P>&szlig;Come on houxeholder, the way you praise the recluse Gotama, he is a nihilist and one without a concept.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sirs, I tell you, The Blessed One rightfully points out, this is merit and this demerit and this is merit and demerit. By that The Blessed One is one who, points out, not a nihilist.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>95. &ograve;he wandering ascetic Uttiya approached The Blessed One, exchanged friendly greetings, sat on a side and said: </P>
<P>&szlig;Does good Gotama say, the world is eternal. This is the truth, all else is false?</P>
<P>&szlig;Uttiya, I have not declared, the world is eternal. This is the truth, all else is false.</P>
<P>&szlig;Does good Gotama say, the world is not eternal. This is the truth, all else is false?</P>
<P>&szlig;Uttiya, I have not declared that either, the world is eternal. This is the truth, all else is false.</P>
<P>`&szlig;Does good Gotama say, the world is limited. This is the truth, all else is false?</P>
<P>&szlig;Uttiya, I have not declared, the world is limited. This is the truth, all else is false.</P>
<P>&szlig;Does good Gotama say, the world is not limited ... re ... the soul and body is the same, ... re ... the soul is different from the body, ... re ... the Thus Gone One is after death, ... re ... The Thus Gone One is not after death, ... re ... The Thus Gone One is and is not after death, ... re ... The Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death. This is the truth, all else is false?</P>
<P>&szlig;Uttiya, I have not declared that either, the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death. This is the truth, all else is false.</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama, when asked does good Gotama say, the world is eternal, this is the truth, all else is false. It was said it is not declared by me, The world is eternal, this is the truth all else is false.</P>
<P>When asked does good Gotama say, the world is not eternal, this is the truth, all else is false. It was said it is not declared by me, The world is not eternal, this is the truth all else is false.</P>
<P>When asked does good Gotama say, the world is limited, ... re ... not limited, ... re ... the soul and the body is the same, ... re ... the soul is different from the body, ... re ... the Thus Gone One is after death, ... re ... the Thus Gone One is not after death, ... re ... the Thus Gone One is and is not after death, ... re ... the Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death. This is the truth, all else is false. It was said it is not declared by me either. The Thus Gone One neither is nor is not after death, this is the truth all else is false. Then what indeed does good Gotama declare?</P>
<P>&szlig;Uttiya, I declare the Teaching having realized by meself, to my disciples for the purification of beings, for the ending of grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress for the realization of extinction.</P>
<P>&szlig;When good Gotama declares the Teaching having realized by himself to the disciples, for the purification of beings, for the ending of grief, lament, unpleasantness, displeasure and distress for the realization of extinction, is all the world or half the world or one third of it led away? When this was asked The Blessed One became silent.</P>
<P>Then it occured to venerable &acirc;nanda The wandering ascetic overcome by this evil view asks a question from the completely exalted one, the question does not go home, it is not explained, it becomes incapable to be answered. It will be for Uttiya's unpleasantness for a long time.</P>
<P>Then venerable &acirc;nanda said to the wandering ascetic: &szlig;Friend, I will give you a comparison, for some wise ones understand the meaning when a comparison is given.</P>
<P>To a neighbouring city there is a deep moat and a high wall with a single gate and a wise gate keeper who stops the unknown and allows the known to enter. He encircles round the city wall and does not see a single entrance or a hole so far as a cat to enter. The knowledge does not arise to him: This much enters the city or this much leaves the city. Yet he knows, all that enter or leave the city have to leave or enter through this gate.</P>
<P>In the same manner, the Thus Gone One is not eager whether all are led away from the world, half or one third is led away from the world. It occurs to the Thus Gone One: </P>
<P>`Whoever was led away, are led away and will be led away from the world, they all dispel the five hindrances, wisely make the finer defilements of the mind weak, develop the mind in the four establishments of mindfulness and the seven enlightenment factors as it really should be, thus they were led away, are led away or will be led away from the world. Friend, the question you asked from The Blessed One was not correctly worded Therefore The Blessed One did not explain it.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>99. Venerable Upali approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on side and said: &szlig;Venerable sir, I desire to live in forest dwellings and jungle paths.</P>
<P>&szlig;Upali, life in forest dwellings and jungle paths is difficult to bear. It is difficult to be attached to seclusion. The mind of the bhikkhu who is not concentrated is carried away by solitude. Upali, if someone says: I will abide in jungle forests to gain concentration. He could expect a sinking down or an elation.</P>
<P>Upali, a huge elephant of about seven or seven and half cubits comes to a huge pond of water. It occurs to him: `What if I descend this pond, enjoy washing my ears and back, bathe and drink and ascending the pond go where I like. 'Then the huge elephant descends to the pond, enjoys washing his ears and back, bathes, drinks and ascends from it and goes wherever he likes. What is the reason? Upali, he has a huge self, and could withstand that depth and enjoy the depth .</P>
<P>Then a hare or a cat comes and it occurs to it: If the huge elephant can why can't I.? What if I ascend the great pond, enjoy washing my ears and back, drink and bathe and ascending go where I want to go. Without considering he jumps into the great pond, and he should expect this. -Either sinking or being thrown up . What is the reason?</P>
<P>Upali the self is small, the pond is deep, it cannot withstand the depth. In the same manner, Upali if someone says: I will abide in jungle forests to gain concentration. He could expect a sinking down or an elation.</P>
<P>Upali, a baby boy would play with his own urine and excreta. Isn't it completely foolish to do so?</P>
<P>&szlig;It is, venerable sir.</P>
<P>&szlig;That boy in the meantime with his developed mental faculties would play games played by young boys such as: Playing with, a toy plough, sticks, turning somersaults, a toy windmill, toy measures, a toy cart or a small bow. Isn't this more excellent than the game he played earlier?</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>&szlig;Upali, in the meantime that boy when his mental facuties are developed, provided and endowed with the five strands of sensual pleasures would enjoy pleasant, agreeable forms cognizable by eye consciousness arousing fondness and sensual desires. Would enjoy pleasant, agreeable sounds cognizable by ear consciousness ... re ... scents cognizable by nose consciousness, ... re ... tastes cognizable by tongue consciousness, ... re ... and touches cognizable by body consciousness. Upali, isn't this more excellent than the games he enjoyed earlier?</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, Upali, the Thus Gone One, worthy, rightfully enlightened, endowed with knowledge and conduct, well gone, knower of the worlds, incomparable tamer of those to be tamed, teacher of gods and men, enlightened and blessed is born in the world. He declares the Teaching, by himself known and realized, to the world, together with its gods and men and the community of recluses and Brahmins. That Teaching is good at the beginning, middle and end, full of meaning even in the letters, declaring the pure and complete holy life.</P>
<P>A householder, or the son of a householder or someone born to a clan hears that Teaching and gains faith in the Thus Gone One. With that gain of faith he reflects: </P>
<P>`The household life is full of difficulties and defilements, the going forth is like open space.</P>
<P>Living in a household, it is difficult to lead the holy life pure and complete. What if I shave head and beard, wear yellow clothes, leave the household and go forth.</P>
<P>In the meantime leaving behind a great mass of wealth or a little wealth, a large circle of relations or a small circle of relations he shaves head and beard, wears yellow clothes and leaving home, becomes homeless.</P>
<P>Become homeless, he trains in the precepts of the bhikkhus. Giving up destroying living things, throws away stick and weapon, abides shameful with aroused compassion for all beings.</P>
<P>Putting an end to taking the not given, desiring the given, abides without theft making the self pure.</P>
<P>Leaving behind the unholy life, abides far removed from low sexuality.</P>
<P>Giving up and abstaining from telling lies, talks the truth become trustworthy to the world.</P>

<P>Abstaining from rough talk, talks words that are pleasing to the ears, go straight into the heart, noble and good mannered words, desired by the general populace.</P>

Abstains from cutting, binding and tying. Abstains from highway robbery and various deceptive ways of obtaining morsel food.</P>
<P>He is satisfied with the robe to cover the body, with the morsel food to please the stomach. Wherever he goes, he goes with all his things. Endowed with the virtues of a noble one, he enjoys the pleasantness of being free from faults.</P>
<P>Seeing a form, he does not take the sign or the detail. To one abiding with the faculty of the eye unprotected, demeritorious things of coveting and displeasure may arise. He protects the faculty of the eye. Hearing a sound, ... re ... Scenting a smell, ... re ... Tasting some food, ... re ... Experiencing a touch on the body, ... re ...

<P>Approaching and receding he becomes aware. Looking on and about he becomes aware. Bending and stretching he becomes aware. Bearing the three robes and bowl he becomes aware. Enjoying, drinking, eating and tasting he becomes aware. Going, standing, sitting and lying until awake he becomes aware and talking or keeping silence he becomes aware.</P>
<P>Endowed with this mass of virtues of the noble ones, the control of the mental faculties of the noble ones, the mindful awareness of the noble ones, he dwells secluded, at the root of a tree in the forest, a mountain grotto, a mountain cave, a cemetery, a jungle path, an open space or a heap of straw/ Gone to the forest, to the root of a tree or to an empty house he sits with crossed legs and body straight with mindfulness established in front.</P>
<P>Dispelling covetousness for the world he purifies the mind and abides with a mind free of covetousness. Dispelling aversion he abides purifying the mind of aversion with compassion for all living things. Dispelling sloth and torpor, he abides purifying the mind of sloth and torpor mindful and aware of the perception of light. Dispelling restlessness and worry, he abides with a balanced mind, appeasing the restlessness and worring. Dispelling doubts abides purifying the mind of doubts, about things that have to be done and not done.</P>
<P>Dispelling the five hindranes, wisely weakening the finer defilements, secluding the mind from sensual thoughts and angry thoughts, with thoughts and dicursive thoughts and with joy and pleasantness born of seclusion he abides in the first higher state of the mind.</P>
<P>Upali, isn't this abiding more pleasant than the previous abiding?&ucirc;</P>
<P>&szlig;Yes, venerable sir.</P>
<P>&szlig;Upali, my disciples dwell in forests and jungle paths, when they see these good things in them, not until then.</P>
