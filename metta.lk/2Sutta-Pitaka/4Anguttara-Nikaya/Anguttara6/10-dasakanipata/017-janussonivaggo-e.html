</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>167. On that full moon day the Brahmin Janussoni having bathed and dressed in a suit of linen cloth, with some freshly plucked grass in his fist, was standing close to The Blessed One. The Blessed One saw the Brahmin Janussoni bathed and dressed in a suit of linen cloth, with some freshly plucked grass in his fist standing close to him, and said: </P>
<P>&szlig;Brahmin, on this full moon day, having bathed and dressed in a suit of linen cloth and with some freshly plucked grass in your hand, why do you stand here? What is the significance of the day to the Brahmin clans?</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama, today is the day of going down to the holy fire, for the Brahmin clans.</P>
<P>&szlig;How do the Brahmins observe the day of going down to the holy fire?</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, good Gotama, on the full moon day, the Brahmins bathe and dress in a suit of linen cloth, rub wet cow dung on the ground, spread some grass on the ground and lie on the grass at the right time inside the fire house. During that night they get up three times and worship the fire with clasped hands saying: `Good one, we worship you!' They feed the fire with much ghee, oil and butter. At the end of that night they feed the Brahmins with nourishing eatables and drinks. Good Gotama, this is the ceremony of going down to the holy fire, done by the Brahmins.</P>
<P>&szlig; Brahmin, going down to the holy fire in the noble ones' discipline is something different from this.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, what is, going down to the holy fire in the noble ones' discipline? It is good if I be taught the going down to the holy fire in the noble ones; discipline.</P>
<P>&szlig;Then Brahmin, listen and attend carefully I will tell.</P>
<P>Here, Brahmin, the noble disciple reflects: </P>
<P>Results for destroying living things is in this very life and also after death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from destroying living things.</P>
<P>Results for taking the not given is in this very life and also after death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from taking the not given.</P>
<P>Results for sexual misbehaviour is in this very life and also after death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from sexual misbehaviour.</P>
<P>Results for telling lies is in this very life and also after death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from telling lies.</P>
<P>Results for slandering is in this very life and also after death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from slandering.</P>
<P>Results for talking roughly is in this very life and also after death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from talking roughly.</P>
<P>Results for frivolous talk is in this very life and also after death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from frivolous talk.</P>
<P>Results for coveting is in this very life and also after death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from coveting.</P>
<P>Results for hatred is in this very life and also after death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from hating.</P>
<P>Results for wrong view is in this very life and also after death. Judging carefully he gives up and steps down from wrong view.</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama, attending to the holy fire in the discipline of the noble ones is different from the Brahmins' attending the holy fire. The Brahmins' attending to the holy fire is not worth one sixteenth part to attending to the holy fire in the discipline of the noble ones. Good Gotama, now I undersstand, ... re ... bear `as a lay disciple who has taken refuge from today until life lasts.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>176. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in Pava in Cundakammaraputta's mango orchard. Then Cundakammaraputta approached The Blessed One, worshipped and sat on a side. The Blessed One said to him: &szlig;Cunda, how do you give your consent to the purification?</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, the Brahmins face the west, with the water spout in hand, wearing special garlands attend to the holy fire, then descend the water and give the consent for the purification Here I am one who has given the consent for the purification.</P>
<P>&szlig;Cunda, how do the Brahmins face the west, with the water spout in the hand, wearing special garlands attend to the holy fire descend the water and appoint the purification?</P>
<P>&szlig;Here, venerable sir, the Brahmins face the west, with the water spout in the hand, wearing special garlands attend to the holy fire descend the water and instruct the disciples: `Come good ones, get up early in the morning sweep the floor. If you do not sweep the floor, smear some wet cow dung on the floor. If you do not smear some wet cow dung, spread some green grass on the ground. If you do not spread some green grass on the ground, attend to the fire. If you do not attend to the fire, worship the sun with clasped hands. If you do not worship the sun with clasped hands, descend to the water up to the third time. Thus venerable sir, the Brahmins appoint the purification by turning to the west, taking the water spout in the hand, wearing garlands of special flowers,attending to the fire, worshipping the sun with clasped hands and descending to water and I have got their consent for the purification.</P>
<P>&szlig;Cunda, the purification in the discipline of the noble ones is different from the Brahmins' purifiaction, such as turning to the west, taking the water spout in the hand, wearing garlands of special flowers, attending to the fire and descending to water.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, how is the purification in the discipline of the noble ones. It is suitable that I should be taught the purification in the discipline of the noble ones.</P>
<P>&szlig;Then Cunda, listen and attend carefully.: Cunda, there comes bodily impurity in three ways. Verbal impurity in four ways and mental impurity in three ways.</P>
<P>Cunda, what are the three ways of bodily impurity?</P>
<P>Here, Cunda, a certain one destroys living things, is cruel with bloody hands, is engaged in destruction, without compassion for any living thing.</P>
<P>Takes the not given, gone to the village or forest takes the not given with a thievish mind.</P>
<P>Misbehaves sexually with those protected by the mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, relations, the clan, protected by the Teaching, with those who have a husband and liable to be punished or even someone who is garlanded at a ceremony. Cunda, one becomes bodily impure in these three ways.</P>
<P>Cunda, what are the four ways of verbal impurity?</P>
<P>Here, Cunda, a certain one tells lies. Gone to an assembly, in a gathering, amidst relations, or gone to the guild or in the midst of royality, when asked to stand witness, not knowing says I know. Knowing, says I do not know. Not seeing says I saw, or seeing, says I did not see. Thus for personal reasons or for another's good or for some small material thing he tells lies with awareness.</P>
<P>Here, someone slanders, hearing it here, tells it there, to split these. Hearing it there, tells it here to split those. Thus he splits the united, does not unite the torn apart, fond of dissension talks words to disunite.</P>
<P>Here someone talks rough words, that are sharp and piercing, words that curse others. Talks angry words that are not conducive to concentration.</P>
<P>Someone talks frivolously at the wrong time, the not truthful, unrighteous, useless words, not in accordance with the Teaching and the Discipline This is the four ways of verbal impurity.</P>
<P>Cunda, what is the three ways of mental impurity?</P>
<P>Here, a certain one covets. Seeing someone's belongings thinks they should be mine.</P>
<P>Here someone is angry, with defiled thoughts. May these beings be destroyed, may they be broken and disappear, may they not be.</P>
<P>Here, someone with wrong view has a reversed vision-'There is no good in giving, in a sacrifice or offering. There are no results for good or evil actions. There is no this world, no other world, no mother, no father. There are no spontaneously arisen beings. In this world there are no recluses and Brahmins, who have come to the right path have realized this world and the other world by themselves and declare it. Thus Cunda, there is impurity of the mind in three ways.</P>
<P>Cunda, these are the ten evil ways of acting. Endowed with these ten evil ways of acting, even if you get up early in the morning and sweep the floor it is impure, or do not sweep the floor, yet it is impure.</P>
<P>Even if you smear wet cow dung on the floor, it is impure, or do not smear wet cow dung on the floor, yet it is impure.</P>
<P>Even if you spread green grass on the floor it is impure, or do not spread green grass on the floor, yet it is impure.</P>
<P>Even if you attend to the fire it is impure, or do not attend to the fire, yet it is impure.</P>
<P>Even if you worship the sun with clasped hands it is impure, or do not worship the sun with clasped hands, yet it is impure.</P>
<P>Even if you descend to the water up to the third time it is impure, or do not descend to the water up to the third time, yet it is impure. What is the eason?</P>
<P>Cunda, because these ten evil ways of acting go on making you impure.</P>

<P>Cunda, there comes bodily purity in three ways. Verbal purity in four ways and mental purity in three ways.</P>
<P>Cunda, what are the three ways of bodily purity?</P>
<P>Here, Cunda, a certain one giving up destroying living things, become ashamed, throws away stick and weapon, arousing compassion for all living things.</P>
<P>Abstains from taking the not given, gone to the village or forest does not take the not given with a thievish mind.</P>
<P>Gives up sexual misbehaviour with those protected by the mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, relations, the clan, protected by the Teaching, with those who have a husband and liable to be punished or even someone who is garlanded at a ceremony. Cunda, one becomes bodily pure in these three ways.</P>
<P>Cunda, what are the four ways of verbal impurity?</P>
<P>Here, Cunda, a certain one abstains from telling lies. Gone to an assembly, in a gathering, amidst relations, or gone to the guild or in the midst of royality, when asked to stand witness, knowing says I know. Not knowing, says I do not know. Not seeing says I did not see, or seeing, says I saw. Thus for personal reasons or for another's good or for some small material thing he does not tell lies with awareness.</P>
<P>Does not slander, hearing it here, does not tell it there, to split these. Hearing it there, does not tell it here to split those. Thus he does not split the united, unites the torn apart, not fond of dissension talks words to unite.</P>
<P>Does not talk rough words, that are sharp and piercing, words that curse others. Does not talk angry words that are not conducive to concentration.</P>
<P>Does not talk frivolously, at the wrong time, talks truthful, righteous, useful words, in accordance with the Teaching and the Discipline This is the four ways of verbal purity.</P>
<P>Cunda, what is the three ways of mental purity?</P>
<P>Does not covet. Seeing someone's belongings does not think they should be mine.</P>
<P>Is not angry, is without defiled thoughts. Thinks may these beings be well and happy, may they maintain themselves with mental health.</P>
<P>Is with right view without a reversed vision-'There is good in giving, in a sacrifice and in an offering. There are results for good or evil actions. There is this world and other world, mother, father. There are spontaneously arisen beings. In this world there are recluses and Brahmins, who have come to the right path have realized this world and the other world by themselves and declare it. Thus Cunda, there is purity of the mind in three ways.</P>
<P>Cunda, these are the ten good ways of acting. Endowed with these ten good ways of acting, even if you get up early in the morning and sweep the floor it is pure, or do not sweep the floor, yet it is pure.</P>
<P>Even if you smear wet cow dung on the floor, it is pure, or do not smear wet cow dung on the floor, yet it is pure.</P>
<P>Even if you spread green grass on the floor it is pure, or do not spread green grass on the floor, yet it is pure.</P>
<P>Even if you attend to the fire it is pure, or do not attend to the fire, yet it is pure.</P>
<P>Even if you worship the sun with clasped hands it is pure, or do not worship the sun with clasped hands, yet it is pure.</P>
<P>Even if you descend to the water up to the third time it is pure, or do not descend to the water up to the third time, yet it is pure. What is the eason?</P>
<P>Cunda, because these ten good ways of acting go on making you pure.</P>
<P>Cunda, on account of acting endowed with these ten good ways of acting, birth as a god, a human, or any other good state is apparent.</P>
