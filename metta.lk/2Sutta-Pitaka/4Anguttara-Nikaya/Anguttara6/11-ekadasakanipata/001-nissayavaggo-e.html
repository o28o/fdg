<P ALIGN="CENTER">1. Kimatthiyasutta&uuml; &Yacute; What use are clever virtues?</P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>1. I heard thus. At one time The Blessed One was abiding in the monastery offered by An&agrave;thapi&otilde;&oacute;ika in Jeta's grove in S&agrave;vatthi. Venerable &acirc;nanda approached The Blessed One, worshipped, sat on a side and said: </P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits are clever virtues?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, clever virtues are for the reason and benefit of non-remorse.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is non-remorse?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, non-remorse is for the reason and benefit of delight.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is delight?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, delight is for the reason and benefit of joy"</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is joy?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, joy is for the reason and benefit of tranquillity.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is tranquillity?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, tranquillity is for the reason and benefit of pleasantness.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is pleasantness?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, pleasantness is for the reason and benefit of concentration.</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is concentration?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, concentration is for the reason and benefit of the vision of things as they really are"</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is the vision of things as they really are?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, the vision of things as they really are, is for the reason and benefit of turning away"</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is turning away?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, turning away is for the reason and benefit of disenchantment"</P>
<P>&szlig;Venerable sir, for what reason and benefits is disenchantment?"</P>
<P>&szlig;&acirc;nanda, turning away is for the reason and benefit of knowledge and vision of release"</P>
<P>Thus &acirc;nanda, clever virtues are for the reason and benefit of non-remorse. Non-remorse is for the reason and benefit of delight. Delight is for the reason and benefit of joy. Joy is for the reason and benefit of tranquillity. Tranquillity is for the reason and benefit of pleasantness. Pleasantness is for the reason and benefit of concentration. Concentration is for the reason and benefit of knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are. Knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are, is for the reason and benefit of turning away Turning away is for the reason and benefit of disenchantment Disenchantment is for the reason and benefit of knowledge and vision of releae. Thus, &acirc;nanda, clever virtues lead to the highest.</P>

</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>2. &szlig;Bhikkhus, someone who has clever virtues, need not intend. `May non-remorse come to me. ` It is the general rule for non-remorse to arise to a virtuous person. Someone who has no remorse, need not intend. `May delight come to me. ` It is the general rule for delight to arise to one without remorse. Someone who is delighted, need not intend. `May joy come to me. ` It is the general rule for joy to arise to a delighted one. Someone who is joyful need not intend. `May my body be appeased' It is the general rule for the joyful to experience appeasement of the body. Someone with an appeased body need not intend. `May I feel pleasant. `It is the general rule for one with an appeased body to feel pleasant. A pleasant one, need not intend. `May my mind be concentrated. ` It is the general rule for the pleasant one to be concentrated. Bhikkhus, someone with a concentrated mind need not intend. `May I know and see it, as it really is. It is the general rule for the concentrated to know and see as it really is. Bhikkhus, someone who knows and sees, as it really is, need not intend. `May I turn away. ` It is the general rule for one who knows and sees to turn away. Bhikkhus, the one who has turned away need not intend. `May I be disenchanted' It is the general rule for one who has turned away to be disenchanted. Bhikkhus, the one who is disenchanted need not intend. `May I realize knowledge and vision of release. `It is the general rule for one disenchanted to realize the knowledge and vision of release.</P>
<P>Thus bhikkhus disenchantment is for knowledge and vision of release and its benefits. Turning away is for disenchantment and its beneifts. Knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are, is for turning away and its benefits. Concentration is for knowledge and vision of seeing things as they really are, and their benefits. Pleasantness is for concentration and its benefits. Tranquillity is for pleasantness and its benefits. Joy is for tranquillity and its benefits. Delight is for joy and its benefits. Non-remorse is for delight and its benefits. Clever virtues are for non-remorse and its benefits. Thus bhikkhus, thoughts overflow from thoughts and get completed by thoughts, while they flow up and down.</P>

<P>&szlig;Saddha, concentrate like a thoroughbred horse not like an inferior horse. Saddha, when the mouth piece is given to the inferior horse, it keeps on thinking, fodder! fodder! Saddha, in the same manner, a certain inferior man gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or to an empty house abides with a mind overcome by sensual greed. He does not know the escape from arisen sensual greed as it really is. He thinks only within sensual greed. He thinks, consumed by those thoughts, is wasted and is destroyed by those thoughts. He abides with a mind overwhelmed with anger ... re ... overwhelmed with sloth and torpor, ... re ... overwhelmed with restlessness and worry, ... re ... abides with a mind overcome with doubts, not knowing the escape from them. Entangled in his doubts, he thinks, is consumed, wasted and destroyed by them. He thinks leaning on earth, water, fire and air. He thinks leaning on the sphere of space, on the sphere of consciousness, on the sphere of nothingness and on the sphere of neither perception nor non-perception. He leans on this world and thinks, on the other world and thinks. Whatever seen, heard, experienced, cognized and sought with the mind, leaning on that too he thinks, he is consumed by those thoughts, is wasted and is destroyed by that. Saddha, these are the thoughts of an infrior man.</P>
<P>Saddha, what are the thoughts of a thoroughbred horse? When the mouth piece is given to the throughbred horse, it does not think fodder, fodder! What is the reason? Saddha, when the mouth piece is given to the throughbred horse it occurs to him: `What training would the horse trainer give me today? How will I respond to it today? Thus the throughbred when given the mouth piece does not think fodder, fodder. The thoroughbred horse reflects it as a debt, a tie, an ill treatment, as a piece of bad luck to be beaten in the same manner, the thoroughbred man gone to the forest, to the root of a tree, or to an empty house abides with a mind not overcome by sensual greed. He knows the escape from arisen sensual greed as it really is. He abides with a mind not overwhelmed with anger ... re ... not overwhelmed with sloth and torpor, ... re ... not overwhelmed with restlessness and worry, ... re ... abides with a mind not overcome with doubts, knowing the escape from doubts, as it really is.

He does not lean on this world and the other world and think He does not think leaning on, whatever seen, heard, experienced, cognized and sought with the mind. Yet, he thinks.
