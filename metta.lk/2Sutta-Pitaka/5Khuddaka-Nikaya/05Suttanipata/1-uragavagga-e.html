<P ALIGN="CENTER">The farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja. </P>
</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times_CSX+"><P>I heard thus. </P>
<P>Once the Blessed One lived in the brahmin village Ekan&agrave;liya in Magadha, among the southern hills. On a certain day about five hundred people were ploughing the fields of the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja. Then the Blessed One put on robes in the morning and taking bowl and robes approached the work place of the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja. The farmer at that time was distributing food and the Blessed One approached the place where food was distributed and stood there for alms. </P>
<P>The brahmin seeing the Blessed One standing for alms said:"Recluse, I plough and sow and</P>
<P>then partake food, you too plough and sow and partake food. . "</P>
<P>The Blessed One said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Brahmin, I too plough and sow and partake food. " The brahmin said, &szlig; We do not see good Gotama's yoke, plough, plough share, driving stick or buffaloes, yet good Gotama says I plough, sow and then partake food</P>
<P>&szlig; Then the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja addressed the Blessed One in verse. </P>
<P>76. &szlig;We know the farmer too well, we do not see him ploughing. ,</P>
<P>Tell us that ploughing, we like to know your ploughing. . "</P>
<P>77. &szlig;Faith is the seed, austerities the rain, wisdom my yoke and plough,</P>
<P>Conscientiousness the pole, mind the reins, and mindfulness is my driving stick. </P>
<P>78. Restrained in body and words, I know the right amount to partake</P>
<P>Indeed I do the mowing, and forbearance is my release. </P>
<P>79. Effort is my yoked oxen, to run to the end of the yoke,</P>
<P>There if you go non-stop, you will not grieve. </P>
<P>80. Ploughing in this manner, results in the fruits of deathlessness,</P>
<P>Ploughing thus you are released from all unpleasantness. </P>
<P>Then the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja served rich porridge into a huge bronze bowl and offered it to the Blessed One and said. </P>
<P>&szlig; Good Gotama, partake of the porridge since you plough for deathlessness. </P>
<P>81. &szlig;Look, brahmin, food gained by chanting verses is not suitable for me</P>
<P>Becoming mindful of the Teaching, enlightened ones preach at the correct moment. </P>
<P>82. Offer those eatables and drinks to some perfected sage who has destroyed desires,</P>
<P>Has gone beyond doubts, it becomes a field of merit to one expecting merit. "</P>
<P>&szlig;O! Good Gotama, to whom shall I offer this porridge,"</P>
<P>&szlig;Brahmin, among gods and men, M&agrave;ras, Brahmas, and the community of recluses and brahmins, I do not see anyone who partaking this porridge, could completely digest it, other than a Thus Gone One or the disciple of a Thus Gone One. Therefore throw it to a place where there is no green, or put it into some water where there are no living things. "</P>
<P>Then the brahmin Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja threw that porridge into some water where there were no living things. That porridge thrown into the water, made a hissing sound and fumigated, like a ploughshare heated throughout the day put in the water would give a hissing sound and fumigate. Then the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja frightened and with hairs standing on end, approached the Blessed One, and putting his head at the feet of the Blessed One said:</P>
<P>&szlig;Good Gotama, now I know! To me it seems that something overturned is now re-installed. Something covered is made visible, One who has lost his way is shown the way. And as though a lamp was lighted for the dark, so that those who have eyes could see forms. Good Gotama, in various ways you have explained the Teaching. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, in the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May I gain the going forth and the higher ordination in the dispensation of good Gotama. "</P>
<P>Then the farmer Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja obtained the going forth and the higher ordination in the dispensation of the Blessed One. Soon after the higher ordination venerable Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja secluded and withdrawn from the crowd abode diligently to dispel, and before long , for whatever reason sons of clansmen rightfully leave the household and go forth, that highest end of the holy life by himself realising abode. He himself knew, birth is destroyed, the holy life is lived to the end , there is nothing more to wish for. Venerable Bh&agrave;radv&agrave;ja became one of the arahants. <SUP>1</P>

<P>He is a leader to the world together with the gods. Enlightened Ones say such are winners of the path. </P>

<P>&szlig;Good Gotama, now I know, to me it seems that something overturned is re-installed, something covered is made manifest. It seems as though the path was shown to one who had lost his way. It seems as though an oil lamp was lighted for the darkness, so that those who have eyes could see forms. In various ways good Gotama has explained the Teaching. Now I take refuge in good Gotama, the Teaching and the Community of bhikkhus. May good Gotama think of me as one who has taken refuge from today until life lasts". </P>
