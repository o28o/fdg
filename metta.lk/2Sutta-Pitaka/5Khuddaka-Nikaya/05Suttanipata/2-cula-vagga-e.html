<P>288. The brahmins did no wrong, and were protected by the Teaching</P>
<P>No one stopped them from entering any house. </P>
<P>289. For forty eight years they protected the vow of chastity</P>
<P>The early brahmins were complete with their knowledges and conduct. </P>
<P>290. Brahmins never went to another's wife, nor did they buy a wife</P>
<P>With mutual agreement they met, on equal terms. </P>
<P>291. Except in the season, at other times they abstained from sexuality, </P>
<P>Brahmins never went to women out of season. </P>
<P>292. . They honoured the holy life, virtues, straightforwardness, gentleness, </P>
<P>Austerities, not hurting, and also patience. </P>
<P>293. Of them the most steady one Mah&agrave; Brahm&agrave;</P>
<P>Did not go for sexual intercourse even in his dreams. </P>
<P>294. Those wise ones who revered him</P>
<P>Observed holy chastity, virtues and patience. </P>
<P>295. They begged for grains, beds, clothes, ghee and oil, collecting these rightfully</P>
<P>Did the sacrifice, did not kill cattle for the sacrifice. </P>
<P>296. As mother, father, brother or any other relation</P>
<P>The cow became their best friend, and medicine arose from the cow. </P>
<P>297. The cow gave them eatables, power, beauty and also pleasantness</P>
<P>Knowing this by experience, they did not kill cattle. </P>
<P>298. Brahmins with delicate huge bodies, handsome and famous were keen about their duties. , </P>
<P>These people prospered as long as the forward world cycle rolled. </P>

<P>The brahmins coveted for these worldly gains. </P>
<P>302. The brahmins discussed the matter, approached king Okk&agrave;ka and asked, </P>
<P>&szlig;Do you like much wealth and grains, for resources and wealth make sacrifices. "</P>

<P>304. Cattle, beds, clothes, women and decorated chariots, </P>

<P>307. &szlig;As water, earth, gold, wealth and grains, so the lives of cattle are accessories of humans</P>
<P>So make offerings of them for much resources and wealth. </P>
<P>308. The king thus informed by the brahmins</P>
<P>Killed hundreds and thousands of cattle in the sacrifice. </P>
<P>309. Cattle that did not hurt anyone with their feet or horns, tame like goats gave pots of milk. </P>
<P>The king took them by the horns and killed them with the sword. </P>
<P>310. Inda the king of demons looked down on it as `injustice'</P>
<P>To destroy cattle with the sword. </P>
<P>311. In the past there were three diseases: desires, constipation and decay. </P>
<P>With the destruction of cattle ninety eight diseases arose. </P>
<P>312. This is unrighteous punishment, straying from the ancients, </P>
<P>Killing those who have done no wrong and the priests were punished by the Teaching. </P>
<P>313. The ancient wise looked down at these very small things</P>
<P>When the priests had these qualities people degraded them. </P>
<P>314. With these corruptions there came a split as slaves, householders and warriors</P>
<P>And husband and wife quarrelled with each other. </P>

<P>Dishonoured their birthrights and were ruled by actions. ". . </P>
<P>When this was said the brahmin householders said: &szlig;Good Gotama, now we know. It seems as though something over turned is re-installed. Something covered was made manifest, Or as the path was told to one who had lost his way. Or it seems as though an oil lamp was lighted for the darkness, so that those who have eyes could see forms. Good Gotama has explained the Teaching in varioous ways. </P>
